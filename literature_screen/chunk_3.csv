PCB concentrations in bluefish varied  between different locations, and also among fish from a given location. A  generally decreasing gradient in PCB concentrations was evident as the bluefish  were collected away from the Superfund Site. The average sum of PCB  concentrations were highest for bluefish collected in the Upper Harbor between  Interstate-195 Bridge and Coggeshall Street Bridge (Upper Harbor), followed by  bluefish in Lower Harbor from north of Popes Island Bridge (Lower Harbor), and  bluefish from Outer Harbor south of Hurricane Barrier (Outer Harbor). The levels  of PCBs in bluefish from Clarks Cove and PCBs in bluefish from Buzzards Bay were  similar and lowest among all bluefish specimens analyzed in the present study.  Pesticide concentrations were about one order of magnitude or lower than the PCB  concentrations, and the gradient of pesticide concentrations generally followed  the gradient of PCB concentrations. Some of the commonly detected pesticides in  the order of decreasing concentrations included DDTs and metabolites, heptachlor  epoxide, endosulfan sulfate, and α-chlordane. Distribution of PCBs and  organochlorine pesticides were examined in the tissues of YOY bluefish from  Clarks Cove. PCBs and lipids in the brain samples of YOY bluefish were generally  numerically greater than PCBs in the liver samples, but these differences were  not statistically significant. PCBs and lipids in hypaxial muscle samples were  numerically greater than PCBs in epaxial muscle samples, although these two  groups of tissues were not statistically different. Despite the higher  susceptibility of lighter PCB homologs to geophysical and biogeochemical  weathering processes, the relative dominance of lighter homologs in the Upper  Harbor and Lower Harbor samples suggested ongoing or recent sources of these  lighter PCBs, particularly Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016 in this area. The  presence of heavier homologs in the Upper Harbor and Lower Harbor bluefish  samples could be attributed to Aroclor 1252 and Aroclor 1254 that were being used  in relatively smaller quantities in the manufacture of electrical components in  addition to Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016. The concentration of heavier PCB  homologs appears to increase in YOY bluefish the further away from the PCB  Superfund Site in the Acushnet Estuary the samples were collected. Principal  component analyses of PCB 153 normalized concentrations of the individual PCB  congeners resulted in two general groupings; a relatively tight group comprised  of YOY bluefish from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and Outer Harbor, and a rather  loose and more dispersed group comprised of Buzzards Bay bluefish and the tissue  samples of bluefish from Clarks Cove. Principal component analyses of major  pesticides suggested close groupings of bluefish from Clarks Cove and bluefish  from Buzzards Bay. Pesticides in bluefish from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and  Outer Harbor formed a loose group, with some bluefish from these locations  populating close to Clarks Cove and Buzzards Bay bluefish. Although PCBs have  been implicated in various behavioral and health effects in the experimental and  field studies, the deleterious effects of chronic exposure to high concentrations  of PCBs and the potential for recruitment of New Bedford Harbor YOY bluefish  population to the adult stock remains obscure. Adaptive or evolutionary  resistance to contaminants have been documented in resident species in some  highly contaminated estuaries, however similar responses have not been  investigated in the migratory species like bluefish. The results of the present  study provide a reference baseline for YOY bluefish for ""before-and-after""  comparative studies and other toxicological studies for the New Bedford Harbor  Superfund Site that is currently being remediated.",,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.04.008,"*Environmental Monitoring;Animals;Environmental Restoration and Remediation;Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated/analysis/*metabolism;Massachusetts;Perciformes/*metabolism;Pesticides/analysis/*metabolism;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis/*metabolism;Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/*metabolism;Water Pollution, Chemical/statistics & numerical data;Pesticides",NA,NA,bioaccumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides in youngoftheyear bluefish pomatomus saltatrix in the vicinity of a superfund site in new bedford harbor massachusetts and in the adjacent waters

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cohorts of fishermen's wives from the  Swedish east and west coasts were established and linked to the Swedish Medical  Birth Register for 1973-1991; 1501 children were born in the eastcoast cohort and  3553 in the westcoast cohort. Comparisons were made with regional populations and  between the cohorts. Dietary interviews were made with 69 randomly selected women  from the cohorts and 69 referents. RESULTS: The women interviewed from the east-  and westcoast cohorts ate locally caught fish more than twice as often as their  referents. Compared with the regional population, the women in the eastcoast  cohort gave birth to an increased number of infants with low birthweights (< 3000  g), whereas the opposite was seen in the westcoast cohort. Infants in the  eastcoast cohort had significantly lower birthweights than infants from the  westcoast cohort (median 3530 versus 3610 g, P < 0.001). Even after adjustment  for potential confounders, eastcoast affiliation showed an increased risk for low  birthweight (odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.18-1.76).

Unfortunately, economic  expediency and the need for rapid implementation often require that biological  control programs be based more on trial and error than on sound ecological theory  and testing. This approach has led to some remarkable successes but it has also  produced dismal failures. This point is particularly well illustrated in the  historical development and use of entomopathogenic nematodes for the biological  control of insect pests. Intense effort has focused on developing these natural  enemies as alternatives to chemical insecticides, in part because laboratory  assays indicated that these nematodes possess a broad host range. This illusory  attribute launched hundreds of field releases, many of which failed due to  ecological barriers to infection that are not apparent from laboratory exposures,  where conditions are optimal and host-parasite contact assured. For example, the  entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae is a poor choice to control  scarab larvae because this nematode uses an ambusher foraging strategy near the  soil surface whereas the equally sedentary scarab remains within the soil  profile, shows a weak host recognition response to scarabs, has difficulty  overcoming the scarab immune response, and has low reproduction in this host.  Conversely, two other nematodes, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and S. glaseri,  are highly adapted to parasitize scarabs: they use a cruising foraging strategy,  respond strongly to scarabs, easily overcome the immune response, and reproduce  well in these hosts. Increased understanding of the ecology of entomopathogenic  nematodes has enabled better matches between parasites and hosts, and more  accurate predictions of field performance. These results underline the importance  of a strong partnership between basic and applied ecology in the area of  biological control.",,10.1007/s004420050108,Biological control;Host acceptance;Host habitat-finding;Host-finding;Key words Nematode,NA,NA,ecology in the service of biological control the case of entomopathogenic nematodes

In both states the peak  occurrence came in 1976. Malaria was largely confined to highly vulnerable and  receptive areas. The problem of increased incidence was particularly associated  with the development of several irrigation and hydro-electric schemes. Improperly  maintained irrigation systems and reservoirs provided ideal breeding grounds. The  present paper examines the scope and limitations of a major anti-malaria  activity, namely residual insecticide spraying as adopted and practised in rural  vector control programmes in irrigation development project areas.

Eradication  programme, 1958-1965) and current practices are reviewed on the basis of selected  examples. In view of the current re-emergence of the disease, the states are  faced with new obstacles to residual insecticide spraying such as (a) the  development of resistance of malaria vectors to DDT and other alternative  compounds like BHC (benzene hexachloride), changing vector behaviour with  avoidance of contact with indoor insecticide deposits on walls, (c) environmental  contamination (risks of chemicals), (d) extensive use of insecticides and  pesticides for crop protection under an expanding green revolution agricultural  technology, particularly in irrigated areas and (e) the existence of outdoor  resting populations of the major vector Anopheles culicifacies and their role in  extra-domiciliary transmission, making residual insecticide spray less effective.  Spraying operations are also hindered by the persistence of certain social and  cultural factors. The custom of mud plastering, white-washing and rethatching  rural houses, for example, results in the loss of insecticide-treated surfaces.  Other outdoor rural activities persist as obstacles in attempts to break the  transmission cycle; washing, bathing and sleeping outdoors; illegal fishing and  woodcutting at night; poorly constructed make-shift structures;housing project  labourers near water sources; cattle grazing in nearby forests and human  population movements related to seasonal migrants. The chain and extent of the  transmission is dependent upon the malaria parasite carriers in the community  (both indigenous and imported types) and the degree of contact of the community  with those sites where people carry on the above activities, and on the  effectiveness of surveillance operations.",,,"*DDT;*Hexachlorocyclohexane;*Insect Vectors;*Insecticides/adverse effects;Anopheles;History, 20th Century;Humans;India;Insecticide Resistance;Malaria/epidemiology/*prevention & control;Mosquito Control/history/*methods;Socioeconomic Factors;World Health Organization;Insecticides",NA,NA,the scope and limitations of insecticide spraying in rural vector control programmes in the states of karnataka and tamil nadu in india

The detection of this odor inherently initiates an antipredator response, which increases the chance of survival for the individual. In the present study, we assessed the effect of three commonly used pesticides on the antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we analyzed the behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract following 24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate that fish exposed to 20 mu g/L. of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing behavior, suggesting an impairment of the antipredator response. For the urea-herbicide linuron and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no statistically significant effects could be detected. However, linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner to the skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity. Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides in a choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved indifferently to chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that pesticides may alter the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing that particularly fish exposed to chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation.

We acutely exposed crayfish to the agricultural chemical metolachlor. We then tested the ability of crayfish to respond appropriately to 2 chemical stimuli important to their survival: 1) detection of damaged conspecifics, and 2) location of a food source in the absence of metolachlor. A damaged conspecific, commonly known as an alarm signal, produces a chemical signal composed of bodily fluids that could signify a predation event to the individual receiving the signal. Results indicated that crayfish were unable to successfully locate a food source after being exposed to metolachlor. In the presence of an alarm signal, animals exposed to metolachlor walked faster than nonexposed animals and tended to walk in the direction of the alarm signal instead of away, as in the control animals.

Here we assess the effects of diazinon, an organophosphate insecticide, on alarm pheromone induced antipredator responses and homing behavior in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Nominal exposure concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mu g.L-1) were chosen to emulate diazinon pulses in the natural environment.

However, the pesticide significantly inhibited olfactory-mediated alarm responses at concentrations as low as 1.0 mu g.L-1. Similarly, homing behavior was impaired at 10.0 mu g.L-1.

A search of Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts and other sources showed that only 0.1% of 19,199 studies of aquatic pollution and fishes during the past 20 years have made this link. Effects on parental care and courtship have been investigated using a variety of pollutants (e.g. acidification, herbicide, thermal effluent) in several fish families (e.g. Cichlidae, Poeciliidae, Gasterosteidae, Cyprinidae).        Eleven of the 19 studies found a change in behaviour from the norm. Effects on courtship included decreases or increases in frequency of displays, increased courtship duration, or performance of male-like behaviour by masculinized females. Studies of parental care have found decreased nest-building activity, decreased offspring defence, or changes in division of parental care between the sexes. Few studies have measured reproductive success or extrapolated their results to effects on populations.        We develop a framework for exploring links between pollution and behavioural ecology which suggests potential impacts on life history trade-offs in reproduction, genetic changes in populations, and population sizes. Many reproductive behaviours of fish species are readily quantifiable and behaviours such as courtship by male guppies and other members of the Poeciliidae show some promise for pollution monitoring and behavioural toxicity tests. Choice of such assays would have to compete with the sensitivity and practicality of more traditional methods but may serve as useful complements. There is considerable scope for further research into conservation.

Fish were caged, for 96 h, in two streams located in areas with intensive use of pesticides, the Apertados (AP) and the Jacutinga (JC), and in a small stream(Godoy stream-GD) found inside a forest fragment adjacent to a State Park. Biochemical parameters, such as biotransformation enzymes 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), non-protein thiols (NPSH), lipoperoxidation (LPO), protein carbonylation (PCO) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were evaluated in various fish organs, as well as genotoxic biomarkers (damage to DNA and occurrence of micronuclei and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities). Samples of water and sediment were collected for analysis of metals (Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni, Mn, Cd and Zn), organochloride pesticides, and triazine and glyphosate herbicides. We observed an increase in liver GST activity in fish at AP and gill GST activity in fish at JC. An increase in liver LPO was also observed in fish exposed to AP and JC. The same animals also exhibited increased DNA damage and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) compared to the fish kept in GD. A number of compounds showed concentrations higher than the permitted levels, in particular, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), itsmetabolites dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH), heptachloride, diclofluanid and aldrins. These pesticides were detected at higher concentrations in water and sediment samples from AP, followed by JC and GD. The Integrated Biomarker Response Index (IBR) indicated that AP and JC (AP: 21.7 > JC: 18.5 > GD: 12.6) have the worst environmental quality.

Transfection efficiency of twelve commercially available transfection reagents were tested in the zebrafish cell lines ZFL, ZF4, and Pac2. The most efficient reagent for each cell line was selected for further experiments. Cells were transiently transfected with an Nrf2-responsive luciferase plasmid.

The latter were used to study potential oxidative stress induced by pesticides (diazinon, deltamethrin, atrazine, metazachlor, terbutylazine, diuron). Besides known inducers, Nrf2 activity was also significantly induced by diazinon, deltametrin, diuron, and metazachlor. Activation of Nrf2 by metazachlor is a novel finding.

Eggs exposed to endosulfan took longer to hatch, and the resulting fry were smaller at 1 week of age and had decreased mobility at 2 weeks of age. Upon reaching sexual maturity, these individuals also produced fewer eggs, and these eggs took significantly longer to hatch. Medaka exposed to endosulfan shortly after hatching did not differ in early mobility or foraging ability. Interestingly, upon reaching sexual maturity, these individuals produced more eggs than did unexposed females. The observed effects were not dose-dependent, with medaka exposed to intermediate concentrations of endosulfan (0.10 mug/L) exhibiting the greatest response.

Because oxidative stress is evoked by many chemicals including some pesticides, pro-oxidant factors' action in fish organism can be used to assess specific area pollution or world sea pollution.        Hepatotoxic effect of DDT may be related with lipid peroxidation. Releasing of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after HCB exposure can be realized via two ways: via the uncoupling of the electron transport chain from monooxygenase activity and via metabolism of HCB major metabolite pentachlorophenol. Chlorothalonil disrupts mitochondrial metabolism due to the impairment of NADPH oxidase function. Activation of spleen macrophages and a decrease of catalase (CAT) activity have been observed after endosulfan exposure. Excessive release of superoxide radicals after etoxazole exposure can cause a decrease of CAT activity and increase phagocytic activity of splenocytes. Anticholinergic activity of organo-phosphates leads to the accumulation of ROS and resulting lipid peroxidation. Carbaryl induces changes in the content of glutathione and antioxidant enzymes activities. The antioxidant enzymes changes have been observed after actuation of pesticides deltamethrin and cypermethrin. Bipyridyl herbicides are able to form redox cycles and thereby cause oxidative stress. Low concentrations of simazine do not cause oxidative stress in carps during sub-chronic tests while sublethal concentrations of atrazin can induce oxidative stress in bluegill sunfish. Butachlor causes increased activity of superoxide dismutase -catalase system in the kidney. Rotenon can inhibit the electron transport in mitochondria and thereby increase ROS production. Dichloroaniline, the metabolite of diuron, has oxidative effects. Oxidative damage from fenpyroximate actuation is related to the disruption of mitochondrial redox respiratory chain. Low concentration of glyphosate can cause mild oxidative stress.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  295     Total Times Cited:  310     Cited Reference Count:  119,,reactive oxygen species;antioxidant defence systems;organochlorine pesticides;organophosphates;pyrethroids;bipyridyl herbicides;triazine herbicides;FRESH-WATER FISH;KILLIFISH FUNDULUS-HETEROCLITUS;ANTIOXIDANT ENZYME-ACTIVITIES;BULLHEAD AMERIURUS-NEBULOSUS;TROUT ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS;CHANNA-PUNCTATUS BLOCH;PLATICHTHYS-FLESUS L.;PRIMARY CULTURED-HEPATOCYTES;CATFISH ICTALURUS-PUNCTATUS;CARP CYPRINUS-CARPIO;Pesticides;Oxidative Stress,NA,NA,a review oxidative stress in fish induced by pesticides

For a period of 30 days, groups of adult male guppies were exposed to vinclozolin, p,p ' -DDE, or the therapeutic antiandrogen flutamide (used as positive control) applied to the fodder at concentrations between 0.1 and 100 mug/g fodder.

All three chemicals caused profound alterations at increasing levels of biological organization, even in these fully matured males. At the cellular level, the three compounds induced a significant reduction in the number of ejaculated sperm cells. At the organ level, the sexually attractive orange-yellow coloration was reduced in area and discolored, and treated fish also had smaller testes.

The ""smooth"" pattern was typically shown as a normal movement behavior, while the ""shaking"" pattern was frequently observed after treatments of diazinon. These smooth and shaking patterns were selected for training with an artificial neural network. Parameters characterizing the movement tracks, such as speed, degree of backward movements, stop duration, turning rate, meander, and maximum distance movements in the y-axis of 1-min duration, were given as input (six nodes) to a multi-layer perceptron with the backpropagation algorithm. Binary information for the smooth and shaking patterns was separately given as the matching output (one node), while eight nodes were assigned to a single hidden layer. As new input data were given to the trained network, it was possible to recognize the smooth and shaking patterns of the new input data. Average recognition rates of the smooth pattern decreased significantly while those for the shaking pattern increased to a higher degree after treatments of diazinon. The trained network was able to reveal the difference in the shaking pattern in different light phases before treatments of diazinon.

Herein, the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) was continuously exposed to environmentally realistic levels of diuron from the fertilised egg stage to the adult stage. Behavioural evaluation of adult marine medaka indicated that exposure to diuron increased anxiety in the light-dark test and increased predator avoidance. In addition, diumn exposure significantly reduced aggression, social interaction, shoaling, and learning and memory ability. However, only negligible variations in foraging behaviour and in behaviour in the novel tank test were observed. Marine medaka chronically exposed to diuron also showed decreased levels of dopamine in the brain, and changes were observed in the transcription of genes related to dopamine synthesis, degradation and receptors. Exposure to 5000 ng/L diumn caused significant downregulation of the expression of the genes of tyrosine hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase and significantly upregulated the expression of the genes of the D-5 dopaminergic receptor. The relative expression of the D-4 dopaminergic receptor was significantly upregulated in the 50, 500 and 5000 ng/L diuron-treated groups.

More recent longitudinal studies in rural and urban areas have assessed exposure by measuring urine and blood biomarkers in children and mothers during pregnancy, thus allowing effects to be associated with a particular chemical family or pesticide. Prenatal exposure to persistent organochlorine insecticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and dichlorodiphenyldi-chloroethylene (DDE) is associated with developmental delays and possibly an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in agricultural areas. In Guadeloupe, impairments of fine motor skills in young children, particularly boys, have been associated with maternal concentrations during pregnancy of chlordecone (a persistent organochlorine insecticide formerly used on banana plantations). Studies of cohorts of children from several countries describe various neurodevelopmental impairments associated with the highest maternal concentrations of organophosphates and chiorpyrifos insecticide metabolites measured during pregnancy. These include disturbances in psychomotor development, impaired visual function, cognitive and attention deficits, and behaviors related to ASD. Prenatal and postnatal exposure to newer pyrethroid insecticides is associated with alterations in social and emotional development, cognitive, language and motor deficits, and a possible increased risk of ASD. A possible effect of herbicides such as glyphosate on child neurodevelopment remains to be established. Experimental studies in rodents and fish exposed to insecticide pesticides describe effects on behavior, locomotion and cognitive functions, consistent with the associations reported in epidemiological studies and changes observed in different brain areas. Modes of action such as oxidative stress, alterations in neurotransmission systems, neuroinflammation, changes in gene expression and the diversity of molecular targets may account for the variety of effects reported.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  74,10.1684/ers.2021.1615     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),organochlorine pesticides;organophosphate pesticides;pyrethroids;herbicides;neurodevelopment;PYRETHROID INSECTICIDE EXPOSURE;CHLORPYRIFOS EXPOSURE;PRENATAL EXPOSURE;DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROTOXICITY;ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDES;GESTATIONAL EXPOSURE;GLYPHOSATE;ATTENTION;DISORDERS;PREGNANCY;Only Child;Pesticides;Child,NA,NA,pesticides and neurodevelopment in children

When given independently at environmentally realistic concentrations, propiconazole and tebuconazole (triazoles fungicides) were not toxic for G. pulex, 3-iodo-2-propinyl butyl carbamate (IPBC, fungicide) was moderately toxic, and cypermethrin (pyrethroid insecticide) was extremely toxic. 96-h LC50 were, respectively, 4703, 1643, 604, and 0.09 mu g L-1. When amphipods were submitted to a mixture mimicking the composition of a commercial solution (18.2% of cypermethrin, 45.8% propiconazole, 17.2% tebuconazole, 18.8% IPBC), the overall toxicity was equal to that of the most toxic component, namely cypermethrin. But, when organisms were submitted to the real commercial mixture containing pesticides, solvents and additives, the toxic effects were markedly higher. Moreover, a third mixture with only 0.002% cypermethrin showed lethality 2.5-18-fold higher than those predicted by the commonly used models.

In the present study, zebrafish embryos and larvae were used to study the effects of the insecticide diazinon and the herbicide diuron in regard to occurrence of oxidative stress-related cellular responses, multixenobiotic resistance (MXR)-related efflux transporter activitywhich represents the first line of defense against xenobiotics in many aquatic organismsand responses of different molecular and biochemical biomarkers.ResultsThe recently established non-invasive quantitative plate assay, which uses the fluorescent probes CM-H(2)DCFDA and CellTracker Green CMFDA and measures the fluorescence in whole zebrafish larvae, was applied to assess changes in reactive oxidative species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) after exposure to the investigated pesticides. The results showed a significant increase of GSH after 1h exposure of zebrafish larvae to both diazinon and diuron. Regarding the ROS induction, no significant increases in fluorescence could be detected after 2h exposure to the investigated pesticides. Applying a newly adapted assay for MXR activity, it was determined that diuron caused no change after a 24-h exposure, but caused a significant induction of MXR activity after a 48-h exposure (indicated by a decreased amount of accumulated rhodamine B). On the other hand, diazinon caused an inhibition of MXR activity after both 24h and 48h exposure (indicated by an increased amount of accumulated rhodamine B). Regarding the biomarkers, different set-ups and exposure periods were applied and both molecular (gene expression) and biochemical (enzymatic activities) responses were assessed. Diazinon caused an inhibition of carboxylesterase (CES) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in zebrafish larvae, diuron inhibited AChE activity in in vitro testing, and both pesticides significantly affected gene expression and activities of some of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family enzymes.ConclusionsThe obtained results show various effects of the investigated pesticides and will help to elucidate how aquatic animals cope with pesticides present in their environment.

However an increase in plasma glucose was noted in fish exposed to 10 mg L-1 of the herbicide, indicating a typical stress response. Catalase liver activity also showed an increase in fish exposed to 10 mg L-1 of the herbicide, suggesting the activation of antioxidant defenses after Roundup exposure.

The time point 0 control group gradient map showed a noticeably different swim pattern from those of the >= 12.5 mu g CPF/L groups, which was statistically supported by the differences for residence times seen in >= 12 corresponding areas. The control group gradient maps for time points 20 and 40 differed from those of the respective >= 12.5 mu g CPF/L groups. The comparative analysis of the residence times in the corresponding 15 areas revealed differences in >= 5 areas for time point 20 and in >= 3 areas for time point 40. The integrative analysis of the gradient maps and the numerical statistics revealed stage-specific effects and a concentration-response relationship between CPF and alterations on forced medaka swimming despite the dissipation of CPF from the water column.

Most eggs contained a wide range of OCs, the main compounds being DDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide, oxychlordane, hexachlorobenzene and mirex. Levels of an additional ten OCs and five polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) congeners were also determined for some sites. Overall, levels varied significantly among colonies, but there was no obvious relationship to spatial distribution of contaminants in sediments or fish species. OC levels in eggs had declined by up to 84% since 1974. Eggshells were only 8% thinner than before the introduction of DDT, and shell thinning was not a cause of breeding failure. Average reproductive output varied from 0.15 to 1.57 young per apparently occupied nest in 1983: at 56% of colonies the value was below that thought necessary to maintain stable populations. The main causes of failure were egg disappearence and cannibalism of chicks. Despite this, the population appeared to have been increasing at about 4% per annum.

Therefore, we applied Multi-omics  techniques to reveal the response of the intestinal barrier to CPZ exposure and  explore whether the Bifidobacterium intervention experiment can repair the  damage. First, we found that exposure to CPZ at environmentally relevant  concentrations led to intestinal injury phenotype, significantly down-regulated  intestinal protein gene expression, and up-regulated pro-inflammatory gene  expression, further causing intestinal dysbacteriosis and metabolic disorders. In  particular, by combining analysis of gut microbiota and metabolites, we noticed  acetate, a key metabolite, which decreased sharply after exposure to high  concentration of CPZ. Expectedly, after supplementing with Bifidobacterium (a  core bacterium that produces acetate), we noticed that the acetate content was  quickly restored. Further, we also verified that the increase in acetate content  after Bifidobacterium supplementation at least partially promoted IL-22  secretion, which in turn stimulated the secretion of β-defensins (zfbd-1, zfbd-2,  zfbd-3), thereby repairing the intestinal damage.

In this study, we investigated a causal relationship between  high levels of glucocorticoids and susceptibility to pathogens and modification  of gene expression profiles in Senegalese sole. For this purpose, we carried out  two experiments using post-metamorphic individuals (21 days after hatching) that  were exposed to dexamethasone (DXM), a potent glucocorticoid, in order to mimic  cortisol effects. We quantified transcript levels of a wide set of genes involved  in innate immune system (g-type lysozyme and hepcidin (hamp1)), HPI axis (crf,  crfbp, pomcα, pomcβ, gr1 and gr2), HPT axis (tgb), cellular stress defense system  (hsp70 and hsp90aa), GH/IGF axis (igf-I and igf-Ir) and the neuropeptide trh.  Short-term exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 ppm DXM provoked a reduction of pomcβ  transcripts and an increase of crfbp mRNAs in a dose-dependent manner at 48 and  72 h after treatment. Moreover, g-type lysozyme transcript levels decreased  significantly at 72 h whereas hamp1 mRNA levels increased at 48 h after exposure.  Long-term DXM treatment (10 ppm DXM) affected negatively weight of soles (~20%  lower than controls). Moreover, reduced mRNA levels were observed for pomcβ after  1 week and igf-I and hamp1 after 2 weeks. In contrast, crfbp and crf increased  mRNA levels after 2 weeks. hsp70 exhibited a dual response increasing transcript  levels at 1 week after treatment and reducing thereafter. No significant changes  in gene expression were observed at any time during this study for tgb, trh,  hsp90aa, pomcα, gr1 and gr2.

Here we describe the systemic destruction of macrophages and  neutrophils by the Gram-negative Photobacterium damselae ssp. piscicida (Phdp) in  fish pasteurellosis, a deadly systemic infection. Following experimental  inoculation, Phdp spreads by bacteraemia and colonizes the organs, producing a  septicaemic infection, and secretes the apoptogenic exotoxin AIP56 which is  systemically disseminated. In experimental and natural pasteurellosis,  destruction of macrophages and neutrophils by secondary necrosis following  caspase-3-associated apoptosis was seen predominantly in the spleen, head kidney  and gut lamina propria. Identical phagocyte destruction occurred after injection  of rAIP56, but not of heat-inactivated rAIP56, or AIP56-negative Phdp strains,  indicating that AIP56 is responsible for phagocyte destruction occurring in  pasteurellosis. Active caspase-3 and active neutrophil elastase are present in  the blood in advanced infection, indicating that phagocyte lysis by secondary  necrosis is accompanied by release of tissue-damaging molecules. The  AIP56-induced lysis of phagocytes represents a very efficient, self-amplifying  etiopathogenic mechanism, because it results in two effects that operate in  concert against the host, namely, evasion of the pathogen from a crucial defence  mechanism through the destruction of both professional phagocytes, and release of  tissue-damaging molecules.

The birds  are very aggressive and showed to be a serious pest. They spread germs and  diseases for human health and food production. Therefore, the birds need to be  controlled. Our research focuses on identifying food preferences of raven and on  the way raven control is most effective. Ravens are omnivorous birds. From our  laboratory study it was seen that most preferable foods were, in descending  order: fresh fishes, cow liver, crustacean, watermelons, tomatoes and yoghurt.  Under field conditions where stomach content was dissected, animal matters showed  to a more preferred food source than plant matters. Observations on olfactory  sensitivity showed that ravens could easily locate their food. Biological  observations in the field on reproduction of ravens showed that raven females lay  two to six eggs. Average number of babies per nest was between one and four.  Average number of raven flock before sun rise was more than 100, while it was  less than 100 before sun set. The impact of mechanical, biological and chemical  control was investigated. Without control, approximately flock numbers of more  than 100 ravens were recorded. The average number of raven flock was 60 before  mechanical control operation (nests destroyed and using net), while it was 40  after mechanical control.

SnrA is 240 amino acids in length and  shares 87% sequence identity to the Escherichia coli homolog, E. coli  nitroreductase A (NfsA). SnrA is the major nitroreductase in S. enterica serovar  Typhimurium strain TA1535 and catalyzes nitroreduction through a ping-pong bi-bi  mechanism in a NADPH and flavine mononucleotide (FMN) dependent manner.

Although the whitefly is often controlled using chemical pesticides,  biological control agents constitute an important component in integrated pest  management programs, especially in protected agriculture. One of these agents is  the wasp Eretmocerus mundus (Mercet) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae). E. mundus lays  its egg on the leaf underneath the second-third instar nymph of B. tabaci. First  instars of the wasp hatch and penetrate the whitefly nymphs. Initiation of  parasitization induces the host to form a capsule composed of epidermal cells  around the parasitoid. The physiological and molecular processes underlying B.  tabaci-E. mundus interactions have never been investigated. RESULTS: We used a  cDNA microarray containing 6,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the whitefly  genome to study the parasitoid-whitefly interaction. We compared RNA samples  collected at two time points of the parasitization process: when the parasitoid  first instar starts the penetration process and once it has fully penetrated the  host. The results clearly indicated that genes known to be part of the defense  pathways described in other insects are also involved in the response of B.  tabaci to parasitization by E. mundus. Some of these responses included  repression of a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) and induction of a  melanization cascade. A second set of genes that responded strongly to  parasitization were bacterial, encoded by whitefly symbionts. Quantitative  real-time PCR and FISH analyses showed that proliferation of Rickettsia, a  facultative secondary symbiont, is strongly induced upon initiation of the  parasitization process, a result that supported previous reports suggesting that  endosymbionts might be involved in the insect host's resistance to various  environmental stresses. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine the  transcriptional response of a hemipteran insect to attack by a biological control  agent (hymenopterous parasitoid), using a new genomic approach developed for this  insect pest. The defense response in B. tabaci involves genes related to the  immune response as described in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster.  Moreover, endosymbionts of B. tabaci appear to play a role in the response to  parasitization, as supported by previously published results from aphids.",,10.1186/1471-2164-9-342,"*Symbiosis;*Transcription, Genetic;Animals;Bacteria/*growth & development;Genes, Insect/*immunology;Hemiptera/*microbiology/parasitology;Host-Parasite Interactions;Wasps/*physiology;Bacteria",NA,NA,parasitization by the wasp eretmocerus mundus induces transcription of genes related to immune response and symbiotic bacteria proliferation in the whitefly bemisia tabaci

L.",,eng,,,"In order to quickly assess potential environmental hazards of forwardly deployed military bases, we have focussed our efforts on biochemical and molecular changes  in vertebrate cells following exposure to aqueous soil extracts. To this end, we  are designing a series of deployable transgenic fish. Fish exhibit many of the  same general defenses against toxic chemicals as do mammals, including enzyme  induction, and the generation of oxidative stress. In response to many foreign  compounds that generate oxidative stress, the transcription of certain protective  genes is induced via specific DNA motifs called electrophile response elements  (EPREs). We have made a plasmid construct containing a single murine EPRE fused  to a minimal promoter and the cDNA encoding firefly luciferase (EPRE-LUC). In  this paper, we have shown that the treatment of zebrafish cell line ZEM2S with a  variety of chemicals known to induce EPRE-dependent transcription in cultured  mammalian cells, results in dose-dependent induction of the  transiently-transfected EPRE-LUC reporter construct. Compounds tested include  aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and organophosphates. We observed similar  dose-dependent responses when we treated ZEM2S and human cells in vitro with  identical aqueous extracts of soil from hazardous waste sites. This suggests that  the mechanism by which these compounds activate transcription is well conserved  between mammals and zebrafish, and that transgenic zebrafish lines containing  EPRE-driven reporter constructs might be useful as sentinels for the early  detection of oxidative stress-inducing chemicals.",,10.1016/s0048-9697(01)00742-2,"*Oxidative Stress/drug effects;Animals;Animals, Genetically Modified;Apoptosis/drug effects;Cell Line;Cell Survival/drug effects;Coleoptera;Embryo, Mammalian;Embryo, Nonmammalian;Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/*physiology;Genes, Reporter;Glutathione Disulfide/metabolism;Glutathione/*metabolism;HL-60 Cells;Humans;Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology;Luciferases/*genetics/metabolism;Mammals;Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology;Methylcholanthrene/toxicity;Mice;Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology;Plasmids;Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins/toxicity;Promoter Regions, Genetic;Sentinel Surveillance;Soil Pollutants/analysis/*toxicity;Zebrafish;Oxidative Stress",NA,NA,oxidative stress in zebrafish cells potential utility of transgenic zebrafish as a deployable sentinel for site hazard ranking

Residues of chlorinated hydrocarbon  pesticides and PCBs were looked for in 224 samples, mostly feed components. The  analytical method used involved solvent extraction, florisil-column clean-up,  thinlayer chromatographic separation and gas-chromatographic determination.  Chlorinated hydrocarbons were found in several samples. DDT and its  transformation products were detected in 66 samples (29.5%), lindane in 44  (19.5%), PCBs in 25 (11.2%), alpha-BHC in 22 (9.8%), beta-BHC in 11 (4.9%) and  dieldrin in 9 (4.0%).

Effects of single, sublethal pesticide exposure  on macrophages were determined by analysis of the cell viability, cell adherence  capacity, generation of superoxide anion (O2-), antigen processing, phagocytosis  of Salmonella typhimurium, and resistance to in vitro virus-induced cytopathic  effects (cpe) after infection with mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3). Most of the  studies were done for the organochlorine pesticide dieldrin, which inhibited  several macrophage functions, such as phagocytosis of S. typhimurium, release of  the single processed protein antigen avidin, and resistance to MHV3 virus-induced  cpe. The virus-induced cytolysis in macrophage cultures was significantly  increased after in vivo exposure to single sublethal doses of other selected  pesticides, such as guthion, carbofuran, sevin, and matacil. However, none of the  selected pesticides, used in sublethal (0.4 less than or equal to LD50 less than  or equal to 0.6) doses appeared to be a factor impairing the O2- -generating  system in chemically elicited or immunologically activated peritoneal  macrophages. In conclusion, sublethal pesticide exposure can induce a significant  impairement of several macrophage functions, such as phagocytosis, antigen  processing, and resistance to virus-induced cytolysis.

The  membrane damage was measured as the level of release of the UV-absorbing material  into the medium in which the cells were suspended and as the level of uptake of  propidium iodide in individual cells by flow cytometry. It was shown that of the  compounds tested, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (cetyltrimethylammonium  bromide [CTAB]) bound most efficiently. Tetradecyl betainate chloride (B14),  tetradecanoylcholine bromide (C14), tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB),  and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) followed and had declining degrees of  binding efficiency.

For the two remaining tetradecyl  compounds (C14 and TTAB), still smaller proportions were bound at low  concentrations, but the proportions rose disproportionally at increasing  concentrations to a distinct maximum at concentrations of 0.2 to 0.5 times the  CMC. We propose that interfacial micelle-like aggregates are formed at the cell  surface as a step in the binding process. An analogous, but less conspicuous,  maximum was seen for DTAB. Thus, great differences in the binding affinity of  QACs with different hydrocarbon chains at different concentrations to C. albicans  were observed.

In the 1920""s to 1930s, thousands of people suffered from this disease in the country. Enormous efforts  were required to prevent further spread of the disease. A network was set up,  which consisted of a research institute and stations. A total of 200,000 cases of  malaria were still notified in 1934. Rapid development of the health  infrastructure and better socioeconomic conditions improved the malaria situation  and reduced the number of cases in 1946. Malaria was completely eradicated in  Armenia in 1963, and the malaria-free situation retained till 1994. During that  period, comprehensive activities were undertaken in the country to prevent and  control malaria. Since 1990, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the  situation became critical in many newly independent states. Economic crisis,  human migration, worsening levels of health services, and the lack of necessary  medicines, equipment, and insecticides significantly affected the malaria  epidemiological situation in the country. Malaria cases started to penetrate into  Armenia from neighboring countries. In 1994, a hundred ninety six military men  contacted malaria in Karabakh, which was unfavorable in terms of malaria, as well  on as the border with Iran and along the Araks river. The first cases recorded in  Armenia were imported, afterwards they led to the incidence of indigenous cases,  given the fact that all the prerequisites for malaria mosquito breeding and  development were encountered in 17 regions and 3 towns of the country. In 1995,  there were 502 imported cases and in 1996 the situation changed: out of 347  registered cases, 149 were indigenous. The Ministry of Health undertook a range  of preventive measures. In 1997 versus 1996, the total number of malaria cases  increased 2.3-fold: 841 registered cases of which 567 were indigenous (a 3.8-fold  increase). The overwhelming majority of cases were recorded in the Ararat and  Armavir marzes. In 1998, there were a total of 1156 cases, of them 542 being  locally contacted. The situation became stable thanks to joint efforts of WHO,  IFRX, the Armenian Red Cross Society, UNICEF, the Ministry of Health of Armenia  and its Government. Under Minister's Decree No. 292 of May 17, 1999, a malaria  project implementation office was established in the Masis Sanitary and  Epidemiological Surveillance Center of Hygienic and Antiepidemic Surveillance to  improve progress of the malaria control programme in Armenia. WHO allocated some  7,700 USD for 5-month maintenance and work of the office. Thus, analyzing the  malaria cases registered in 1999 and 1998 indicates a 1.9-fold decrease (616/77).  The setting up the malaria programme field office under the Minister's decree was  instrumental in planning and implementing activities in situ. In 1999, four cases  of tropical malaria were recorded in Armenia. The patients were Armenian pilots  who contacted malaria during duty travels: 1 in Sudan and 3 in Congo. The list of  pilots making flying to endemic countries was submitted to the Republican Center  to implement preventive measures in the future. In Armenia malaria surveillance  has been improved to ensure timely detection of all suspected cases and to carry  out malaria control activities. In this regard, a seminar was held for 21  entomologists and 12 parasitologists. UNICEF and WHO Armenian offices provided a  substantial support to organize seminars. To facilitate the seminars, the manual  ""Malaria parasitology and entomology"" was published and distributed among their  participants. On April 19, 1999, the session of the Ministry's Executive Board  (Collegium) gave recommendations to reinforce malaria control activities in the  country. Decrees No. 256 of May 31, 1999, No. 47 of May 29, 1999, and No. 245 of  April 30, 1999, ""On malaria and preventive and control activities"" were issued by  the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of Internal  Affairs and National Security to serve as a guideline for planning and  implementing activities. The Ministry of Agriculture undertook to clean the  collective irrigation (drainage) system covering 102 and 77 km in the Ararat and  Armavir marzes, the Ministry of Health provided a list of endemic foci where  cleaning was a priority. Taking into account the importance of the people's  participation in ensuring effective prevention and control, emphasis was laid on  health education activities: publication of leaflets, as well as articles in  local newspapers, radio broadcasts and TV shows. Throughout the season, the early  detection of malaria cases, timely hospitalization (in no later than 1-3 days)  for at least 5 days and subsequent treatment under direct supervision of a  physician were successfully carried out due to home-to-home visits. Entomological  studies conducted in the malaria foci show an increase in the presence and  density of a malaria vector in the buildings. As far as treatment is concerned,  the overall surface of stagnant waters comprised 2642 ha in 1999 (2733 ha in  1998), including 1285 ha of anophelogenic stagnant waters (2276 ha in 1998). The  biggest stagnant water surfaces were in the Ararat and Armavir marzes--2209 ha,  where the majority of malaria cases were recorded. A total of 1,283,111 and  559,213 sq. m. of constructions were treated in 1999 and 1998, respectively, out  them there were 1,259,637 sq. m. in 5 endemic regions. Stagnant water surfaces  were treated with bacticulicides on 250.7 and 743.8 (almost 3 times more) in 1998  and 1999, respectively. In 1999, 740 ha of surface were biologically treated  using Gambusia compared to 900 ha treated in 1998. There is no highly qualified  diagnostic specialists in many regions of the country, which necessitates the  holding of further seminars involving relevant specialists, in all malaria  regions. There is a tendency of geographical spread of malaria: malaria cases  occur in new regions and dwellings. A country-wide action plan was drafted for  2000, mainly focusing on staff training. With WHO assistance, a seminar was held  for 324 specialists from endemic regions. During the first quarter of 2000, 13  cases of tertian malaria were recorded as compared 59 cases during the same  period of last year. All these patients contacted malaria in the previous season  and demonstrated long incubation periods. Thus, the malaria control plan  recommended by WHO and the rational and targeted use of its assistance has shown  a 2-fold decrease in the incidence of malaria.",,,Armenia/epidemiology;Humans;Malaria/epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission;Travel;Malaria;Armenia,NA,NA,armenia implementation of national program of malaria control

Therefore, we conducted a 20 d exposure  experiment to investigate its effects on the hepatopancreas and intestine of E.  sinensi.

Organotin (OT) pesticides have been used in industrial and agricultural  applications, and OT contamination has been reported in water, sediment, and  fish. Carbamate pesticides are currently used in agricultural chemicals. Two  specific carbamates used in agriculture are ziram and maneb; ziram also is used  as an additive in rubber products including latex gloves. In previous studies we  demonstrated that at concentrations in the 150-200 nM range, the OTs tributyltin  (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT) were capable of disrupting the function of human NK  cells after incubations to as short as 24 h. Previously, we also examined the  effects of ziram and maneb at higher concentrations on the cytotoxic function of  human NK cells. The current study examined the effects of exposure of up to 6  days to lower concentrations of each of these compounds on the cytotoxic function  of NK cells. The OTs were studied at concentrations ranging from 200 to 10 nM;  ziram was studied at concentrations of 2.5 microM-125 nM and maneb at  concentrations of 10-1 microM. These conditions were studied both in highly  purified NK cells and in a mixture of lymphocytes containing both T and NK cells.  As little as 25 nM TBT decreased the function of purified NK cells after 24 and  48 h, whereas 10 nM TBT was effective after 6 days. The lowest level of TPT that  was effective at 24 h was 50 nM whereas the results after 48 h and 6 days were  similar to those seen with TBT. The presence of T lymphocytes diminished the  effects of both TBT and TPT on NK cytotoxic function. A concentration of ziram as  low as 125 nM produced significant loss of cytotoxic function in highly purified  NK cells (65% decrease in function after 6 days).

However, exposing farmed creatures to water contaminated with pesticides is one of the current challenges. This study aims to investigate the defensive impact of diets containing varying amounts of vitamin C on the growth, digestive enzyme activity, immune response, and resistance of Caspian roach (Rutilus rutilus caspicus) exposed to diazinon. Fish (average weight: 1.12 ± 0.17 g) were fed diets containing 0 (control; C0), 500 (C1), 1000 (C2), and 1500 (C3) mg/kg of vitamin C for 56 days. Then they were exposed to diazinon stress for 14 days (0.32 mg/liter). The highest final weight and lowest feed conversion ratio were obtained in fish fed a diet containing vitamin C. The highest protease activity and lowest amounts of lipase and amylase were observed in the C3 group. At the end of the feeding period, lysozyme activity, total immunoglobulin amount, and complement (ACH50) in the C3 treatment were significantly higher than in the control treatment. After the stress period, lysozyme and complement activity were higher in all groups fed vitamin C supplements than in the control treatment. The highest levels of stress indicators (cortisol and alkaline phosphatase) were detected in the control group before and after stress. Based on the preparation of gill tissue sections, most lesions included edema, hyperplasia, adhesion of secondary lamellae, and necrosis of gill-covering cells. Overall, the results indicate that adding vitamin C to the diet can be used as a sustainable bioremediation tactic and reduce the adverse effects of diazinon exposure in Caspian roach. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: M.

Therefore, it was a challenging project to explore the innovative antifungal compound delivery system for improving bioavailability. The superior adhesive fungicide formulation was supposed to be an efficient pathway to enhance transmembrane permeability and biological activity. According to abundant phenolic hydroxyl groups, tannic acid (TA) was an ideal modified adhesive biomaterial to improve interfacial interactions. The fundamental purpose of this research was focused on the synergistic mechanism of TA-interfacial-modified Pro-ethyl cellulose (EC) nanoparticles for improving bioavailability and biosafety. In the stability test, TA-modified Pro-EC nanoparticles had the capacity to reduce Pro initial release burst, extending a persistent validity and improving anti-photodegradation property. The toxicity index of Pro-EC and Pro-EC-TA was approximately 2.93-fold and 4.96-fold that of Pro technical against Fusarium graminearum (F. graminearum), respectively. Compared with nonmodified EC nanoparticles, TA-modified EC nanoparticles obtained eminent transmembrane permeability and superior adherence ability to F. graminearum, for hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of TA to enhance interaction with target cell membranes. The contents of cellular reactive oxygen species induced by Pro-EC and Pro-EC-TA nanoparticles were about 2.31 times and 3.00 times that of the control check (CK), respectively. Compared to the CK group, the membrane potential and ergosterol values of F. graminearum treated with Pro-EC-TA nanoparticles were drastically reduced by 74.91 and 56.20%, respectively. In the biosafety assay, the maximum half-lethal concentration value of the TA-modified Pro-EC nanoparticles indicated that the acute toxicity of the Pro-EC-TA nanoparticles to adult zebrafish was approximately 8.34-fold reduced compared to that of the Pro technical. These findings demonstrated that the successful interfacial modification of Pro-EC nanoparticles with TA was a highly efficient, environmentally safe, and promising alternative for sustainable agricultural application, thus making the fungicide formulation process more simplified, easier fabrication, and lower cost. © 2023 American Chemical Society","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: X.

Tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP), triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO), and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) dominated 12 detectable OPEs (∑OPEs), with concentrations ranging widely from 0.56 to 352 ng/g (dry weight basis). The ∑OPE levels in sediments varied significantly across fishing harbors of various grades, and within the same grade, highlighting uneven distribution of OPE sources and inputs to harbors. The first- and second-class fishing harbors had higher geometric mean of ∑OPE contents compared to center and natural harbors, reflecting higher OPE pollution in these areas. Although there were significant correlations among the OPE congeners with high detection frequencies, the composition patterns of sediment OPEs varied considerably among fishing ports. The sediments in the center and first-class harbors had higher abundance of non-chlorinated OPEs (non-Cl-OPEs), suggesting heterogeneity in source strength and pollution characteristics of Cl- and non-Cl-OPEs in fishing ports. The distribution of OPEs in sediments was weakly associated with sediment organic carbon, but not socioeconomic variables, indicating complex controlling factors of their distributions in port sediments. The ecological risks of sediment OPEs were evaluated, and while OPE accumulations ranged broadly (7–684 ng/cm2), exposure hazards were negligible. The sediments in first- and second-class fishing harbors, which had greater OPE accumulation, were identified as reservoirs of OPEs in port aquatic environments. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: Z.

In our view, modern eco-agriculture in China can be considered an essential path to the modernization of China’s agriculture because of its origin from China’s traditional agriculture, absorbing modern achievements in science and technology, and applying a modern management system of industry, which also gives new meaning to China’s eco-agriculture. However, the modernization of China’s eco-agriculture continues to face huge challenges in ensuring food security, ecological safety, nutrition security, inheritance of traditional farming culture, and the realization of common prosperity. Consequently, by maintaining a systematic approach, upholding fundamental principles, and breaking new grounds, China’s eco-agriculture should make considerable breakthroughs aimed at innovating the typical model of ecological agriculture, strengthening the research and development of agricultural green inputs, accelerating the development and application of new equipment for ecological agriculture, promoting the operational capacity of industrial chains, and improving the policy and mechanism of ecological compensation. The practical pathes would focus on maize and soybean intercropping, rice-fish co-culture, green house planting-breeding, indoor vertical eco-farm innovation of typical models; new slow/controlled release fertilizer, new liquid fertilizer, biochar based fertilizer, microbial fertilizer, micronutrient fortifier, green smart fertilizer, green manure crop, photo-micro fertilizer, CO2 gas-fertilizer; biological pesticide, natural enemies and pollinating insects, new insect trapping equipment; biodegradable mulch film and soil remediation technology & product in green inputs area; advanced agricultural basic equipment, intellisense technology, cloud-brain technology, intelligent control/management technology, internet of things based on integrated ground-airspace, platform of space breeding laboratory, recycling system of organic waste, integrated biological control system for diseases, insect pests and weeds, indoor vertical farming system in agricultural equipment area; community supported agriculture, ecological leisure and health care, cloud ecological farm, green international trade in operation of modern industrial chain; and Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP), Gross Economic-Ecological Product (GEEP), and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) in agricultural policy making. In summary, based on China’s actual conditions, there is an urgent need to innovate and develop the modern industrial and technological system of China’s eco-agriculture by relying on the two-wheel drive of agricultural science and technology and rural reform, which would provide Chinese solutions for the sustainable development of world agriculture in future decades. © 2023 Science Press.

In this study, P. clarkii were exposed to 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 mg/L abamectin, immune- and antioxidant-related enzymes activities, genes expression levels, and histological observations were used to analyze the defense capacity of P. clarkii to abamectin. With increasing abamectin concentration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and malondiadehyde (MDA) content increased significantly. Meanwhiile, acid phosphate (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activities, total haemocyte counts (THC), and Crustin expression level decreased significantly, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and GPX expression level also decreased significantly.

Zebrafish were used to study the neurotoxicity of ACT and its chiral isomers. Our study reveals that the R-ACT, Rac-ACT, and S-ACT induce neurotoxicity in zebrafish larvae by impairing vascular development and disrupting the blood-brain barrier. These detrimental effects lead to apoptosis in brain cells, hindered development of the central nervous system, and manifest as altered swimming behavior and social interactions in the larvae. Importantly, the neurotoxicity caused by the S-ACT exhibits the most pronounced impact and significantly diverges from the effects induced by the R-ACT. The neurotoxicity associated with the Rac-ACT falls intermediate between that of the R-ACT and S-ACT. Fascinatingly, we observed a remarkable recovery in the S-ACT-induced abnormalities in BBB, neurodevelopment, and behavior in zebrafish larvae upon supplementation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This observation strongly suggests that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway serves as a major target of S-ACT-induced neurotoxicity in zebrafish larvae. In conclusion, S-ACT significantly influences zebrafish larval neurodevelopment by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, distinguishing it from R-ACT neurotoxic effects. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: Y.

However, as strategies focus on increasing production for a more secure food system, food loss and waste (FLW) exist as food is transferred to each supply chain player and even during consumption. The study aimed to provide information on the current state of food loss and waste in the Philippines. FLW during consumption is more detrimental as each step input adds value to the food item. In the Philippines, where every single grain is vital, the Food Waste Reduction Act was introduced. This law aimed to reduce food waste through donations and recycle food as fertilizer or compost. Aside from the staple rice, other agricultural commodities with more than 20% waste at postharvest are bananas, cabbage, calamansi, eggplant, mangoes, sweet potato, and tomato. The food industry also plays a vital role in reducing waste, and some identified recommendations are creating a weekly menu to avoid buying too much, storing food properly and strict practice of first-in-first-out to minimize spoilage, promoting food preservation processing to utilize and extend shelf life of in-season fruits and vegetable and reducing the serving sizes. Other contributors to food waste are the surge of zoonotic diseases such as the African Swine Fever (ASF) and natural disasters. Considering all the players and contributors, FLW is indeed multi-faceted, and to reduce it warrants collaborative efforts of various agencies to continuously launch awareness campaigns, implement the use less of or do without concept to avoid leftovers and improve methods of storing foods and develop FLW measurement protocols whereby targets are set and FLW are regularly monitored. It is high time that FLW is in the spotlight to curb the lack of consistent access to food among the poor. © 2023 The Authors.

To address this challenge, delivery systems, such as pathogen infection stimuli-responsive carriers, can be employed to augment the efficiency of fungicide utilization. The bursting of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a common defense response of host plants to pathogenic infections. In this study, ROS-responsive mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) modified with phenyl sulfide (PHS) as azoxystrobin (AZOX) carrier (MSN-PHS-AZOX) were fabricated. Results demonstrated that MSN-PHS-AZOX exhibited fungicide release kinetics dependent on ROS. In vitro inhibition experiments confirmed the fungicidal effect of MSN-PHS-AZOX on Botrytis cinerea, relying on external ROS. In vivo leaf experiments showcased the superior persistence of MSN-PHS-AZOX in compared to AZOX SC. Furthermore, MSN-PHS-AZOX exhibits favorable biosafety and lower toxicity to aquatic zebrafish compared to AZOX SC, with no adverse impact on cucumber leaf growth.

Activated microglia secrete pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, which subsequently promote neurodegeneration. Formyl peptide receptor-1 (FPR1) of CNS microglia functions as pattern recognition receptor and is activated by N-formylated peptides, leading to microglial activation, induction of inflammatory responses and resulting neurotoxicity. In this study, it was hypothesized that FPR1 activation of microglia causes loss of dopaminergic neurons by activating inflammasome and upregulating IL-1β, IL-6 or TNF-α and that FPR1 antagonist HCH6-1 exerts neuroprotective effect on dopaminergic neurons. FPR1 agonist fMLF induced activation of microglia cells by causing activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and upregulation and secretion of IL-1β, IL-6 or TNF-α. Conditioned medium (CM) of fMLF-treated microglia cells, which contains neurotoxic IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, caused apoptotic death of differentiated SH-SY5Y dopaminergic neurons by inducing mitochondrial oxidative stress and activating pro-apoptotic signaling. FPR1 antagonist HCH6-1 prevented fMLF-induced activation of inflammasome and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in microglia cells. HCH6-1 co-treatment reversed CM of fMLF-treated microglia-induced apoptotic death of dopaminergic neurons. FPR1 antagonist HCH6-1 inhibited rotenone-induced upregulation of microglial marker Iba-1 protein level, cell death of dopaminergic neurons and motor impairment in zebrafish. HCH6-1 ameliorated rotenone-induced microglial activation, upregulation of FPR1 mRNA, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, cell death of SN dopaminergic neurons and PD motor deficit in mice. Our results suggest that FPR1 antagonist HCH6-1 possesses anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting microglial activation and upregulation of inflammasome activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: C.-C.

It mostly affects people in low-income regions, 90% of reported cases being in developing countries. Schistosoma has a complex lifecycle, alternately infecting mammalian hosts and snails. The snails hosting the parasite are the most viable targets. Selective preparations for reducing the parasite pool in snails and infected water are required as current molluscicides are also nontoxic to other organisms, including fish, and thus affect food supplies in infected areas. Plants (e.g. Annona crassiflora Mart., A. muricata L., and A. montana Macfad.) are attractive potential sources as alternative molluscicides and novel entity to treat the disease owned to their diverse biologically potent compounds including; saponins, alkaloids, terpenoids, and tannins. Additionally, they can be locally cultivated, providing income for farmers and reducing treatment costs. Here, we review plants, plant extracts and isolated compounds that have shown activities against the host snails or Schistosoma in various parts of its life cycle. Plants have a lot of potential and will continue to contribute feasible, effective medicines and/or pesticides; more research is warranted to fully explore their future applications.

The kidney, critical organ of the endocrine system in fish, is susceptible to some pollutants in the aquatic system. This study aimed to investigate the comprehensive effects and toxicological mechanisms of cypermethrin (CMN) on fish kidneys. The findings derived from the in vivo experiments demonstrated that exposure to CMN resulted in notable damage to the kidneys of grass carp, accompanied by impairment to the antioxidant defense system of kidney tissue, inducing severe oxidative stress. The activities of T-SOD, CAT, and GSH decreased, and lipid peroxidation product MDA content increased sharply. Subsequently, p-PERK, p-eIF2α, GRP78, and IRE1 significantly increased, suggesting a disturbance in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. In addition, excessive oxidative stress and ER stress initiated programmed apoptosis. At cellular level in vitro, the changes of CMN did on damage degree of grass carp kidney cells were verified. Toxicity mechanism was consistent with the in vivo test. The information provided herein emphasized the assessment of pollution caused by the toxic organic insecticide CMN effects on the food chain of marine organisms. The results of this study revealed potential nephrotoxic mechanisms of CMN in fish and provide essential data for the safety monitoring and rational application of CMN. Together, these results shed light on protein homeostasis mechanisms that may help manage misfolded proteins under oxidative stress conditions. © 2024 The Institution of Chemical Engineers","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: H.

Plant pigments normally exhibit non-negligible absorbance in the UV-visible region. As a result, the signals of a typical near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe could be disturbed through primary inner filter effect if it is excited by UV-visible light during plant sample analysis. In this work, an NIR-excitable AChE-activated fluorescent probe was biomimetically designed and synthesized. And the NIR-excitation strategy was utilized for the anti-interference detection of organophosphate and carbamate pesticides in colored samples with this probe. Sensitive and rapid response to AChE and pesticides was achieved due to the high affinity of the biomimetic recognition unit in the probe. The limits of detection for four representative pesticides including dichlorvos, carbofuran, chlorpyrifos and methamidophos reached 0.0186 μg/L, 2.20 μg/L, 12.3 μg/L and 13.6 μg/L, respectively. Most importantly, fluorescent response to pesticide contents could be accurately measured in the coexistence of different plant pigments by this probe, and the measured results showed completely irrelevance to the plant pigments and their colors. Taking advantage of such probe, the new developed AChE inhibition assay showed good sensitivity and anti-interference ability in the detection of organophosphate and carbamate pesticides in real samples. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: Z.

Objective: To evaluate the association between perinatal exposure to 27 potential EDCs and ASD among Norwegian children, and to further examine the neurodevelopmental toxicity of associated chemicals using zebrafish embryos and larvae. Method: 1,199 mothers enrolled in the prospective birth-cohort (HUMIS, 2002–2009) study. Breastmilk levels of 27 chemicals were measured: polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and perfluoroalkyl substances as a proxy for perinatal exposure. We employed multivariable logistic regression to determine association, utilized elastic net logistic regression as variable selection method, and conducted an in vivo study with zebrafish larvae to confirm the neurodevelopmental effect. Results: A total of 20 children had specialist confirmed diagnosis of autism among 1,199 mother–child pairs in this study. β-Hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH) was the only chemical associated with ASD, after adjusting for 26 other chemicals. Mothers with the highest levels of β-HCH in their milk had a significant increased risk of having a child with ASD (OR = 1.82, 95 % CI: 1.20, 2.77 for an interquartile range increase in ln-transformed β-HCH concentration). The median concentration of β-HCH in breast milk was 4.37 ng/g lipid (interquartile range: 2.92–6.47), and the estimated daily intake (EDI) for Norwegian children through breastfeeding was 0.03 µg/kg of body weight. The neurodevelopmental and social behavioral effects of β-HCH were established in zebrafish embryos and larvae across various concentrations, with further analysis suggesting that perturbation of dopaminergic neuron development may underlie the neurotoxicity associated with β-HCH. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to β-HCH was associated with an increased risk of specialist-confirmed diagnoses of ASD among Norwegian children, and the EDI surpasses the established threshold. Zebrafish experiments confirm β-HCH neurotoxicity, suggesting dopaminergic neuron disruption as a potential underlying mechanism. © 2023 The Author(s)","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: M.

Here, we investigated whether habitats with different agricultural pressures influenced acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity – a biomarker for exposure to pesticides, respiration rate, and resistance to starvation in the ground beetle Poecilus cupreus. Two differently structured landscapes were selected for the study, one dominated by small (S) and another by large (L) fields. Within each landscape three habitat types were selected: in the S landscape, these were habitats with medium (M), small (S) and no canola (meadow, 0) coverage (i.e., SM, SS, S0), and in the L landscape habitats with large (L), medium (M) and no canola (meadow, 0) coverage (i.e., LL, LM, L0), representing different levels of agricultural pressure. The activity of AChE was the highest in beetles from canola-free habitats (S0 and L0), being significantly higher than in beetles from the SM and SS habitats. The mean respiration rate corrected for body mass was also the highest in S0 and L0 beetles, with significant differences between populations from L0 vs. SS and from S0 vs. SS. Only beetles from S0, SS, L0, and LM were numerous enough to assess the resistance to starvation. Individuals from the LM habitat showed better survival compared to the canola-free habitat in the same landscape (L0), whereas in S landscape the SS beetles survived worse than those from S0, suggesting that characteristics of L landscape may lead to developing mechanisms of starvation resistance of P. cupreus in response to agricultural pressure. © 2023, The Author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: G.

The high prevalence of comorbidities associated with epilepsy, such as cognitive dysfunction, affects the patients quality of life. Adenosine signaling modulation might be an effective alternative to control seizures and epilepsy-associated comorbidities. This study aimed to verify the role of adenosine modulation on the seizure development and cognitive impairment induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) in zebrafish. At first, animals were submitted to a training session in the inhibitory avoidance test and, after 10 min, they received an intraperitoneal injection of valproate, adenosine A1 receptor agonist cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), adenosine A2A receptor antagonist ZM 241385, adenosine deaminase inhibitor erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nony1)-adenine hydrochloride (EHNA) or the nucleoside transporter inhibitor dipyridamole. Thirty min after the intraperitoneal injection, the animals were exposed to 7.5 mM PTZ for 10 min, where they were evaluated for latency to reach the seizure stages (I, II, and III). Finally, 24 h after the training session, the animals were submitted to the inhibitory avoidance test to verify their cognitive performance during the test session. Valproate, CPA, and EHNA showed antiseizure effects and prevented the memory impairment induced by PTZ exposure. DPCPX, ZM 241385, and dipyridamole pretreatments caused no changes in seizure development; however, these drugs prevented memory impairment without altering locomotion. Our results reinforce the antiseizure effects of adenosine signaling and support the idea that the involvement of adenosine in memory processes may be a target for preventive strategies against cognitive impairment associated with epilepsy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: C.D.

They also undergo daily fluctuations in salinity and act as filters for pollutants. Additionally, global climate change (GCC) is altering salinity regimes within estuarine systems through changes in precipitation and sea level rise. GCC is also likely to lead to an increased use of insecticides to prevent pests from damaging agricultural crops as their habitats and mating seasons change from increased temperatures. This underscores the importance of understanding how insecticide toxicity to fish changes under different salinity conditions. In this study, larval Inland Silversides (Menidia beryllina) were exposed to bifenthrin (1.1 ng/L), cyfluthrin (0.9 ng/L), or cyhalothrin (0.7 ng/L) at either 6 or 10 practical salinity units (PSU) for 96 h during hatching, with a subset assessed for end points relevant to neurotoxicity and endocrine disruption by testing behavior, gene expression of a select suite of genes, reproduction, and growth. At both salinities, directly exposed F0 larvae were hypoactive relative to the F0 controls; however, the indirectly exposed F1 larvae were hyperactive relative to the F1 control. This could be evidence of a compensatory response to environmentally relevant concentrations of pyrethroids in fish. Effects on development, gene expression, and growth were also observed. Overall, exposure to pyrethroids at 10 PSU resulted in fewer behavioral and endocrine disruptive effects relative to those observed in organisms at 6 PSU. © 2024 The Authors.

Their negative effects on parental fish are investigated while intergenerational effects at environmentally relevant concentrations remain unclear. In this study, F0 zebrafish exposed to IMI and THM (0, 50, and 500 ng L-1) for 144 days post-fertilization (dpf) was allowed to spawn with two modes (internal mating and cross-mating), resulting in four types of F1 generations to investigate the intergenerational effects. IMI and THM affected F0 zebrafish fecundity, gonadal development, sex hormone and VTG levels, with accumulations found in F0 muscles and ovaries. In F1 generation, paternal or maternal exposure to IMI and THM also influenced sex hormones levels and elevated the heart rate and spontaneous movement rate. LncRNA-mRNA network analysis revealed that cell cycle and oocyte meiosis-related pathways in IMI groups and steroid biosynthesis related pathways in THM groups were significantly enriched in F1 offspring. Similar transcriptional alterations of dmrt1, insl3, cdc20, ccnb1, dnd1, ddx4, cox4i1l, and cox5b2 were observed in gonads of F0 and F1 generations. The findings indicated that prolonged paternal or maternal exposure to IMI and THM could severely cause intergenerational toxicity, resulting in developmental toxicity and endocrine-disrupting effects in zebrafish offspring. © 2023 American Chemical Society","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: W.

However, compared to functional studies of their related genes (e.g., mammalian CD300 family) in eliminating pathogen invasion while preserving homeostasis, the roles of pIgRL in teleost fish remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that a pair of pIgRL molecules in zebrafish, pIgRL3.5 and pIgRL4.2, were highly expressed in the intestine and immune cells. Moreover, we constructed an Edwardsiella piscicida infection model, which induced strong inflammatory responses in the zebrafish intestine. Interestingly, pIgRL3.5 and pIgRL4.2 exhibited opposite inducible expression patterns in response to bacterial infection, suggesting that they perform different roles. More importantly, by conducting overexpression and knockdown experiments, our findings demonstrated that zebrafish pIgRL3.5 played a protective role in host defense against E. piscicida infection by inhibiting excessive inflammatory responses. In contrast, pIgRL4.2 facilitated pathogen growth and dissemination in zebrafish intestine. Collectively, our findings are the first to demonstrate that a pair of pIgRL molecules in teleost fish play opposite roles in mucosal immune response to bacterial infection.

Procambarus clarkii is one of the most important economic aquatic animals in China. It is necessary to explore the toxic mechanism of abamectin to P. clarkii. In this study, the toxic mechanism of abamectin to P. clarkii was investigated by 0, 3 and 6 μg/L abamectin stress for 28 days. The digestive-, antioxidant- and immune- related enzymes activities, genes expression levels, and histological observations were analytical indicators of growth performance, digestive capacity, and defense systems. The results in this study showed that with abamectin concentration increasing, the growth of P. clarkii was stunted significantly, and the mortality rate increased significantly. With exposure time and abamectin concentration increasing, the expression levels of related genes, the activities of digestive-, antioxidant-, and immune- related enzymes decreased ultimately. Moreover, through histological observation, it was found that with abamectin concentration increasing, the hepatopancreas, muscle, and intestine were damaged. As elucidated by the results, once abamectin exists in the environment for a long time, even low doses will threaten to healthy growth and survival of P. clarkii.

In this study, we involved zebrafish to explore the new mechanism of TPhP inducing oxidative stress and ferroptosis to promote neurodevelopmental toxicity. The results suggested that TPhP affected the embryonic development, reduced the number of new neurons, and led to abnormal neural behavior in zebrafish larvae. TPhP also induced ROS accumulation, activated the antioxidant defense signal Nrf2 and Keap1, and significantly changed the activities of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). In addition, TPhP induced ferroptosis in zebrafish, which was reflected in the increase of Fe2+ content, the abnormal expression of GPX4 protein and genes related to iron metabolism (gpx4a, slc7a11, acsl4b, tfa, slc40a1, fth1b, tfr2, tfr1a, tfr1b and ncoa4). Astaxanthin intervention specifically inhibited ROS levels, and reversed SLC7A11 and GPX4 expression levels and Fe2+ metabolism thus alleviating ferroptosis induced by TPhP. Astaxanthin also partially reversed the activity of AChE, GST and the expression of neurodevelopmental-related genes (gap43, gfap, neurog1 and syn2a), so as to partially rescue the embryonic developmental abnormalities and motor behavior disorders induced by TPhP. More interestingly, the expression of mitochondrial apoptosis-related protein BAX, anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2, Caspase3 and Caspase9 was significantly altered in the TPhP exposed group, which could be also reversed by Astaxanthin intervention. In summary, our results suggested that TPhP exposure can induce oxidative stress and ferroptosis, thereby causing neurodevelopment toxicity to zebrafish, while Astaxanthin can partially reverse oxidative stress and reduce the neurodevelopmental toxicity of zebrafish larvae by activating Nrf2/Keap1/HO-1 signaling pathway. © 2024 The Authors","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: K.

Because of habitual exposure, there are concerns about toxicity including neurotoxicity that could result in neurological, psychiatric, or cognitive impairment. We recently found that a single injection of glyphosate inhibits long-term potentiation, a cellular model of learning and memory, in rat hippocampal slices dissected 1 day after injection, indicating that glyphosate-based herbicides can alter cognitive function. Glyphosate-based herbicides could adversely affect cognitive function either indirectly and/or directly. Indirectly, glyphosate could affect gut microbiota, and if dysbiosis results in endotoxemia (leaky gut), infiltrated bacterial by-products such as lipopolysaccharides could activate pro-inflammatory cascades. Glyphosate can also directly trigger pro-inflammatory cascades. Indeed, we observed that acute glyphosate exposure inhibits long-term potentiation in rat hippocampal slices. Interestingly, direct inhibition of long-term potentiation by glyphosate appears to be similar to that of lipopolysaccharides. There are several possible measures to control dysbiosis and neuroinflammation caused by glyphosate. Dietary intake of polyphenols, such as quercetin, which overcome the inhibitory effect of glyphosate on long-term potentiation, could be one effective strategy. The aim of this narrative review is to discuss possible mechanisms underlying neurotoxicity following glyphosate exposure as a means to identify potential treatments. © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

The organophosphate pesticide pollutants are emerging contaminants, which threatens the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem. Monocrotophos (MCP) is an organophosphate insecticide, utilized on crops including rice, maize, sugarcane, cotton, soybeans, groundnuts and vegetables. MCP is hydrophilic in nature and their solubilizing properties reduce the soil sorption which leads to groundwater contamination. The half-life period of MCP is 17–96 and the half-life period of technical grade MCP is 2500 days if held stable at 38 °C in a container. MCP causes mild to severe confusion, anxiety, hyper-salivation, convulsion and respiratory distress in mammals as well as aquatic animals.

The genus Bacillus encompasses several known probiotics capable of surviving harsh feed processing and extended storage conditions. More importantly, these microbes can still confer probiotic benefits even when administered to animals in the form of spores. Therefore, the screening of Bacillus strains with probiotic potential holds significant importance for aquaculture. In our study, we screened a total of 75 Bacillus strains, leading to the identification of a promising candidate strain, Bacillus velezensis (BSG-2), which has the excellent performance of antagonism towards pathogenic bacteria including Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella piscicida, and Nocardia seriolae.

In addition, BSG-2 has a prominent ability to endure harsh environment and secret digestive enzymes, which indicated that BSG-2 has the potential to survive and promote digestion in the intestinal tract through the gastrointestinal tract. Importantly, feeding 56 days, BSG-2 increased activities of digestive and immune-related enzymes, and then promoted growth and decreased mortality and tissue damage of largemouth bass after Nocardia seriolae infection.

Studies on biocontrol agents combined with natural insecticides and their possible effects on the immune defense mechanisms of termites are limited. In this study, we investigated the effects of a combined biocontrol strategy using a plant-derived insect ATPase inhibitor, α-terpineol, with the entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) Steinernema carpocapsae against the subterranean termite Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki. Survival assays showed that even a low lethal concentration of α-terpineol significantly increased the EPNs-induced virulence in C. formosanus. α-terpineol treatment majorly inhibited the activity of Na+- K+- ATPase, which disturbed the EPNs-induced enhancement of locomotor activity and grooming behavior in termites treated with the combined strategy. Furthermore, the combination treatment had a synergistic inhibitory effect on innate immune responses in C. formosanus, which were measured as changes in the expression of immune-related genes and activities of immune system enzymes. In conclusion, α-terpineol can weaken the immune defense of termites against EPNs at low lethal concentrations, and is a suitable non-synthetic insecticide to prove the biocontrol efficiency of EPNs on C. formosanus. This study provides a theoretical basis and technical reference for a novel biocontrol strategy that promises to overcome the problems of host immune defense in termites. © 2023","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: Z.

However, little is known if these variables can affect antiparasitic sensitivity. In this context, the aim of the study was to determine how temperature and light can induce changes in the parasite sensitivity profile to azamethiphos. Temperatures of 9, 12, 15, and 17 °C and two light conditions were evaluated through sensitivity evaluation in vitro bioassays. Parasites were exposed to an azamethiphos concentration gradient of 0, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 ppb. A range of temperature between 12 °C and 15 °C did not significantly change the sensitivity profile of the parasite. Moreover, light conditions did not induce significant changes in the sensitivity profile either. However, the temperature of 9 °C induced higher effective concentrations (EC50) than the rest of the temperatures, but also lower affectation and mortality of the parasite. This evidence suggested that sensitivity to azamethiphos decreases with temperature, regardless of the light conditions. These results are considered relevant since strong variations of environmental conditions (like temperature) among seasons and geographical areas could impact salmon–parasite interactions, but also the effectiveness of the treatments applied in the salmon industry. Even more, in a climate change context, for which temperature is considered one of the main variables, it is expected that important changes occur in the biology, metabolism, and population dynamics of parasites, fish, and marine animals, being these changes a matter of concern in the future sustainability of aquaculture. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: M.P.

Pyrethroids are the fourth major group of insecticides in use worldwide and have extremely negative effects on aquatic fauna. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of an acute 2 h sub-lethal exposure to different levels of the pyrethroid esfenvalerate on the swimming behaviour of two Cypriniformes species: the native Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) and the non-native invasive bleak (Alburnus alburnus). The experimental set-up consisted of previous exposure to three esfenvalerate concentrations (control, 1.2 (low), and 2.0 (high) μg/L) before being stocked in a three-artificial-flume-channel mesocosm for behavioural trials through direct observation. Monitored behaviours included (i) routine activity, (ii) shoal cohesion, and iii) boldness. Significant differences in fish behaviour were detected for the native species (barbel), as individuals spent significantly more time holding position (i.e., resting) in the control (44.9%) than in the high esfenvalerate concentration (25.2%). Concordantly, control barbels were also found to perform more directional changes than the ones exposed to high esfenvalerate concentrations. Behavioural changes were also found for boldness, measured by the proportion of fish attempts to negotiate the upstream ramp, which were significantly higher in the control (37.4%) and in the high concentration (41.5%) compared to the low one (21.1%). Finally, regarding shoal cohesion of the barbel, it was tighter in the control (81.3%) than in the low- (70.5%) and high- (71.1%) esfenvalerate treatments. For the invasive bleak, there were no significant differences in any of the behavioural traits upon previous exposure to an increasing esfenvalerate concentration. This experimental study demonstrated that even short-term exposure to the pyrethroid esfenvalerate was sufficient to alter the behaviour of a native Cypriniformes fish species while not affecting the non-native species. This may confer greater competitive advantages to non-native fish species in the context of global changes. © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: T.

Essentially, sustainable agriculture involves holistic management of livestock, crops and fisheries, so as to make the farming process self-sustaining for a longer period. Food and agriculture sector contributes heavily in meeting the human demands and thus sustainable agricultural practices would result in positive and long-lasting consequences. Sustainable growth in the field of agriculture can be achievable by the intervention of advanced technologies such as nanotechnology. Conventional farming methods failed to fully utilize the available resources. To circumvent these limitations, nanotechnology can be effectively used to enhance the crop quality and productivity. Applications of nanotechnology in the field of agriculture will lead to improved plant growth, stabilization of soil and microbes, targeted usage of chemicals and most importantly nanotechnology contributes profoundly for waste management. The enhanced activity displayed by the nanoparticles is essentially because of their extremely small size resulting in larger surface area. Nanoparticles are used as seed priming agents resulting in enhanced seed germination rate, consequently favouring for overall growth of the plant. Nanocapsulated fertilizers and pesticides brought a revolutionary change encouraging for betterment of crop and animal health without affecting the environment. Nanotechnology bears tremendous potential to effectively integrate manifold activities of agriculture practices with sustainable productivity. Although the potential benefits of nanotechnology are countless, the environmental safety concerns needs to be cautiously examined. Nanotechnology improves their performance and adequacy by increasing viability, security and, eventually, lowering social insurance costs. In this review, we highlight the nanotechnological interventions aiming towards sustainability in agricultural and food processing sectors primarily by deploying modified nanoparticles and also emphasized several challenges and their impact on the environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: S.K.

Genetic and environmental factors are believed to be responsible for neuronal diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. It is difficult to restore normal nervous function after neurodegeneration; hence, prevention could be the best strategy against these diseases. Ayurved medicines such as Suvarna Bhasma (SB) have enormous potential to treat these neurological diseases. Aim: The aim of this study is to examine the protective effect of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish. Materials and methods: In this study, we induced Parkinson's-like disease model in zebrafish by inducing it with rotenone (7 μg/L). We examined the behavioural, proteomics and dopamine alterations of rotenone induced zebrafish of SB pre-treated group as compared to the control group. Results: The behavioural experiments showed that due to rotenone exposure, Parkinson's-like behavioural abnormality was induced in zebrafish. However, because of SB treatment, this behavioural abnormality was reduced. The proteomics study of zebrafish brains clearly showed that the SB-treated group was not significantly affected due to rotenone exposure. However, in the SB non-treated group, expression of nine proteins that are linked to Parkinson's disease (gene name: sncgb, ywhae1, ywhah, uchl1, ywhaba, psma6a, ywhabl, ywhaqb, and ywhabb) were differentially expressed after rotenone exposure. Finally, prevention of dopamine alteration in SB-treated fish brains confirmed the protective action of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish.

However, investigation of its toxic effects on offspring after parental exposure has been neglected, especially for aquatic organisms such as fish. In the current study, the effects of chronic CPF exposure (3 and 60 μg/L) on adult zebrafish (F0) was investigated to determine its influence on adult reproductive capacity and offspring (F1 and F2). The results showed the existence of CPF both in F0 ovaries and F1 embryos and larvae, indicating that CPF could be transferred directly from the F0 adult fish to F1 offspring. After 90 d exposure, we observed that F0 female fish showed increased proportion of perinucleolar oocyte in the ovaries, decreased proportion of mature oocyte, and decreased egg production, but not in F1 adult. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that the disruption of metabolism during oocyte maturation in the CPF treatment zebrafish might interfere with F0 oocytes development and quality and ultimately influence offspring survival. For the larvae, the parental CPF exposure distinctly inhibited heart rate at 72 and 120 hpf and increased the mortality of F1 but not F2 larvae. The changes of biochemical indicators confirmed a disturbance in the oxidative balance, induced inflammatory reaction and apoptosis in F1 larvae. Furthermore, the changing profiles of mRNA revealed by RNA-seq confirmed an increased susceptibility in F1 larvae and figured out potential disruptions of ROS metabolism, immune system, apoptosis, and metabolism pathways.

Accurate identification of the fish pathogenic Edwardsiella species is crucial for preventing disease spread and providing effective treatment strategies in the aquaculture industry. These species have high phenotypic and genetic similarities (> 99% in 16S rRNA sequences), which makes their differentiation challenging. In this study, we developed a multiplex real-time PCR diagnostic assay based on the single-copy DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB) gene using a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe to discriminate among four fish pathogenic Edwardsiella species, E. tarda, E. piscicida, E. anguillarum, and E. ictaluri. Through phylogenetic analysis based on gyrB sequences (1462 bp), 57 Korean Edwardsiella isolates were affiliated to E. piscicida, E. anguillarum, and E. tarda, accounting for host and geographical origin specificity. The assay targeted a conserved region in gyrB, and designed four probes, each capable of distinguishing among the four Edwardsiella species, even in cases of 1–3 nucleotide mismatch, based on differences in melting temperature. The assay exhibited high specificity and sensitivity, with reaction efficiency in the range 85–100% and a reliable quantifiable limit of 102 copies per reaction for all fluorescence signals. In addition, it could detect and quantify the four species, even in mixed infections, allowing accurate identification within 2 h in a single reaction.

Thus, lacking the fate-pathway perspective in defining pesticide environmental quality standards might cause undesirable pesticide residue from the upper compartment (e.g., soil) to the lower compartment (e.g., water). This study aimed to harmonize the self-consistency of pesticide environmental quality standards across environmental media via the fate-pathway analysis. The introduced qualitative and quantitative rules defined environmental quality standards of pesticides in six major environmental scenarios in the soil and water system based on related regulatory objectives. Fate factors simulated via USEtox were used to create a preliminary quantitative link between theoretical maximum legal masses of pesticides across environmental compartments. Using chlorpyrifos and 2,4-D as examples, their standard values were comparatively assessed in selected environmental media in China and the United States. According to the investigative findings, missing the respective environmental quality standards of pesticides in the agricultural soil could significantly influence the implementation of those in freshwater. Taking a fate-pathway perspective, the self-consistency test highlighted that defining pesticide environmental quality standards for freshwater was the most challenging task, as the freshwater compartment typically comprises multiple lower environmental compartments with diverse regulatory objectives. Overall, this theoretical study has the potential to illuminate the harmonization of pesticide environmental quality standards throughout the entire environmental fate pathway, ultimately leading to improved regulatory efficiency and communication. Future research should focus on risk-based model implementation, regulatory response evaluation, and legal limit interpretation to better integrate environmental pesticide management under a variety of regulatory goals. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: Z.

Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, i.e. folpet in soil, water and air. It should be noted that for surface water no enforcement method is needed for the determination of folpet, due to the fact that the DT90 value is below 3 d (the trigger value given in SANCO/825/00). For food of plant origin no validated analytical methods for monitoring purposes are available.        Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. However, due to some outstanding data no final specification can be proposed for the technical material at the moment.        Folpet has a low acute oral and dermal toxicity but it is R20 'Harmful by Inhalation'. It is not irritating to the skin but it is severely irritating to eyes (proposal for classification as R41 ""Risk of serious damage to eyes"") and is a skin sensitiser (R43 'May cause sensitisation by skin contact' is proposed). Folpet does not show any genotoxic potential in vivo but it is carcinogenic in the mouse (category 3, R 40 proposed for the classification by the majority of the experts), with a clear threshold identified. Folpet did not cause adverse effects on adult fertility or reproduction in rats over two generations, but was shown to be teratogenic in rabbits (classification as R63 is still under discussion and is forwarded to ECB). The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.2 mg/kg bw. The operator estimated exposure accounts for 34 to 77% of the AOEL in outdoor scenarios (German model with PPE considered). Estimates provided for operator exposure in glass-houses ranged from 29% to 33% of the AOEL (PPE is worn). The exposure of bystanders is 1.6% of the AOEL. Worker exposure in harvesting grapes and tomatoes without protective gloves is 133% and 68% of the AOEL, with PPE such as gloves it is assumed that the exposure is below the AOEL. Worker exposure following applications of folpet to wheat can be expected to be lower than following applications to grapes or tomatoes.        The metabolism of folpet in plants has been adequately elucidated. The main degradation products after release of the trichloromethylthio-side chain are phthalimide and phthalic acid. As it is not possible at this stage to fully characterize the toxicological properties of phthalimide, this metabolite needs to be included in the residue definition for plant products for monitoring and risk assessment purposes. Supervised residue trials were carried out in most cases with analysis of folpet only and therefore it is not possible to establish MRLs and to conduct an exposure assessment covering the contribution of phthalimide to the residue. However, taking into account folpet only, an acute risk for toddlers consuming treated table grapes has been identified. Specific studies allowing a clear understanding of the behaviour of the compound during processing are not available. The drastic reduction of folpet level in processed commodities and the physico-chemical properties of the compound suggest that important amounts of phthalimide and/or phthalic acid could be produced during processing. No residue of folpet and related metabolites are expected in rotational crops and in animal commodities.        Folpet is very low or low persistent in soil. First degradation step involves the release of the highly reactive thiophosgene to yield the major soil metabolite phthalimide which is further degraded through phthalamic acid to phthalic acid. All major folpet metabolites are also very low or low persistent in soil under aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. Mineralization is high and unextractable residues are formed in moderate amounts (max. 31.2 % AR at 14 d).        In relation to the thiophosgene moiety, further information was derived from captan. The experts' meeting agreed that it is not expected that free thiophosgene will reach significant levels due to the degradation of folpet in soil. Under anaerobic conditions folpet degraded slightly slower and no new metabolites were identified.        Photolysis does not contribute significantly to the environmental dissipation of folpet.        PEC soil presented in the DAR were based on worst case laboratory half life (DT50 = 4.3 d) with the critical GAP of ten applications of 1.5 kg a.s / ha at 7 days interval (grapes use). In the addendum March 2005 PEC soil are recalculated for all three uses taking into account crop interception given for FOCUS GW. However, EFSA considers that this calculation is not adequate for vines (were interception factor has been averaged) and needs to be further justified for tomatoes. New PEC soil values calculated by EFSA were used in the risk assessment for earthworms presented in the conclusion. Due to ambiguities with respect to the time of application interception for PEC soil, calculation cannot be established for wheat.        Folpet was estimated (based on physical chemical properties or theoretical calculations) to be medium mobile (K-oc = 304 mL / g), phtalamic acid very high mobile (Koc = 10 mL / g) and phthalic acid high mobile (K-oc = 73 mL / g) in soil. Phthalimide was experimentally found to be medium to high mobile in soil (K-foc = 72 - 385 mL / g).        Hydrolysis of folpet is rapid at acidic and neutral pH (DT50 < 3 h) and very rapid at alkaline pH (DT50 < 3 min). Main hydrolysis metabolites were phathalimide and phthalic acid. Trichlomethylsulfenic acid and tricloromethylmercaptan are postulated to be the two major non characterized hydrolysis metabolites of folpet. These metabolites will degrade to thiophosgene, carbon oxysulfide and ultimately to CO2. Phthalimide was stable at 25 degrees C and pHs 4 and 7 and at pH 9 was hydrolysed with a half life of 2 h. Contribution of photolysis to the aqueous degradation of folpet was not significant. Folpet was shown to be readily biodegradable at concentrations of 1 mg C/L.        In the water sediment systems folpet degrades very rapidly and mineralization is relatively high. Folpet is not found in the sediment phase. Major metabolites in the water phase were phthalimide, phthalamic acid, phthalic acid, benzamide and 2-cyanobenzoic acid. No major metabolite was found in the sediment phase. All the metabolites degraded rapidly in both systems (DT50 < 7 d).        After the Experts' meeting new PECsw calculations have been presented based on FOCUS scheme. Whereas not peer reviewed, EFSA can confirm that the parameters already agreed by the experts' meeting have been used in this calculation. Values obtained for the different representative uses are lower than the worst case runoff estimation presented in the DAR (577 mu g/L). This level could be of concern only for metabolite phthalimide. Therefore, FOCUS STEP 1 values have been used to complete the assessment of this metabolite (See 5.2.). FOCUS sw calculations for the parent up to STEP 4 are also summarized in the addendum of October 2005, these calculations have not been peer reviewed and have not been used for the EU risk assessment.        The acute risk to birds was assessed as low in a first tier risk assessment for all representative uses. The short-term and long-term TER values for herbivorous birds were below the Annex VI triggers of 10 and 5. But since the TER value of >8.9 is based on a NOEC from the highest tested dose and tomato foliage is considered not to be an attractive food source, the risk to herbivorous birds is assumed to be low for the representative use in tomatoes A high long term risk to insectivorous birds was identified in a first tier risk assessment for all representative uses. The refined risk assessment for birds was discussed in the EPCO expert meeting. It was agreed that the risk assessment should not be based on the highest observed NOEC of 769 mg a.s./kg/d and that the RUD refinement would not cover the risk from uptake of residues in small insects. On the basis of the peer reviewed data a high long-term risk to insectivorous birds cannot be excluded. The risk to mammals is low for the representative uses in winter wheat and tomatoes but a high acute and long term risk to small herbivorous mammals cannot be excluded for the representative use in grapes. The first tier risk assessment for the uptake of contaminated drinking water resulted in a high acute risk for birds and mammals if the solution is sprayed at the highest recommended concentration. The risk of secondary poisoning of birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated earthworms and fish is considered to be low for all representative uses. The intrinsic toxicity of folpet to fish and daphnids is high. Due to very rapid degradation the toxicity under static conditions is markedly lower. The acute risk to fish and daphnids is high and risk mitigation measures such as no spray buffer buffer zones of 5 m for the use in winter wheat and tomatoes and 10 m for the use in grapes are required. A long-term risk assessment for aquatic organisms is required since the representative uses cover multiple applications leading to repeated exposure. The long-term risk to fish is high and risk mitigation measures such as no spray buffer zones of 5 m and 15 m are required to for the representative uses in winter wheat, tomatoes and grapes, respectively. The available data do not allow drawing a conclusion on the long-term risk to aquatic invertebrates. The endpoints from a flow through study would lead to an overestimation of the long-term risk to daphnids. The risk of bioaccumulation and the risk from major metabolites posed to aquatic organisms are considered to be low. The risk to earthworms is low for the use in tomatoes but a high risk to earthworms cannot be excluded for the uses in grapes. The risk to earthworms from the use in winter wheat cannot be concluded until a reliable PEC soil is established.        The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, other soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms, other non-target organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

rayyan-1227191409,Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance malathion,2009,7,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,7,,EFSA,,English,,,"Malathion is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20002, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on malathion in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 2 February 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 16 April 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Cheminova A/S. There was also another notifier (Cequisa) according to Commission Regulation (EC) No. 703/20014 but it was not possible to reach an agreement and to provide a collective dossier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January -March 2005.        A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 30 November 2005 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 13 January 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 63)        Following the Commission Decision of 6 June 2007 (2007/389/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of malathion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant, Cheminova A/S made a resubmission application for the inclusion of malathion in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No.33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report (European Commission, 2007) as follows:        the presence in the technical material of isomalathion, the genotoxicity of which cannot be excluded, the consumer exposure the long term risk to mammals and concerns were identified with regard to: the exposure of operators, workers and bystanders which cannot be concluded due to the presence of isomalathion in the technical material the acute and chronic risk for consumers, due to the insufficient information on the effects of certain toxicologically relevant metabolites the high risk to aquatic organisms, honey bees and non-target arthropods.        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, The United Kingdom, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on malathion in the format of an Additional Report (The United Kingdom, 2009a). The Additional Report was received by EFSA on 11 February 2009. In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 13 February 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 17 March 2009. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission decided to further consult the EFSA. By written request, received by the EFSA on 24 April 2009, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange a peer review of the Additional Report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days.        The peer review commenced with EFSA's consideration of the Reporting Table containing the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS' evaluation of the comments and response. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase were further considered in a series of scientific meetings and a telephone conference with Member State experts in June 2009.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in June 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been reissued to update the risk assessment in all areas.        The original conclusion from the review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as acaricide and insecticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprised foliar spraying to control various harmful organisms in apples, strawberries, alfalfa and ornamentals at application rate up 1.8 kg malathion per hectare. The uses on apple and alfalfa were no longer supported in the resubmission application, and therefore the conclusion has only been updated in relation to the risk assessment of the representative uses presented in the Additional Report, i.e. only the use in strawberries and ornamentals at application rates of maximum 1.2 kg and 0.114 kg malathion per hectare respectively.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'CHA 3110' (` Fyfanon 440'), an oil in water emulsion (EW), registered under different trade names in some EU Member States.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions, however a data gap was identified concerning amendments to the description of the sample preparation for the method for residues in plants. In case of food of plant origin, malathion and malaoxon7 can also be determined by a multi-residue method. No method for the determination of malathion in food of animal origin is required for the representative uses of the resubmission. In the case of soil and surface water no enforcement method for the determination of malathion is needed due to the fact that the DT90 values are lower than 3 days.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        The concentration of isomalathion8 in the batches of technical malathion tested in the toxicological studies is lower than in the specification (between 0.018%-0.44%, if mentioned at all, of the current specification.) The currently supported specification of malathion allows a maximum concentration of 0.2 % (w/w) isomalathion in the technical active substance and according to the FAO specification, it is 0.4 % (w/w).        Based on the available studies in the toxicological data package, only the 0.03% isomalathion content can be said to be covered. As for the level of 0.2% isomalathion, an additional safety factor of 10 was added at the EPCO meeting to the ADI and the AOEL in order to be able to conclude on the risk assessment due to uncertainties in studies relevant for the setting of reference values.        The level of isomalathion in the current 5-batch analysis showed a mean content of 0.0480.076%. This implied that the limit of 0.03% regarding the toxicological data package would not be feasible. Thus, the toxicological assumptions had to be based on the 0.2% limit. Furthermore, it is shown in the FAO specification that the amount of isomalathion even increases during storage both in relation to time and temperature by a factor of 2-10. Thus, the reference values had to be based on the 0.2% level.        Malathion is rapidly absorbed and excreted. There is no evidence of accumulation. The highest concentration was found in the liver, followed by skin, fat, bone and gastrointestinal tract. The metabolites excreted in urine and faeces were primarily the mono (MMCA9) and dicarboxylic (MDCA10) acids of malathion. Malathion is moderately toxic by the oral route in rat (a classification as Xn; R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" is proposed). Malathion is not acutely toxic via the dermal route or through inhalation; it is not irritant to skin and eyes but it is a skin sensitizer (Xi; R43 ""The cause sensitisation by skin contact"" is proposed). The target uncertainties in the provisional risk assessment presented in this document, the margin of safety between the currently estimated consumer exposure and the allocated toxicological reference values is considered sufficiently big with respect to the notified use of malathion in strawberries.        The available data demonstrate that in soil malathion degrades to the major (> 10% applied radioactivity) metabolites malathion monocarboxylic acid (MMCA) and malathion dicarboxylic acid (MDCA). Mineralization of the a carbon radiolabels in each ester moiety accounted for 50-67% AR after 92-162 days incubation at 20-22 degrees C. The values for residues not extracted by acidified acetonitrile: water followed by methylenene chloride and a methanol Soxhlet extraction or 1N hydrochloric acid followed by acidified acetonitrile and an acetone Soxhlet extraction were 26-41% AR after 92-120 days. In soil malathion and MMCA exhibited very low persistence and MDCA exhibited low persistence.        In guideline batch soil adsorption studies malathion exhibited medium mobility. There was no evidence of pH dependant adsorption. MDCA exhibited very high to high mobility with adsorption being pH dependent with lower adsorption at higher soil pH. The adsorption of MMCA could not be measured in batch adsorption studies due to its very rapid degradation. However it is considered it will have high to very high mobility depending on soil pH, based on extrapolation of the results from MDCA.        In sediment water systems malathion exhibited very low persistence breaking down to the major metabolites MMCA (which exhibited low persistence) and MDCA (which exhibited medium persistence). All the compounds remained primarily in the water phase of the test sediment water systems. Mineralization of the a carbon radiolabels in each ester moiety accounted for 58-69 % AR after 120 days at 20 degrees C. Residues not extracted from sediment by acidified acetonitrile followed by Soxhlet extraction with acetone were also a sink for radioactivity representing 25-36% AR at 120 days. Levels of extractable radioactivity in sediment were relatively low (< 15% AR) at all sampling times. MDCA was the largest proportion of this sediment extractable radioactivity but it accounted for a maximum of only 7.5% AR.        For the representative use on strawberry appropriate aquatic exposure assessment in accordance with FOCUS 2001 surface water guidance is available for malathion and its metabolites MMCA and MDCA. In addition for malathion spray drift mitigation was implemented in aquatic exposure assessments in accordance with FOCUS 2007 landscape and mitigation guidance. This assessment has been demonstrated to encompass the exposure expected from the use assessed on glasshouse ornamentals, when a Dutch procedure for estimating emissions from glasshouses to surface water is followed.        The available FOCUS groundwater modelling indicates that the potential for groundwater contamination as a consequence of the applied for representative uses (both in the original application and in the resubmission application) for malathion and its major soil metabolites MMCA and MDCA is minimal. (This may not be the case for other field uses especially if applications are possible over the late autumn and winter period. The available modelling indicated that in this situation contamination of vulnerable shallow groundwater by MDCA might be expected).        Data were not available to conclude on the acute and long-term risk to insectivorous birds following application in strawberries. The risk is however considered low for all mammals and frugivorous birds. Based on the data available, malathion was considered to be very toxicto aquatic organisms. Acute toxicity to fish and toxicity to invertebrates was driving the aquatic risk assessment for use in strawberries. Based on FOCUSsw Step 4 exposure data including maximum mitigation measures the risk was considered low in three out of four scenarios. The toxicity to bees was identified as high and risk mitigation measures should be set at Member State level. No risk mitigations measures were needed to protect other nontarget arthropods off field. The risk of malathion to earthworms, other soil macro- and microorganisms, non-target flora and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low. However, a data gap was defined to address the potential risk to earthworms for the enantiomer forms of the metabolite MDCA.

rayyan-1227191410,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance quizalofop-P (considered variants quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl) Issued on 26 November 2008,2009,7,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,7,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Quizalofop-P is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002.(1) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted a DAR on the variant quizalofop-Pethyl and a DAR on the variant quizalofop-P-tefuryl in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which were received by the EFSA on 1 February 2007 and 2 May 2007 respectively. The peer review was initiated on 24 October 2007 by dispatching the DARs for consultation of the Member States and the respective notifiers Nissan Chemical Europe SARL and Chemtura Europe Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DARs were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting tables. These tables were evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in October 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of quizalofop-Pethyl as a herbicide on sugar beet and quizalofop-P-tefuryl as a herbicide on oilseed rape, sugar/fodder beet, potato, combining pea, field beans, linseed and sunflower. Full details of the good agricultural practice (GAP) can be found in the attached list of endpoints.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation of quizalofop-P-ethyl was 'Targa Super', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). For quizalofop-P-tefuryl the representative formulation was 'Panarex' (also known as 'Pantera'), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC).        For food of plant and animal origin none of the methods supplied comply with the residue definition. For environmental matrices sufficient methods are available. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. The specification for the ethyl variant was not accepted as further justification is required. Data gaps for surface tension and persistent foam were identified. For the tefuryl variant the specification was acceptable for section 1, although there is an outstanding question on the formation of the isomeric impurity of quizalofop. A data gap was identified for a method of analysis to separate the R and S isomers (note this is not the R and S isomers in the tefuryl part of the molecule). A data gap was also identified for kinematic viscosity for aspiration hazard classification.        Quizalofop-P-tefuryl tested in mammalian toxicology is ""Harmful if swallowed"" (Xn; R22 proposed based on oral Lethal Dose - LD50 1012 mg/kg bw); it has low dermal and inhalation toxicity (LD50 >2000 mg/kg bw and Lethal Concentration - LC50 >3.9 mg/L air, respectively). Quizalofop-P-tefuryl is not a skin or eye irritant, but it is a skin sensitiser in Magnusson-Kligman test (Xn; R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" was proposed). Short-term toxicity target organs were liver and testes. In rodents, the relevant No Observed Adverse Effect Level - NOAEL (rat study) was 1.7 mg/kg bw/day based on increased liver weights, accentuated lobulation of the liver and haematological and clinical chemistry findings at 33.4 mg/kg bw/day. Kidney, testis and body weights were decreased at 134 mg/kg bw/day. Quizalofop-P-tefuryl did not show genotoxic concern. In long-term toxicity studies the relevant NOAEL is 1.3 mg/kg bw/day. Quizalofop-P-tefuryl caused an increased incidence of rare renal squamous cell carcinoma, as well as a clear treatment related increase in the Leydig cell tumours in rats; the liver tumours occurring in rodents were not relevant to humans. On this basis Carc Cat, 3; R40 ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"" was proposed. In the two-generation rat study, the NOAEL for parental and offspring was 1.4 mg/kg bw/day based on increased liver weight and liver hypertrophy in adult males and females, vacuolar changes in pituitary in adult males, decreased body weights during lactation in F1 generation and decreased viability during early lactation. The NOAEL for reproduction was 16.9 mg/kg bw/day. In developmental toxicity studies in rats the maternal NOAEL was set at 10 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the developmental NOAEL was 30 mg/kg bw/day based on increased postimplantation loss per dam with concomitant lower number of viable foetuses and increased number of malformations at maternally toxic dose. In rabbits, the NOAEL was 20 mg/kg bw/day for maternal and developmental toxicity. However, the rabbit was not adequately tested but this was considered not to preclude concluding on the risk assessment. Due to the limitations of the studies, Repr. Cat. 3; R63? (""Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"") was agreed for proposal to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.013 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL of the 2-year study in rats, SF 100.        The NOAEL of 1.7 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day rat study was the most relevant NOAEL, also based on its dosing regime, and applying a 60% correction factor (limited oral absorption) and SF 100 resulted in an Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) of 0.1 mg/kg bw was based on the maternal toxicity seen in the rat developmental study with a SF 100 applied. The estimated operator exposure exceeded the AOEL without the use of PPE, as well as with PPE but only with the UK POEM. The exposure was estimated below the AOEL (13%) applying the German model, with the use of gloves during mixing/loading and application and coverall and sturdy footwear during application. The exposure for workers re-entering the field for crop inspection and the bystander estimated exposure were estimated to be below the AOEL (for workers re-entering in ornamentals the use of gloves is needed).        Quizalofop-P-ethyl is ""Harmful if swallowed"" (Xn; R22 proposed based on oral LD50 1182 mg/kg bw); dermal and inhalation acute toxicity is low (LD50 >5000 mg/kg bw and LC50 5.8 mg/L air, respectively). Quizalofop-P-ethyl is not a skin or eye irritant, nor does it show any sensitisation potential. Target organ in repeat dose studies was shown to be the liver. The lowest short-term NOAEL for quizalofop-P-ethyl is 1.7 mg/kg bw/day in mice study after 13-week (90-day) dietary administration, whereas the relevant long- term NOAEL is 0.9 mg/kg bw/day (2-year study in rats). Quizalofop-P-ethyl did not exhibit genotoxic or carcinogenic properties relevant to humans. It is not a reproductive or developmental toxicant: the NOAEL for offspring is 2.4 mg/kg bw/day based on hepatoxicity; the parental NOAEL is 9.4 mg/kg bw/day based on slightly decreased body weight during premating period, whereas the reproductive NOAEL is 37.8 mg/kg bw/day, highest dose tested. The maternal and developmental NOAEL in rats is 30 mg/kg bw/day based on decreased body weight gain and food consumption, increased resorptions and skeletal variations at >= 100 mg/kg bw/day. In rabbits, no malformations were observed up to doses of 60 mg/kg bw/day, which represented the NOAEL for developmental toxicity, whereas the maternal NOAEL for dams was 30 mg/kg bw/day based on slightly decreased body weight and food consumption and decreased thymus and thyroid weights at 60 mg/kg bw/day. Quizalofop-P-ethyl does not have a potential to induce neurotoxicity in mammals. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.009 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-yr rat study with an SF 100; The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 90-day mouse study with an SF 100 (corrected for limited oral absorption of 67%). Due to the toxicological profile of quizalofop-P-ethyl, the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not triggered. The operator exposure assessment was estimated to be below the AOEL (26%) with the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE, with the German model). The exposure for workers re-entering field for crop inspection and the bystander estimated exposure were estimated to be below the AOEL (for workers the use of gloves is needed).        For both quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl, the metabolism in plants was investigated in potato, cotton and soya; the ethyl variant was additionally investigated in sugar beet. For quizalofop-P-tefuryl, one radioactive label was investigated and considering the insufficient metabolite characterisation in some studies, the meeting concluded that new studies labelled in a second position need to be provided. For both variants, the metabolism proceeds primarily by the hydrolysis of the ester link to yield quizalofop (acid) followed by the loss of the propionyl moiety leading to the quizalofop-phenol metabolite. Further metabolism occurs by hydroxylation of the quinoxaline moiety giving the hydroxy-quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop-phenol and the dihydroxy-quizalofop-phenol. In addition, the presence of the quinoxaline and phenoxy metabolites indicated a cleavage of the parent molecule. Parts of these different metabolites were also found as conjugates.        The meeting discussed whether the phenoxy propionate and hydroxy-quizalofop-phenol metabolites which were observed in beet foliage and soya meal in similar amounts to the tefuryl ester or to quizalofop, have to be included in the plant residue definition and if they have to be taken into account in the animal feeding. Finally and provisionally, the experts decided not to include these compounds in the residue definition, awaiting a statement on their toxicological relevance, and proposed the following residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment for each individual ester variant:        ""Sum of quizalofop-ester, quizalofop and quizalofop conjugates expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers)""        Considering the metabolism studies performed with the three quizalofop ester variants, a common residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was also proposed for propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl as:        ""Sum of quizalofop-esters, quizalofop and quizalofop conjugates expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers)""        These definitions should remain provisional, pending the submission and the evaluation of the requested additional information. After the meeting and considering that conjugates were mainly detected in immature soya and cotton plants, the EFSA proposed not to include these conjugates in the residue definitions, especially for monitoring since the ethyl variant, tefuryl variant and quizalofop seem to be sufficient markers for the residues in plants.        In addition for quizalofop-P-ethyl, the meeting was of the opinion that the metabolism pattern has not been sufficiently described in root crops. No characterisations were performed in potato tubers and a substantial part of the extracted radioactivity was not identified in the sugar beet. Therefore, it was concluded that these studies were not sufficient to validate the proposed residue definition on the root/tuber plant group, especially on potato. However, and considering that no metabolites are expected at significant levels in sugar beet root, it was agreed that the proposed residue definition could be applied to beet root. The notifier was requested to provide further information concerning the unidentified fractions observed in the beet studies, unless a new metabolism study has to be submitted for tuber/root crops.        For quizalofop-P-ethyl, supervised residue trials were submitted to support a single representative use on sugar beet only. The trials performed with the highest LOQ of 0.10 mg/kg were removed from the data set and a MRL of 0.05 mg/kg was proposed for sugar beet roots. For quizalofop-P-tefuryl, a sufficient number of residue trials were submitted to propose MRLs on potato, sugar beet, bean, pea, lentil, oilseed rape, linseed, soya and sunflower. Samples were analysed using a method quantifying separately the parent quizalofop-P-tefuryl and its free and conjugated metabolites (including quizalofop) which can be converted to 2-methoxy-6-chloroquinoxaline, but this method was only validated for the tefuryl variant and quizalofop. This method was considered as appropriate in the framework of this peer review since its scope is wider than the compounds included in the proposed residue definition.        The storage stability study showed that quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop residues are stable for at least 16 months in beet matrices. However, an additional study on oil/protein matrices was requested in order to support the results of the rotational crop study. Quizalofop-P-tefuryl and quizalofop residues were shown to be stable up to 12 - 24 months in a wider range of plant matrices (soya beans, cotton seeds, rape seed oil and cake, potato tubers). A degradation from the ester quizalofop-P-tefuryl to quizalofop was observed in beet matrices after one month, but generally recoveries were more than 80% when both quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop residues were added up. Clarifications were requested concerning the different analytical methods used in these storage stability studies and especially concerning the validation for ""bound residues"".        No processing study was provided for quizalofop-P-ethyl as no residues were detected in beet roots following the use of the active substance as stated in the critical GAP. For quizalofop-P-tefuryl, a standard hydrolytic study was provided but for the boiling condition only and a new study covering the full range of the processing conditions was requested. No processing factors could be derived from the rapeseed study since the residues detected in all processed fractions (crude oil, refined oil, pressed cake etc.) were considered to be not consistent with the initial levels observed in seeds. A new processing study was requested, unless clarifications could be provided. On potatoes, the residue levels were not affected in boiled potatoes but were increased in fried potatoes.        The compounds detected in the rotational crops studies performed with quizalofop-ethyl (racemate) and quizalofop-P-tefuryl were also present in the primary crops, suggesting a similar metabolic pathway in both primary and rotational crops. Considering the residue levels observed in these studies, it was concluded that no significant residues of quizalofop-ethyl, quizalofop-P-tefuryl and of their metabolites are expected in rotational crops.        The metabolism in animals was investigated using the racemate quizalofop-ethyl labelled on the phenyl and quinoxaline moieties in the goat study but only on the quinoxaline moiety in the hen study. This single radio-labelling was considered as sufficient in the scope of this peer review, since the intended use on sugar beet does not lead to significant intake by poultry. For quizalofop-P-tefuryl, the metabolism studies on goat and hen were conducted using a single label only. Considering that the characterisation/identification of the metabolites was insufficiently investigated in some animal matrices, a new study using a second labelling position was requested. Similar metabolic pathways were observed for both ester variants, starting with rapid hydrolysis of the ester bond leading to the acid quizalofop and followed by hydroxylation or further hydrolysis giving the hydroxy-quizalofop and hydroxy-quizalofop-phenol, these metabolites being subject to conjugation. In the hen study, quizalofop-pentanoic acid was also observed as a major metabolite in liver and kidney. The very low proportion of quinoxaline metabolites (<1% TRR) indicated limited cleavage of the parent molecule. Considering the comparative metabolite distribution in rat and goat for quizalofop-P-ethyl, the experts discussed whether a supplementary metabolism study in pig should be requested. The metabolism in rat and ruminants was similar qualitatively but differences were observed quantitatively. Higher residues were detected in rat on an equivalent mg/kg bw basis, some differences being of a 10-fold magnitude. Before asking for a pig metabolism study, it was suggested to ask the notifiers to provide explanations for these quantitative differences. No comparison was possible for quizalofop-P-tefuryl since the dosages of the metabolites in rat and goat were performed at different time points. Finally and provisionally the meeting of experts proposed the following residue definitions for each individual variant:        For monitoring: sum of quizalofop-ester and quizalofop expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers).        For risk assessment: sum of quizalofop-ester, quizalofop pentanoic acid and quizalofop, expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers).        Considering the metabolism studies performed with the three ester variants, the meeting of experts concluded that the following common residue definitions can be proposed for propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl:        For monitoring: sum of quizalofop-esters and quizalofop expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers).        For risk assessment: sum of quizalofop-esters, quizalofop pentanoic acid and quizalofop, expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers).        These definitions should remain provisional, pending submission and the evaluation of the requested additional information and the statement on the toxicological relevance of some metabolites.        No feeding studies were submitted for quizalofop-P-ethyl and considering the metabolism studies performed with an exaggerated dose rate, it was concluded that no significant residues are expected in animal matrices resulting from the use of quizalofop-P-ethyl on sugar beet. Feeding studies in cow and hen were submitted for quizalofop-P-tefuryl. Taking into account the transfer in animal products and the theoretical animal burden resulting from the representative uses of quizalofop-P-tefuryl, residue levels above the LOQs are expected in ruminant kidney and in poultry liver, kidney and fat. MRLs were proposed for these animal products. The stability of the residues in products of animal origin was however considered as insufficiently demonstrated and the notifier was asked to provide new data.        Using the EFSA consumer model and considering the representative use of quizalofop-P-ethyl on sugar beet, no chronic concern was observed, the theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) being less than 13% of the ADI (0.009 mg/kg bw/d). Considering the MRLs proposed for plant and animal products, no chronic and acute concerns were observed for quizalofop-P-tefuryl, the maximum TMDI using the EFSA model being 23% of the ADI (0.013 mg/kg bw/d) and the maximum international estimated short-term intake (IESTI), 31% of the ARfD (0.1 mg/kg bw/d).        Awaiting the additional information/ clarification requested during the peer review process, provisional MRLs were proposed for sugar beet, potato, bean and pea (without pods), lentils, soybeans, oil seed rape and sunflower. MRLs were also proposed for products of animal origin, based on the quizalofop-P-tefuryl representative uses.        In the environmental fate and behaviour section, the data sets for the common metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop and dihydroxy-quinoxaline available in the DARs of propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl were combined in order to derive a single set of endpoints (amalgamated list of endpoints) for the fate properties of each metabolite to use in the environmental exposure assessment.        In soil under aerobic conditions quizalofop-P-tefuryl exhibits very low persistence forming the major soil metabolites quizalofop (accounting for up to 101.5% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to high persistence, hydroxy-quizalofop (accounting for up to 21% AR) which exhibits low to medium persistence, dihydroxy-quinoxaline (accounting for up to 18% AR) which exhibits moderate to high persistence, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (accounting for up to 59% AR) which exhibits very low persistence. The metabolite tetrahydrofuroic acid (up to 9.3% AR) was present at levels that trigger a groundwater exposure assessment. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring, the furfuryl group or the quinoxaline group to carbon dioxide accounted for 2.3 - 70% AR after 30 - 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 15 - 50% AR after 30 - 120 days. Due to the rapid degradation of quizalofop-P-tefuryl in soil under aerobic conditions, batch equilibrium studies with the parent compound were not performed. A worst case value of 0 mL/g and 1/n = 1 was selected for use in FOCUS scenario calculations of groundwater exposure potential. Quizalofop and hydroxy-quizalofop exhibit low to high mobility in soil, and dihydroxyquinoxaline exhibits low to very high mobility in soil. There was no indication in the available data that adsorption of either quizalofop-P-tefuryl or its identified soil metabolites is pH dependent.        In dark natural sediment water systems quizalofop-P-tefuryl degraded very rapidly to the metabolites quizalofop (max. 94% AR in water and max. 53% AR in the sediment) tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (max. 16.5% AR in the water), tetrahydrofuroic acid (max. 39.1% AR in the water), CQOP (max. 11.6% in the sediment) and dihydroxy-quinoxaline (max. 16.4% AR in the sediment). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for quizalofop-P-tefuryl. After the peer review for metabolites quizalofop and hydroxy-quizalofop, the EFSA performed new FOCUS SW calculations at Steps 1 and 2 using the endpoints agreed in the amalgamated list of endpoints. The recalculated initial predicted environmental concentration in surface water (PECsw) was used in the toxicity exposure ratio (TER) calculations for these two metabolites. For metabolites CQOP, dihydroxy-quinoxaline, tetrahydrofuroic acid and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol no reliable PECsw and predicted environmental concentration in sediment (PECsed) were available. However, as the risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to CQOP, dihydroxy-quinoxaline, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol is assessed to be low when the initial PEC values for quizalofop are used, no further assessment is required for these metabolites. No recalculations for tetrahydrofuroic acid were necessary. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by quizalofop-P-tefuryl and its metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop, dihydroxy-quinoxaline, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and tetrahydrofuroic acid above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        In soil under aerobic conditions quizalofop-P-ethyl exhibits low to very low persistence, forming the major soil metabolites quizalofop (accounting for up to 84% AR) which exhibits low to high persistence, metabolite hydroxy-quizalofop accounting for up to 16% AR which exhibits low to medium persistence, and metabolite dihydroxy-quinoxaline accounting for up to 12% AR which exhibits moderate to high persistence. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring or the quinoxaline group to carbon dioxide accounted for 1.8 - 32% AR after 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 23 - 42% AR after 120 days. Quizalofop-P-ethyl exhibits low to slight mobility in soil. Quizalofop and hydroxy-quizalofop exhibit low to high mobility in soil, and dihydroxy-quinoxaline exhibits low to very high mobility in soil. There was no indication in the available data that adsorption of either quizalofop-P-tefuryl or its identified soil metabolites was pH dependent. In dark natural water/sediment systems quizalofop-P-ethyl degraded very rapidly to the metabolite quizalofop (max. 83% AR in water and max. 43% AR in the sediment). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach with Steps 1 and 2 for quizalofop-P-tefuryl, quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop and dihydroxy-quinoxaline. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by quizalofop-P-ethyl and its metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop, and dihydroxy-quinoxaline above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        Aquatic and terrestrial ecotoxicological endpoints for the common metabolites of propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl were assessed by Member State experts. Where more than one study was available for the same metabolite in the dossiers for propaquizafop, quizalofop-Pethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl, the lower valid endpoint was agreed to be used in all relevant risk assessments.        The acute, short-term and long-term risk to birds from quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl was assessed as low for the intended uses. For mammals, a revised long-term endpoint was agreed for quizalofop-P-ethyl in the meeting of experts. The acute and long-term risk to mammals from quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl was assessed as low for the intended uses. The risk to herbivorous birds and mammals from the common plant metabolites was considered to be low. The risk from consumption of contaminated drinking water was assessed as low for the intended uses of both ester variants. The risk from secondary poisoning was assessed as low for the intended uses of both ester variants and for the common metabolites.        Both quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl was found to be very toxic to aquatic organisms, based on the lower acute endpoints for algae and fish respectively. The risk from both active substances was assessed as low for the intended uses, based on FOCUS Step 2 PEC calculations. The aquatic risk assessment for metabolites was revised, based on the agreed endpoints for metabolites and PEC values derived from the GAP of quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl. Metabolite PEC values from the DAR of quizalofop-P-ethyl were used in the risk assessment, whereas EFSA did calculate new worst case PEC values for quizalofop-P-ethyl metabolites after the peer review. The risk to aquatic organisms from metabolites was assessed as low, based on FOCUS Step 2 and 3 for quizalofop-P-tefuryl and quizalofop-P-ethyl respectively. No risk from bio-accumulation was foreseen for quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl or any of the metabolites. In the initial assessment for non-target arthropods a potential in-field risk was identified from the use of quizalofop-P-ethyl. Extended laboratory studies were provided for relevant non-target arthropod species. The risk was addressed for all tested species, except for Typhlodromus pyri where the meeting of experts agreed that the in-field risk still needed to be addressed. For the uses of quizalofop-P-tefuryl the initial assessment indicated a high risk to T. pyri and Aphidius rhopalosiphi, both in-field and off-field. Extended laboratory studies were provided to address the risk for relevant species. A data gap was, however, agreed in the meeting of experts for the notifier to address the risk to Chrysoperla carnea. The risk assessment for non-target plants from intended uses of quizalofop-Pethyl indicated a need for no-spray buffer zones of 10 m to address the risk to the most sensitive plant species. No valid data were submitted to address the risk to non-target plants from the intended uses of quizalofop-P-tefuryl and a data gap was agreed during the peer review. A study was also required for quizalofop-P-tefuryl to address the risk to biological methods for sewage treatment. An assessment of the risk to biological methods for sewage treatment was provided in the DAR on quizalofop-P-ethyl, indicating a low risk. The risk to bees, earthworms, soil non-target micro-and macro-organisms was assessed as low for the intended uses of quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-Ptefuryl.

rayyan-1227191411,Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fluopicolide (Question No EFSA-Q-2009-309) Issued on 4 June 2009,2009,7,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,7,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Fluopicolide is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC2 the United Kingdom received an application from Bayer for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2005/778/EC3.        Following the agreement with the EU-Commission EFSA will organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after 30 June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State the United Kingdom made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on fluopicolide, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 12 December 2005.        The peer review was initiated on 11 January 2006 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation to the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in a written procedure in March 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in November / December 2007 and in January 2009.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States in a written procedure in April 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier which comprise foliar spraying to vine grapes against downy mildew and to potatoes against late blight. Full details of the GAPs can be found in the attached end points.        The representative formulated products for the evaluation were, 'AE F053616 06 WG71 A1'. or, 'EXP 11074B', a water dispersible granule (WG), containing 44.4 g/kg fluopicolide and 666.7 g/kg fosetyl-aluminium and, 'AE B066752 04 SC61 A1'. or, 'EXP 11120A', a suspension concentrate (SC), containing 62.5 g/L fluopicolide and 625 g/L propamocarb hydrochloride.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant and animal origin and environmental matrices. Since fluopicolide is not classified as acute toxic or very toxic, analytical methods for the determination of residues of fluopicolide in body fluids and/or tissues are not required.        In the mammalian metabolism studies, fluopicolide was moderately rapidly but incompletely absorbed orally (approximately 62 %) and widely distributed. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation, fluopicolide was extensively metabolised and rapidly excreted mainly via faeces.        The acute toxicity of fluopicolide in rats was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route, no skin irritation and only slight irritation to the eyes were observed. Fluopicolide did not exhibit skin sensitisation potential. The liver was the main target organ of fluopicolide in short-term tests in rats, mice and dogs. A sub-acute NOAEL of 17.7 mg/kg bw/day was based on the 28-day rat study. The relevant short term NOAEL was 7.4 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day dietary study in rat, based on haematological changes, clinical signs, liver and kidney toxicity at the next higher dose level of 109 mg/kg bw/day. As indicated in a mechanistic study, fluopicolide appears to be a phenobarbital-like inducer of liver enzymes. It is unlikely that fluopicolide presents a genotoxic hazard to humans. In a chronic rat study, effects on liver and kidneys were observed, but no tumour induction was found. Similarly, in a chronic study with mice, liver toxicity was observed. The increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas seen at high dose was considered not relevant for human risk assessment based on mechanistic considerations. Accordingly, no classification for carcinogenicity was proposed. The relevant long term NOAEL was based on the mice study with a NOAEL of 7.9 mg/kg bw/day, which was supported by the rat NOAEL of 8.4 mg/kg bw/day.        In a two-generation study no effect on reproduction or fertility was seen. Premature delivery, effects on body weight (dams and pups) and reduced crown-rump lengths at maternally toxic doses were observed in developmental studies in rats and rabbits; the relevant developmental NOAEL was the dose level of 20 mg/kg bw/ day from the rabbit study.        A series of fluopicolide metabolites were assessed for their toxicological relevance with the aid of toxicological studies conducted with M01(4), M02(5), M04(6), M05(7), M10(8) and M14(9). Plant metabolites M04, M05, M08(10) and M09(11), were considered less toxic than the parent. The M01 metabolite may be considered of comparable toxicity as the parent, although slightly more acutely toxic. In principle, the ADI of the parent could have been applied, however, as an acceptable set of studies were conducted with M01 and considering that M01 is also a metabolite of another active substance, an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.05 mg/kg bw/day was set for this metabolite as well as an acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.3 mg/kg bw. The metabolites M01, M03(12), M05, M10, M11(13), M12(14), M13(15) and M14 were not considered relevant according to the guidance document on groundwater metabolites(16) even if they appear at levels above 0.1 mu g/L in groundwater, however information is lacking on the metabolite M15(17), which was not peer-reviewed.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of fluopicolide was set at 0.08 mg/kg bw/day derived from the 78-week dietary study in mice and supported by the 2-year study in rats; a safety factor of 100 was applied. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was set at 0.05 mg/kg bw/day, derived from the 90-day rat study, corrected for limited oral absorption of 62 % and applying a safety factor of 100. The acute reference dose (ARfD) was set at 0.18 mg/kg bw, derived from the 28-day dietary rat study and the rabbit developmental study, applying a safety factor of 100.        For both representative preparations, the dermal absorption values were agreed at 0.24 % for the concentrate and 2.75 % for the in-use spray dilution. Considering only the fluopicolide component of these formulations, the level of operator exposure estimated at a maximum dose rate of 0.133 kg fluopicolide/ha in grapevines and 0.1 kg fluopicolide/ha in potatoes was below the AOEL for all scenarios proposed when gloves were used during mixing/loading and application and even when no personal protective equipment (PPE) was considered according to the German model and EUROPOEM. Estimated exposures for unprotected re-entry workers and bystanders were below the AOEL for both fluopicolide representative formulations.        Metabolism of fluopicolide was investigated in grapes, potatoes and lettuce. Metabolism was found to be moderate. Besides fluopicolide, its metabolites M-01, M-02 and M-06 were identified. With the exception of M-01 for which an ADI and an ARfD was set by the toxicology section, the metabolites were regarded as less toxic than the parent and/ or were also found in the rat metabolism studies. It was decided to include M-01 in the residue definition for risk assessment for plant matrices. As the metabolite M-01 is not unique to fluopicolide it was not included in the residue definition for monitoring. A sufficient number of residue trials on grapes and potatoes supporting the notified GAPs have been submitted to propose MRLs for these crops.        Metabolism in rotational crops was found to be similar, but more extensive as in primary crops. Additionally identified metabolites were M-04, M-05, M-08 and M-09. On the basis of the results of field studies on rotational crops, no quantifiable levels of fluopicolide are expected in consumable crop parts.        Metabolism studies on lactating diary and laying hens showed a low transfer into tissues, milk and eggs. Metabolism was extensive, mainly by hydroxylation followed by conjugation. The only hydrolysis product identified was metabolite M-01, which was included in the residue definition for risk assessment because of its toxicological potential. Dietary burden calculations showed only significant intake of fluopicolide residues for cattle. On the basis of available feeding studies on lactating cows, no quantifiable residues are expected in products of bovine.        Chronic and acute dietary intake calculations showed that an exceedance of ADI or ARfD is not expected for intake of crops after treatment with fluopicolide according to the notified GAPs. The level of 0.75 mu g/L is expected to be exceeded in groundwater by metabolites M-01, M-05, M-10 and M-11. A consumer risk assessment for the consumption of drinking water for these metabolites showed that an exceedance of the relevant reference values is not expected after chronic or acute intake of fluopicolide through drinking water.        Fluopicolide is of high to very high persistence in soil (DT50 (lab) (20) (degrees C) = 194 d - 411 d) under aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. In soil fluopicolide forms the metabolite M-03. This compound breaks down to M-01 and M-02. The metabolite M- 03 is of low persistence (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 2.2 - 5.0 d) in soils at acidic pH and of very low persistence (DT50 lab 20 degrees C < 5h) in soils at neutral or slightly alkaline pH and may be considered an intermediate in the formation of M-01 and M-02. M- 01 is of very high persistence in soil (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 557 - 1831 d) and M- 02 is of low persistence (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 3.2 - 4.6 d). No other metabolites were detected in significant amounts in the laboratory soil studies. Extent of degradation in sterilized and non sterilized samples was in the same range, indicating little contribution of microbiological degradation. M-01 was shown to be very stable in the two soils where it was investigated. Degradation of M-02 produced an extensive number of pyridine derivatives. Some of them were identified and characterized: M-10, M-05, M-14, M-11/12 and M-13. M-05 and M-10 are moderate to high persistent (M-05: DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 31 - 130 d; M- 10: 22 - 253 d), M-14 is low persistent in soil (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 5- 8 d). RMS considered that values obtained for half lives metabolites M-11/12 (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 38.5 - 86.1 d), M-13 (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 10.3 - 43.0 d), and M-10 (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 4.5 - 307 d) were not robust due to low and variable levels of these metabolites but acceptable to be used in groundwater modelling.        Fluopicolide was very stable under dark anaerobic conditions and only metabolites M- 01 and M- 02 were identified at minor amounts.        Photolysis degradation occurs to some extend but no new metabolites are identified in the available studies. On the absence of further data, the meeting considered that photolysis may contribute to some extend to the degradation of fluopicolide under natural conditions in EU and that the applicant should update their estimate of photolytic half life at 40 - 45 degrees N latitude.        Dissipation of fluopicolide under field conditions has been investigated in a number of field dissipation studies in Germany (3 studies, 3 sites), Spain, Southern France and Northern France. One of the studies performed in Germany and the studies performed in France were prolonged over some seasons to investigate the potential for accumulation of fluopicolide residues. Dissipation in most of the cases was better described by a biphasic model. Three soil dissipation and accumulation studies were conducted by the applicant in Germany (one site, 5 years), Northern France (one site, 4 years) and Southern France (one site, 4 years). The expert meeting agreed with the RMS and confirmed the initial evaluation that indicates that the plateau has not been reached in some of the studies.        For PEC soil calculations, the PRAPeR 37 expert meeting agreed using a SFO DT50 = 290 d for fluopicolide and a SFO DT50 = 315 d for M01 since they result in DT90 corresponding approximately to the worst case observed in the field studies. Potential for accumulation of fluopicolide and the metabolite M- 01 was confirmed by the PEC soil calculation (plateau are reached for the parent after 7 years in potatoes and after 9 years in vines and for the metabolite M-01 after 5 years in potatoes and 6 years in vines). Fluopicolide exhibits medium mobility in soil (K-Foc = 172 - 580 mL/g). M-01 and M-02 are very high mobile in soil (M-01: K-Foc = 31 - 51 mL / g; M-02: K-Foc = 1.1 - 10.5 mL / g). The metabolite M-03 is high mobile in acidic soil (K-Foc = 82 - 133 mL / g). Finally the metabolites M-05 and M-10 are very high mobile in soil (M-05: K-Foc = 11 - 49 mL / g; M-10: K-Foc = 0 - 10.66 mL / g).        A three years lysimeter study was performed in Germany. Due to the fact that fluopicoline was only labelled at the pyridine ring, no information on the potential leaching of M-01 was obtained from these experiments. A number of metabolites not previously identified in the laboratory degradation in soil studies were identified in the leachate of these lysimeter studies: M-05 (max. annual average concentration = 0.9 mu g / L), M-10 (max. annual average concentration = 0.83 mu g / L), M-11/12 (max. annual average concentration = 0.55/0.36 mu g / L), M-13 (max. annual average concentration = 0.14 mu g / L), M-14 (max. annual average concentration = 0.19 mu g / L), M-15 (max. annual average concentration = 0.095 mu g / L), M- 16 (max. annual average concentration = 0.08 mu g / L), M54 (max. annual average concentration = 0.03 mu g / L), P6A (max. annual average concentration = 0.03 mu g / L), P6A (max. annual average concentration = 0.07 mu g / L), M3 (max. annual average concentration = 0.04 mu g / L) and M29 (max. annual average concentration = 0.09 mu g / L)(18).        The mobility of the lysimeter metabolites M- 14, M-11/12 and M-13 was assessed with the HPLC method. All these metabolites are very high mobile. Due to the high polarity of M11/12 and M13, the results obtained were considered meaningless and a K-oc = 0 was assumed for the risk assessment. For M-14 was possible to estimate acceptable soil sorption parameters (K-oc = 19.2 mL / g).        A field leaching study in South West Germany is also available. Metabolite M-01 reached annual average concentrations up to 2.93 mu g / L at 120 cm depth on the third year after application.        Fluopicolide and its metabolite M-01 may be considered stable to hydrolysis under most relevant environmental conditions. Hydrolysis M-03 was pH dependent with half lives between 45.5 h (pH 5.1) to 9 min (pH 8.1).        Aqueous photolysis is unlikely to be a significant route of degradation of fluopicolide in the natural aqueous environment.        Fluopicolide and M-01 compounds should be considered not readily biodegradable.        Degradation of fluopicolide in the water sediment systems was very limited. RMS calculated whole systems half lives for fluopicolide in both systems (DT50 (whole system) = 873 - 1428 d). During the experiment, fluopicolide was partitioned to the sediment. At the equilibrium about 10 to 40 % AR remained as parent fluopicolide in the water phase. Only M-01 and M-02 were identified as degradation metabolites at low levels.        PECSW / SED values were calculated by means of FOCUS SW. FOCUS Step 1-2 were calculated for fluopicolide and metabolites M-01, M-02 and M-03. FOCUS SW Step 3 values were also calculated for fluopicolide.        The potential of ground water contamination by fluopicolide and the metabolites M-03, M-01, M-02, M-05, M-10, M-11, M-12, M-14 and M-13 was assessed in the original dossier for the use in vines and potatoes with FOCUS PELMO 3.3.2. Further modelling with FOCUS PEARL has become available during the peer review. Fluopicolide and its metabolites M-03, M-01, M-05, M-10, M-11, M-12 and M-13 may exceed the limit of 0.1 mu g / L annual average concentration at 1 m depth for at least one of the scenarios simulated. The metabolite M-01 also exceeded the limit of 0.75 mu g / L in a number of scenarios. For the use in vines fluopicolide exceeds 0.1 mu g / L annual average concentration at 1 m depth for more than half of the scenarios simulated.        In the lysimeter study, where potatoes were planted, annual average concentration of metabolites M-05, M-10, M-11, M-12, M-13 and M-15 at 1 m depth exceed the 0.1 mu g / L trigger, in the case of M-05 and M-10 also the trigger of 0.75 mu g / L was exceeded in at least one of the lysimeters in oneout of of the three years the experiment was performed. In the field leaching study metabolite M-01 reached an annual average concentration of 2.9 mu g / L in the leachate at 120 cm depth the third year after the product was applied.        Since half life in the atmosphere is longer than 2 d and fluopicolide is sprayed, formation of aerosols and long range transport trough the atmosphere cannot be excluded.        It was concluded that the risk for birds and mammals was assessed as low for both evaluated uses, except for the long-term risk for mammals for the use in vines. Risk mitigation measures should be required at Member Stated level. The risk from secondary poisoning and from consumption of contaminated drinking water was assessed to be low for birds and mammals.        A potential high risk was identified for the aquatic organism for both evaluated uses, therefore risk mitigation measures were required. The risk for bioaccumulation in fish from fluopicolide is considered to be low. The risk for the relevant metabolites to aquatic organism was assessed as low.        The risk for bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, other non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organism, non-target plants and biological methods for swage treatments, was assessed to be low.

rayyan-1227191412,Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance clofentezine Issued on 4 June 2009,2009,7,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,7,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Clofentezine is one of the 79 substances of the third stage part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2).        Clofentezine was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 July 2008 pursuant to Article 11b of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'). In accordance with Article 12a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as 'the Commission') in accordance with Article 12(1) of the Regulation. This review report has been established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report.        The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on clofentezine in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 22 August 2005. The peer review was initiated on 17 February 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Makhteshim Agan International Coordination Centre. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in August-September 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January 2009.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in March 2009.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as acaricide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying in pome fruit, stone fruit, grapes, strawberries and ornamentals for the control of mites. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Apollo 50 SC', a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 500 g/L clofentezine, registered under different trade names in Europe.        The minimum purity of clofentezine technical could not be concluded on, as the original manufacturing site was no longer in use, and the data on the new source could not be considered in the peer review.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible.        Adequate methods are available to monitor clofentezine residues in food/feed of plant origin and environmental matrices, however a data gap was identified for a confirmatory method for determination of clofentezine in commodities with high water content. Furthermore, pending on the final residue definition for products of animal origin, a data gap was identified for a fully validated method for the determination of the compounds in the residue definition.        In mammals, clofentezine is of low acute oral, dermal and inhalational toxicity; it is not a skin or eye irritant, nor a skin sensitiser. The main toxicological effect after repeated oral administration to mice, rats, and dogs was liver enlargement. The relevant short-term No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) are 2.65 mg/kg bw/day in rats, 151.4 mg/kg bw/day in mice and 1.7 mg/kg bw/day in dogs, whereas the relevant long-term NOAELs in rats and mice are 2 mg/kg bw/day and 5 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. Clofentezine does not have a genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. Clofentezine does not affect fertility or reproductive performance. Relevant maternal and offspring NOAELs are 4 mg/kg bw/day, based on increased liver weight and reduced body weight in parents and decreased pup weight in offspring, whereas the relevant reproductive toxicity NOAEL is 27.8 mg/kg bw/day. Clofentezine does not show any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits: the relevant maternal NOAELs are 250 mg/kg bw/day (rabbit) and 320 mg/kg bw/day (rat), whereas the developmental NOAELs are 1000 mg/kg bw/day and 3200 mg/kg bw/day, in rabbits and rats, respectively. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0.02 mg/kg bw/day was based on the long-term toxicity NOAEL from the 2-year rat study, with a safety factor of 100. The overall toxicological picture of clofentezine did not justify setting an Acute Reference Dose (ARfD). The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day was based on the NOAEL from the 90-day study in rat, with a safety factor of 100 and corrected by 50 % oral absorption. In all scenarios proposed for the operator applying 'Apollo 50 SC' exposure levels are below the AOEL (mainly with the use of personal protective equipment - PPE) as well as for bystanders; worker exposure estimates shows levels below the AOEL, except for re-entry in treated pome and stone fruit crops (107 % of the AOEL, no PPE considered).        The metabolism of clofentezine has been investigated in the fruit plant group only, on apple, lemon, peach and grape. The parent clofentezine was shown to be the major compound accounting for 55 % to 87 % of the total radioactive residue (TRR). The metabolic pathway runs through the cleavage of the tetrazine ring to form 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666), which is further oxidised to 2-chlorobenzamide (AE F092117), 2-chlorobenzyl alcohol and 2-chlorobenzoic acid (AE C500233, NC233). This degradation pathway is specific to plants, since no metabolites resulting from the cleavage of the parent compound were found in rat metabolism. Based on these studies, the plant residue definition for monitoring was limited to the parent clofentezine only. However, for risk assessment, the experts were of the opinion to include the metabolite 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666) in the residue definition, awaiting additional information on its toxicity and its toxicological relevance.        The residue trials were sufficient to propose an MRL for strawberries grown outdoor. For the other crops, the residue database was considered not relevant and incomplete, as the residue trials were mainly performed with application rates in excess of 50 % to the representative GAPs. A new residue data set in compliance with the critical GAPs was requested for plums, grapes and apples. Clofentezine residues were shown to be stable over 2 years in high water containing matrices.        In a standard hydrolytic study, clofentezine was totally degraded at 120 degrees C to form the metabolites hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) 3, 2-chlorobenzamide (AE F092117) and 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666). These metabolites are not covered by the rodent metabolism, and no information was provided on their toxicological relevance and their possible residue levels in the processed fractions. Therefore, no residue definition was proposed, and a new processing data set taking into account the parent clofentezine and its breakdown metabolites was requested in addition to clarification concerning their toxicity and their residue levels in the processed fractions. Transfer factors (TF) taking into account the parent clofentezine only were proposed for apple juice, apple wet and dry pomace, apple sauce, pasteurised canned strawberries and raisin. Transfer in grape juice and wine was identified as a data gap.        No standard rotational crop study was submitted, but considering the DT90 value up to 640 days in the aerobic field studies and the fact that outdoor strawberry crops may be rotated, the EFSA is of the opinion that a standard rotational crop study has to be requested.        The discussion concerning the metabolism of clofentezine in animals was not conclusive. No residue definition was proposed, even if there was clear evidence that the residue definition for animal products should at least include the parent clofentezine and the metabolite 4-hydroxy-clofentezine(4). Moreover, considering that the dietary intake by animals is mainly based on a processed commodity (apple pomace), it was concluded that information on the nature of the residues in the processed feed is needed prior to propose a reliable residue definition for animal products. Nevertheless, and considering the residues resulting from the representative uses, no residues above the LOQ (limit of quantification) are expected in animal matrices and there is no need to set a residue definition for animal products at the moment.        Using to the EFSA PRIMo rev2 model, the MRL of 2.0 mg/kg is proposed for strawberries, the highest TMDI (theoretical maximum daily intake) is 7 % of the ADI.        According to the available studies, clofentezine is moderate to high persistent in soil (DT50 = 16.8 - 109 days) under dark aerobic conditions. Under these conditions clofentezine yields two major metabolites: hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) (maximum of 13 % AR after 30 days in one soil) and 2-chlorobenzoic acid (AE C500233, NC233) (maximum of 13.6 % based on theoretical molar basis). The rapporteur Member State calculated the half-life of the metabolite hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) based on data in one soil (Cottenham) (DT50 = 43 days). This value was derived from the decline phase of the metabolite, ignoring the concomitant formation. The assessment presented by the rapporteur Member State may be regarded as a conservative estimate, since this half-life is used associated to a formation fraction of 1. A data gap for two additional half-lives has been identified in order to complete the minimum data set required. This data gap is not considered essential to finalize the EU risk assessment, however, the data may be needed by Member States when evaluating other potential uses of clofentezine. An additional data gap was identified for ground water and surface water exposure assessments for the metabolite 2-chlorobenzoic acid (AE C500233, NC233). Bound residue comprised up to 32.3 % AR and CO2 up to 40.7 % AR after 120 days.        The degradation seems to be enhanced under anaerobic conditions, with higher levels of bound residue (43.5 % AR after 90 days) and lower levels of CO2 (19 % AR after 90 days), than under aerobic conditions. However, no major metabolites were observed under the anaerobic test conditions.        Photolysis may contribute to the degradation of clofentezine in the environment. The only metabolite identified was 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666) that reached a maximum of 5.5 % AR at the end of the study (30 days). This metabolite should be assessed for potential ground water contamination.        Field soil dissipation trials from different locations of Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy are available and summarized in the DAR. Maximum plateau residue of 16 - 26 % of the initial applied concentration (on molar basis) of clofentezine was calculated to be reached after 3-5 years.        No batch soil adsorption/desorption studies are available for clofentezine because of the low solubility (3 mu g/L). According to an estimation (based on the octanol/water partition coefficient) clofentezine was considered to be low mobile in soil (K-oc = 1064 mL/g). The result was confirmed by available soil column leaching-and soil TLC (thin layer chromatography) experiments. A batch soil adsorption/desorption study was conducted with the soil metabolite hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) in three soils. This metabolite showed low mobility in soil (K-foc = 742 - 1084 mL/g). A possible pH-dependence was indicated by this study with lower sorption at higher pH.        The hydrolysis of clofentezine was pH-dependent (pH 5: DT50 = 10.4 days; pH 7: DT50 = 26.4 hours - 34.4 hours; pH 9: DT50 = 4.3 hours at 22 degrees C). The main hydrolysis product was hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) (maximum of 45 % AR at pH 9 and 22 degrees C), that was further degraded to the minor metabolites 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666) and 2- chlorobenzamide (AE F092117).        According to the information available, photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of clofentezine. A major aqueous photolysis metabolite was identified: 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666; maximum of 79 % AR). The meeting of experts concluded that this metabolite needs to be assessed for its fate and effects on the aquatic environment. Clofentezine is not readily biodegradable.        The degradation of clofentezine was investigated in one study in two water sediment systems. Clofentezine dissipated from the water phase via either partition to the sediment or degradation to metabolite hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600). Clofentezine whole system half-lives of 7.1 days - 13.1 days were observed.        The Step 4 FOCUS PECSW used in the risk assessment presented in the DAR were considered not appropriate for the EU risk assessment. The PRAPeR 63 meeting of experts on ecotoxicology did not agree with the acceptable concentration proposed by the rapporteur Member State in Addendum 2. With the agreed ecotoxicological end point, mitigation would be needed to demonstrate an acceptable use with respect to the aquatic environment. No new Step 4 FOCUS PECSW calculations are available, and therefore the aquatic risk assessment remains open. It should be noted that the ecotoxicological end point is also pending on the evaluation of a study that cannot be considered at this stage in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.        The meeting of experts agreed that PECSW/SED values for the aqueous photolysis metabolite 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666) are needed to finalize the EU risk assessment. No new calculations have been performed after the meeting of experts. The rapporteur Member State proposed in the list of end points to use the FOCUS Step 1 PECSW, calculated for the parent compound as a worst case surrogate for this metabolite in the EU risk assessment.        The potential ground water contamination by clofentezine and its soil metabolite hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) was assessed for the representative uses in apples (fruit/stone fruit), grapevines and strawberries. The calculated concentrations were all below 0.001 mu g/L. Whereas the EFSA Opinion on FOCUS GW models(5) requires that the calculations should be done with an additional model, it is not likely that in this case the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L would be breached.        During the peer review the need to assess the potential ground water contamination by the soil aerobic metabolite 2-chlorobenzoic acid (AE C500233, NC233) and the soil photolysis metabolite 2-chlorobenzonitrile ( AE F023666) was identified. Therefore, new data gaps have been identified for the corresponding studies and calculations.        Clofentezine may be considered slightly volatile. On the basis of the estimated atmospheric half-life of 5.1 days clofentezine would be considered relatively stable in air. The experts agreed that even when the volatilization from water and soil and plant surfaces is expected to be low, long-range transport in the atmosphere may occur due to the formation of aerosols when the substance is sprayed.        The acute and short-term dietary risk to birds was low, but a high long-term risk to insectivorous birds cannot be excluded for the uses in pome/stone fruit, vineyards, strawberries and ornamentals. The risk to mammals was assessed as low for all representative uses. The risk to aquatic organisms was assessed as low except for the long-term risk to fish. No full FOCUS Step 3 scenario resulted in a TER greater than 10. However, the long-term risk assessment for fish was based on a NOEC value from an early life stage study where only one concentration was tested. A new study was made available where more concentrations were tested. The new study was not taken into account in the peer review in view of the restrictions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007 and should be considered at Member State level.        The in-field hazard quotient (HQ) value was <2 for Typhlodromus pyri but not for Aphidius rhopalosiphi. No effects of >50 % were observed in standard laboratory studies with Trichogramma cacoeciae, Chrysoperla carnea, Phytoselius persimilis and Poecilus cupreus. Concerns remained with regard to the risk to sensitive life stages of non-target arthropods. The applicant submitted new studies to address the risk to sensitive life stages of non-target arthropods. The studies were evaluated by the rapporteur Member State in Addendum 1, but were not taken into account in the peer review in view of the restrictions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007. A litter bag study was triggered but not included in the original dossier. A litter bag study was submitted by the applicant and evaluated by the rapporteur Member State in Addendum 1, but the study was not taken into account in the peer review in view of the restrictions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.        The risk to bees, earthworms, collembola, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

rayyan-1227191413,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance lufenuron,2009,6,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,6,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Lufenuron is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Portugal being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on lufenuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 20 September 2006. The peer review was initiated on 20 April 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on grapes and tomatoes as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Match 050 EC"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC).        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a modified multi-method (The German S19 method). The extraction procedure was as detailed in S19 however, the analysis was performed by LC-MS/MS which is a detection method not used in the multi-method.        For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of lufenuron.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The outstanding issue is that the specification is not agreed.        With regard to its toxicological properties, lufenuron has shown a potential of bioaccumulation in fat, and a systemic bioavailability of 70%, with a very low metabolism. During the acute toxicity testing, lufenuron showed skin sensitisation properties and the classification as R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" was proposed. In oral short term studies with different species, clinical signs of neurotoxicity (tonic-clonic seizures or convulsions) and liver changes were observed, as well as some deaths in one dog study resulting in the proposed classification Xn, R48/22 ""Harmful: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed"". No mutagenic or carcinogenic potential was detected in the available studies. In the long term studies, the incidence and severity of the convulsions in both species were also taken into account for the setting of the NOAELs. No specific adverse effect on fertility or embryofoetal development was observed in the studies for reproductive toxicity, with low maternal toxicity (reduced body weight) and minimal offspring toxicity (delayed righting reflex). In a 4-month neurotoxicity study with rats, convulsions or fasciculations were induced at the high dose without any impairment of motor/cognitive functions or histopathological changes in the nervous system.        The agreed acceptable daily intake (ADI) was 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the second 1-year dog study (Altman, 1995), and the agreed systemic acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.01 mg/kg bw/day using the same dog study but applying a correction factor for bioavailability (70%). Both reference values were derived with the use of a safety factor of 100. The setting of an acute reference dose (ARfD) was not considered necessary. The agreed dermal absorption values for humans were 13% for the dilution and 2% for the concentrate. The operator exposure estimates with the German model for use in field or in greenhouse didn't show exposure levels above the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment.        The metabolism of lufenuron has been tested in three crop categories namely tomato (fruits), cabbage (leafy crop) and cotton (pulses and oilseeds). Lufenuron is always the major component of the residue, no significant metabolites were found. It was concluded that the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring is lufenuron. A full set of residue trials were supplied for grapes in the north and south of Europe. A full set of residues trials data were available for protected tomatoes; a reduced data set was accepted for outdoor tomatoes in the south as the use is much less critical.        The stability of residues in freezer storage was demonstrated for a period of two years. Sufficient processing data were submitted for tomatoes and grapes which showed an overall reduction of the residues in processed commodities. The rotational crop studies demonstrated that residues of lufenuron are unlikely to occur in crops planted after the treated crop is harvested. Given that lufenuron is lipophilic it is unlikely to be taken up by plants. The only possible issue would be soil contamination but this will easily be removed during preparation of food before consumption. From the representative uses in grape and tomato evaluated there is no animal intake according to the current guidance. However, metabolism studies in hens and goats were provided that demonstrated that the only significant residue that will be present is lufenuron. Feeding studies were also provided but it can not be concluded if the dose levels were appropriate, because there is no animal consumption expected for the representative crops. Lufenuron is a pair of enantiomers and it is currently not addressed if the ratio remains the same in the plant metabolism. Potentially the consumer risk assessment could under estimate the risk by a factor of 2 (assuming the residue is only 1 isomer and all the toxicity comes from it). For the UK consumer model intakes were highest for the vegetarian population subgroup at 10 % of the ADI using the STMR and 80% of the ADI when using the proposed MRLs. For the WHO European diet the TMDI was 3.42 % and IEDI was 0.62 %. For the Portuguese diet the TMDI was 20.22% and the NEDI was 2.63%. An acute risk assessment has not been conducted as an ARfD has not been set.        In soil under aerobic conditions lufenuron exhibits high to very high persistence forming the major soil metabolites CGA 2382772 (max. 32% applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence and CGA 2244433 ( max. 33% AR) which exhibits moderate to medium persistence. Under sunlight the major metabolite CGA 1497724 can be formed (max. 1 I%AR) which exhibits low persistence. Mineralisation of the dichlorophenyl ring to carbon dioxide was relatively limited accounting for 1-7 % AR after 91-100 days; this value for the difluorophenyl ring was 34% AR at 90 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 17-59% AR (range for both rings) after 90-100 days. Lufenuron is immobile in soil. CGA 238277 exhibits slight mobility, CGA 224443 is immobile or exhibits slight mobility and CGA 149772 exhibits very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either lufenuron or these metabolites were pH dependent.        In dark natural sediment water systems lufenuron partitioned rapidly to sediment where it degraded, exhibiting moderate to high persistence in sediment, to the metabolites CGA 238277 and CGA 224443 which exhibited moderate and high persistence respectively. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for only 0.2 % AR of the dichlorophenyl ring by 90 days but 11.8-36% AR for the difluorophenyl ring at 90 days. Unextracted sediment residues were a sink representing 6-15% AR and 12-37% AR for each radiolabel respectively at 90 days). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for lufenuron at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolites CGA 238277 and CGA 224443 and CGA 149772 that may leach from soil to surface water appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. Information on the fate and behaviour in soil and water of the individual enantiomers of lufenuron is not available. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by lufenuron, CGA 238277, CGA 224443 and CGA 149772 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        The acute toxicity to birds and mammals and the short-term toxicity to birds were considered to be low from exposure to lufenuron. Long-term reproductive endpoints of 19.7 and 8.7 mg a.s./kg bw/d were agreed by Member State experts for birds and mammals respectively. TERs from the standard tier 1 risk assessment indicated a low risk for all intended outdoor uses, except for the risk to small herbivorous mammals from the use in vine. A refined risk assessment provided after the peer-review and agreed by EFSA indicated a low risk, based on a vine foliar interception factor of 70%. The risk from consumption of contaminated drinking water from puddle was assessed as low. The risk from secondary poisoning for the worst-case vine use was assessed as low, based on a no-spray buffer zone of 5 m and 10 m respectively for fish eating birds and mammals. The potential for biomagnification was assessed as high for birds and mammals. Food-chain modelling indicated a low risk for all steps of the food chain for the worst case use in vine, based on appropriate mitigation measures (e.g. no-spray buffer zones). No mitigation measures were required for the tomato use. The risk to birds and mammals from the metabolite CGA 224443 was assessed as low by the RMS after the peer-review. The toxicity of lufenuron suggested a classification as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The lowest acute end point value for Daphnia magna was an EC50 of 0.4 mu g a.s./L, based on a formulation study. The lowest chronic toxicity to fish (NOEC=20 mu g a.s./L) was identified from a fish full life cycle study. A lower NOEC of 2 mu g a.s./L could potentially be derived from a chronic toxicity study with fish, pending further statistical analysis. The chronic study to daphnia was not accepted by member state experts. No new study was required as chronic toxicity to invertebrates was covered by a microcosm study. A NOAEC of 0.1 mu g a.s./L from the microcosm study was agreed by member state experts with an assessment factor of 2-3. The aquatic risk assessment for the tomato use indicated a low risk, based on the microcosm endpoint and no-spray buffer zones of 5 m. For use in vine a low risk was identified, based on a no-spray buffer zone of approximately 25 m. The latter assessment would be based on an assessment factor of 2. Application of an assessment factor of 3 would require further refinement of the risk characterisation for potentially more susceptible FOCUS surface water scenarios. The risk to sediment dwellers from lufenuron exposure was assessed as low in case of a no spray buffer zone of 5 m, as well as the risk from the relevant metabolites. Bioaccumulation and biomagnification was assessed, resulting in a BCF of 28.000 and a slow elimination rate. Risk assessment based on food-chain modelling suggested a low risk to fish, also considering the potential lower toxicity of 2 mu g a.s./L from the chronic fish toxicity study.        First tier risk assessment indicated a risk to bees. As the higher tier field studies were not accepted by member state experts, lufenuron should not be applied during the flowering season of the GAP crops. Further data were required to address the risk to bees from treated flowering weeds. The initial risk assessment to non-target arthropods from lufenuron (IGR) indicated a potential high risk. The higher tier field study was not accepted by member state experts. Further data were required to address the risk to non-target arthropods. The assessment of soil non-target macro-organisms indicated a potential high risk to collembola. The higher tier litter bag study provided to address the risk was not accepted by member state experts, as the exposure did not cover the expected plateau PECoil. Further data were required to address the risk.        The risk to earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

rayyan-1227191414,Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance cyflufenamid,2009,5,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,5,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Cyflufenamid is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC2 the United Kingdom received an application from Nisso Chemical Europe GmbH for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2003/636/EC3.        Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State, the United Kingdom made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on cyflufenamid, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available, which was received by EFSA on 30 January 2006.        The peer review was initiated on 10 May 2006 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation of the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in May 2007. The identified issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in November-December 2007.        A final consultation on the outcome of the experts. discussion took place during a written procedure with Member States in February -March 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying to winter and spring cereals against powdery mildew. Full details of the GAPs can be found in the attached end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, NF-149 EW., an oil-in-water emulsion EW), containing 50 g/L cyflufenamid.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant origin and environmental matrices, however a data requirement was identified in relation to the method for plants. A data requirement was identified for a monitoring method for the residues in food of animal origin.        In mammals, cyflufenamid is not acutely toxic via oral, dermal or inhalation routes; it is not a skin or eye irritant or skin sensitiser. In the short-term toxicity studies the dog was the most sensitive species showing alterations in the liver function and brain vacuolation. The relevant oral No Observed Adverse Effect Level NOAEL) is 4.1 mg/kg bw/day 1-year dog study). Cyflufenamid did not show any genotoxic potential. Increased incidences of thyroid tumours and hepatocellular adenomas were observed in male rats and mice, respectively, however, these were not considered to be of relevance for the risk assessment. The relevant NOAEL from the long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies is 4.4 mg/kg bw/day rat study). No specific effect on the reproductive parameters was found in multigeneration studies with rats: the relevant parental and offspring NOAEL is 18 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the reproductive NOAEL is 57 mg/kg bw/day. Tested in developmental toxicity studies, cyflufenamid did not cause malformations in the rat or rabbit: the relevant maternal NOAELs are 100 mg/kg bw/day and 5 mg/kg bw/day rat and rabbit, respectively); the relevant developmental NOAELs are 1000 mg/kg bw/day highest dose level tested) for rat, and 10 mg/kg bw/day for rabbit based on skeletal effects enlarged anterior fontanels and retardation of ossification). The Acceptable Daily Intake ADI) of 0.04 mg/kg bw/day was derived from the chronic rat study applying a safety factor SF) of 100. The Acute Reference Dose ARfD) is 0.05 mg/kg bw NOAEL for maternal toxicity from the developmental rabbit studies, SF of 100). The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level AOEL) of 0.03 mg/kg bw/day rounded) is based on the 1-year dog study with a correction for oral absorption of 70% and a safety factor of 100. The operator, worker and bystander exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment.        The metabolism of cyflufenamid was investigated in wheat and rotational crops. The metabolism was found to be moderate. Besides cyflufenamid, its E-isomer 149-E)-FB4 and further metabolites 149-F-2-OH-B5, 149-F-4-OH-B6, 149-F-a-OH-B7, 149-F8 and 149-F4BGlu9) were identified. The meeting of experts decided to include the E-isomer in the residue definition for plant matrices based on the assumption that the analytical methods used in the residue trials and for monitoring cannot separate the two isomers. The notifier was asked to confirm this assumption. Based on the results of a confined rotational crop study, no residues above the LOQ are expected in parts of rotational crops intended for human consumption.        Dietary burden calculations showed a significant intake of cyflufenamid through cereal straw and grain for dairy and beef cattle only. A metabolism study on ruminants was submitted and showed low transfer of residues into milk and tissues. Cyflufenamid was the main radioactive component in fat. However, in other tissues and milk, the metabolite 149-F110 was the main radioactive component. The meeting of experts decided to include 149-(E)-FB and 149-F1 in the residue definitions for animal matrices. It was concluded that bioaccumulation of cyflufenamid is not expected, and that no significant residues are expected in food of animal origin after feeding with cereal grain and straw treated according to the notified cGAP.        MRLs for wheat, triticale, rye and barley were proposed provisionally on the basis of the residue trials on wheat and barley, pending confirmation that the analytical method used in the residue trials covers the residue definition for food in plant matrices. MRLs for animal matrices should be set at the LOQ when an analytical method for animal products is available.        A chronic and acute dietary intake estimate was carried out by the rapporteur Member State. The theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) was below 1% of the ADI and the national estimated short-term intake (NESTI) maximum 2% for all considered consumer groups.        In soil under aerobic conditions cyflufenamid exhibits low to high persistence forming the soil metabolites: 149-F (low to moderate persistence), 149-F1111 (low persistence), 149-F1 (high to very high persistence), 149-F612 (very high persistence). Mineralisation to carbon dioxide represented less than 0.1% of the applied radioactivity (AR) in the fluorinated phenyl-labelled study, and represented 49.8% AR at 45 days in the cyclopropyl-labelled study. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 27.0-36.8% AR after 45-120 days. Cyflufenamid exhibits slight to low mobility in soil, with the four metabolites indicated above exhibiting very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of any of these compounds was pH dependant.        In dark natural sediment-water systems cyflufenamid dissipated from the water phase with a first-order DT50 of 3.6-5.0 days. Cyflufenamid partitioned to the sediment with a peak concentration measured 14 days after dosing of 63.0-64.8% AR. The more prominent degradation products in both systems were 149-F11 (maximum 15.5% AR in water and maximum 6.8% AR in sediment) and 149-F (maximum 7.1% AR in water and maximum 8.6% AR in sediment). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 0.5-3.5% of the applied fluorinated phenyl-U-[C-14] cyflufenamid. Unextracted sediment residues were a sink representing 8.4-19.1% of this radiolabel at the study end. The available surface water exposure assessment for cyflufenamid and for the metabolites 149-F and 149-F11 only considered the spray drift route of entry to surface water bodies, as FOCUS SW was not available when the DAR of cyflufenamid was written.        The potential contamination of ground water by cyflufenamid and its soil metabolites 149-F, 149-F1, 149-F6 and 149-F11, when used according to the proposed representative uses, was assessed with FOCUS GW PELMO (v. 3.3.2) model and the relevant scenarios. The results showed that for cyflufenamid and for the metabolites 149-F and 149-F11 no annual average concentration in the percolate at 1m soil depth exceeding 0.001 mu g/L is to be expected. The concentrations for the metabolite 149-F1 are in the range of 0.011 - 0.546 mu g/L. The concentration of 0.1 mu g/L is exceeded in 7 out of 9 European FOCUS scenarios parameterised for winter cereals. For the metabolite 149-F6 the estimated PECgw are > 0.75 mu g/L in all the simulated scenarios (80th percentile annual average concentration at 1m ranged from 1.566 rho g/L to 5.623 mu g/L). The toxicological assessment was able to conclude that the metabolites 149-F1 and 149-F6 are not relevant concerning groundwater at the expected concentrations.        Cyflufenamid is not expected to be transferred to the atmospheric compartment and the potential for long-range transport may be considered negligible.        The acute, short-term and long-term risk to herbivorous and insectivorous birds and the acute and long-term risk for herbivorous and insectivorous mammals was low for the representative uses in cereals at an application rate of 25 g a. s./ha. The risk from secondary poisoning and from the uptake of contaminated drinking water to birds and mammals can be considered as low.        Aquatic organisms were more sensitive to the lead formulation, NF-149 EW.. The potential exposure of surface water with the parent compound cyflufenamid and the soil major metabolites 149-F, 149-F1 and 149-F11 via the drainage and run-off routes of entry has not been assessed. The EFSA considers that the main route of exposure was via drift. Therefore, in case the new PECsw for the run-off and drainage are considered, it is expected that these would be lower than those obtained with the drift. The risk to aquatic organisms for the representative uses of cyflufenamid and its relevant metabolites can be regarded as low for exposure via drift. The resulting BCF (bioconcentration factor) exceeds the Annex VI trigger value of 100 for not readily biodegradable compounds. Nevertheless, the risk from bioconcentration in fish is considered to be low as more than 95% depuration was observed in 14 days.        Low acute and chronic risk to earthworms was assessed from the representative uses of cyflufenamid and its relevant metabolites.        The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target terrestrial plants and biological methods for sewage treatment was assessed as low.

rayyan-1227191415,CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance cadusafos,2009,5,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,5,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Cadusafos is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20002, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU- Commission.        Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on cadusafos in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 1 June 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant FMC Chemical. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005.        A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 9 February 2006 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion issued on 24 April 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 68)        Following the Commission Decision of 18 June 2007 (2007/428/EC) 4 concerning the noninclusion of cadusafos in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the notifier FMC Chemical made a resubmission application for the inclusion of cadusafos in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report as follows:        the potential contamination of groundwater.        the operators exposure.        the risk to birds and mammals.        its possible impact on non-target organisms        Greece, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted the additional report on cadusafos to the EFSA on 15 October 2008. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA dispatched the additional report to Member States and the notifier for consultation. The comments received were subsequently submitted to the Commission for evaluation. In accordance with Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the Commission subsequently requested the EFSA, by letter received on 8 January 2009, to arrange a peer review of the evaluation, i. e. the additional report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days.        The peer review was initiated on 14 January 2009 by dispatching the comments received on the additional report to the rapporteur Member State for examination. The rapporteur provided a response to the comments in the reporting table, which was subsequently evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues to be further considered in a series of scientific meetings via teleconferences with Member State experts in March 2009.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in March-April 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been re-issued to update the risk assessment in the areas of identity, physical, chemical and technical properties and methods of analysis, mammalian toxicology, residues, environmental fate and behaviour, and ecotoxicology.        The original conclusion from the review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide and nematicide as presented in the DAR, which comprise application by spraying or via the drip irrigation system to control a range of soil insects and nematodes in potatoes and bananas at application rates of up to 6 kg cadusafos per hectare. In case of potatoes incorporation into soil takes place after the application. It should be noted that during the peer review process the applicant stated that only the use in bananas will be supported in the EU review process. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as insecticide and nematicide, which comprise application via the drip irrigation system to control a range of soil insects and nematodes in bananas at application rates of up to 4 kg cadusafos per hectare. It should be noted that the use on potatoes was not supported in the resubmission application either, and therefore the conclusion has only been updated in relation to the risk assessment of the representative uses presented in the additional report, i.e. only the use on bananas at application rates of up to 4 kg cadusafos per hectare. The risk assessment presented for potatoes has not been updated.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, Rugby 200 CS., a capsule suspension (CS). Preparations containing cadusafos were registered in Cyprus, France, Greece and Spain.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Adequate analytical methods are available to monitor cadusafos in food of plant origin, environmental matrices and body fluids and tissues.        The absorption of cadusafos is extensive and rapid; the excretion is mainly via urine, without evidence of body accumulation. The acute oral toxicity is high, and the acute inhalation and dermal toxicity are very high. The proposed classification is T+, R26/27 ""Very toxic by inhalation and in contact with skin""; T, R25 ""Toxic if swallowed"".        The main effect after short-term oral administration is the decrease of cholinesterase activities in all species. Cadusafos has no genotoxic potential and is not considered to be carcinogenic. In the two-generation rat study, there was no effect on reproductive performance or fertility, and in the rat-and rabbit teratology studies, there was no evidence of teratogenic effects in the absence of maternal toxicity.        Supplementary studies were performed due to the introduction of a new impurity in the technical material. The acute and subchronic oral tests revealed no difference in toxicity. The Ames test was negative but not valid. A further assessment of the genotoxic potential of the impurity was required.        The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.0007 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.003 mg/kg bw. The comparison of the oral and dermal LD50 values results in a dermal absorption value of 100%. The operator exposure estimates are based solely on one specific and restricted representative use in bananas, with automatic drip irrigation, work rate of 1 ha/day, application rate of 4 kg a. s./ha, and assuming that the microcapsules in the formulation do not release cadusafos until they are diluted for application. The results are below the AOEL, with the use of gloves, according to the currently used models, which do not apply properly to this particular scenario. Worker and bystander exposures are expected to be very low due to the mode of application by drip irrigation.        The metabolism of cadusafos has been investigated on several crops after soil application. The use on potatoes can be considered as adequately covered by these data and the residue definition for this use can be cadusafos only, for both monitoring and risk assessment. The available residue trials in potatoes for Southern Europe are however not sufficient to draw a robust conclusion on the residue levels consumers may be exposed to. The available data suggest that residues are below 0.01 mg/kg, but results from trials in Northern Europe indicate that the currently available data may underestimate the actual situation. Further supervised residue trials should be carried out.        For the representative use on bananas, two metabolism studies for this crop were originally submitted, and the data were not sufficient to propose a residue definition. This was due to major deficiencies in the studies, making it impossible to evaluate the possible presence of degradation products still exhibiting the anticholinesterase activity of the parent compound.        Therefore, a new metabolism study in bananas was needed, as well as residue trials carried out according to the representative use pattern.        The situation for rotational crops has not been addressed by the notifier, although the soil persistence of the compound exceeds the trigger value for conducting uptake and metabolism studies in succeeding crops. Therefore these studies should be requested.        Based on the current knowledge of the residue situation in potatoes, the exposure of livestock is very low and metabolism studies in domestic animals do not need to be carried out. Only preliminary acute and chronic exposure assessments could be conducted for the use on potatoes, but these assessments need to be re-examined on the basis of complete and robust data. No MRLs can be proposed at this stage.        In the resubmission, only the use on banana is supported with a lower application rate of 4 kg as/ha instead of 6 kg as/ha, and a harvest interval of 90 days instead of 14 days. A new plant metabolism study showed that no significant metabolites are formed. None of the minor metabolites formed will have the anticholinesterase activity of cadusafos. The study confirms that the residue definition is cadusafos only. Overdosed residue trials showed that no significant residues will be present at harvest even with shorter harvest intervals. A TMDI calculation using the EFSA model showed that the highest intakes were < 5% of the ADI. The acute risk assessment gave intakes at < 30 % of the ARfD. The proposed MRL for banana is 0.01* mg/kg. It should be noted however, that cadusafos has two chiral carbons and it is not known if the ratio of the isomers remains the same as the material tested in the mammalian toxicity studies.        The available data demonstrate that in soil cadusafos degrades to the minor (< 10% applied radioactivity (AR)) metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone5. Mineralisation of the butyl-2-[C-14] radiolabel accounted for 43-71% AR after 90-120 days incubation at 25 degrees C. The values for residues not extracted by acetonitrile/water were 25-32% AR after 90-120 days. In soil cadusafos exhibited moderate persistence and methyl-2-butyl sulfone exhibited low persistence, though this categorisation for methyl-2-butyl sulfone is based only a single experimental DT50 value.        In guideline batch soil adsorption studies cadusafos exhibited medium mobility. There was no evidence of pH dependant adsorption. Data on the adsorption of methyl-2-butyl sulfone were not available. As this metabolite accounted for > 5% AR at two consecutive sampling points in a soil route of degradation study, data on its mobility in soil are required to enable a groundwater exposure assessment for this metabolite to be carried out.        In sediment water systems cadusafos exhibited moderate persistence and produced no major metabolites. It dissipated by partitioning to sediment, volatilising and mineralising to CO2 (butyl-2-[C-14] radiolabel accounted for 12-18% AR after 100 days incubation at 20 degrees C). Residues not extracted from sediment by acetonitrile/water accounted for only 6-8% AR at 100 days.        The available aquatic exposure assessment from the use on bananas (application via drip irrigation) just in Tenerife indicated that surface water exposure and consequently sediment exposure would be negligible. This conclusion is specific to this use in Tenerife and should not be applied to bananas grown elsewhere. The available aquatic exposure assessment from the use on potatoes is appropriate for addressing just the spray drift route of entry to surface water for initial PEC in aquatic systems. Surface water exposure and consequent aquatic risk assessments from the run-off and drainage routes of entry are not available for the potato use.        The available FOCUS groundwater modelling for bananas in Tenerife for the parent cadusafos and for the metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone are not satisfactory, and the potential for groundwater contamination is therefore currently unclear. New groundwater modelling is therefore required for cadusafos and for the soil metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone.        Cadusafos is moderately volatile and volatilisation will contribute to dissipation from soil and water. However, cadusafos is not expected to be subject to long-range transport via the upper atmosphere due to a relatively rapid calculated photochemical oxidative degradation rate with hydroxyl radicals.        In the first-tier assessment an acute and long-term risk was identified for insectivorous birds. A risk was also identified for earthworm-eating birds and mammals, as well as for fish-eating birds and mammals for the use in potatoes. Since the use in potatoes was withdrawn by the applicant, the refinements of the risk to birds and mammals from this use were not further considered.        For the use in banana plantations a high risk was identified for insectivorous and earthwormeating birds and mammals in a first-tier risk assessment. The proposed refinement was not accepted by the experts due to the lack of supporting data. However, due to the mode of application (drip-irrigation), only 16% of the in-field area is treated, leaving the majority of food items uncontaminated (the exposure of epigaec insects was considered negligible). This information could be used in a weight of evidence approach for a qualitative risk assessment.        Cadusafos is very toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The assessment indicates a high risk. However, for the specific use in banana plantations in Tenerife, the risk to aquatic organisms is considered low based on negligible contamination of surface water.        The toxicity to bees is high, but since for the proposed uses application will be to bare soil, the risk is considered low.        No in-field exposure of leaf-dwelling non-target arthropods is expected from the evaluated uses. For the application of cadusafos by drip irrigation to banana plants no off-field exposure is expected. No new data was provided with the resubmission dossier. No further data was considered necessary for the use in banana plantations, since only 16% of the in-field area is treated leaving enough uncontaminated refuges, which would allow the recolonisation of the treated area.        A high acute and long-term risk was identified for earthworms. The field study conducted in the United Kingdom was considered not appropriate for the risk assessment for banana plantations. A data gap was identified to provide information on the potential for recolonisation of earthworms in the treated area of banana plantations, or alternatively, a study on effects on earthworm populations in banana plantations.        A study with Collembola and mites was required to address the risk to other soil macroorganisms. No study with Collembola was provided with the resubmission dossier. However, the experts considered further data not necessary for banana plantations, since only 16% of the in-field area is treated leaving enough uncontaminated refuges, which would allow the recolonisation of the treated area.        The risk to soil micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment plants is low. For the drip irrigation use in banana no off-crop exposure is expected, and hence the risk to non-target plants is considered low.

rayyan-1227191416,Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance difenacoum,2009,4,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,4,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Difenacoum is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004,(2) as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.(3) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on difenacoum in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 16 July 2007. The peer review was initiated on 3 March 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Sorex Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in November-December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a rodenticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise manual application into protected bait boxes for rodent control. Full details of the representative use can be found in the attached endpoints.        Difenacoum consists of two diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers. A data gap was set for a new technical specification.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Neosorexa Pellets', a bait (ready-for-use) formulation (RB) containing 0.05 g/kg difenacoum.        Analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible, however a data gap was identified for storage stability study.        Monitoring methods to determine difenacoum residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin are not required, no MRLs are established. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in soil and water. Adequate methods are available to monitor difenacoum residues in tissues, however a method for the determination of residues of difenacoum in body fluids (blood) was identified as a data gap.        With regard to its toxicological properties, difenacoum is a direct anticoagulant that interferes with the blood clotting mechanism by inhibiting the vitamin K epoxide reductase. The active substance is well absorbed following oral administration, and widely distributed within the body with the highest concentration in the liver. Based on the results of the acute toxicity studies, the proposed classification was T+ R26/27/28 ""Very toxic by inhalation, in contact with skin, and if swallowed"". In repeated dose studies, no other toxic effect than reduced coagulation and haemorrhages were observed, leading to a short-term rat NOAEL of 0.03 mg/kg bw/day. In the in vitro genotoxicity studies, no gene mutation was induced in bacterial and mammalian cells, while two chromosome aberration tests gave positive results. As the three in vivo genotoxicity studies were negative, the overall conclusion is that difenacoum has no genotoxic potential. No multigeneration study was provided in the dossier. In the developmental studies with rats and rabbits, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In rats, no developmental toxicity was observed at a dose maternally toxic. Foetal effects in rabbits were observed in both the test and control groups, and were concluded as not dose-related. However, the experts considered that difenacoum should be regarded as teratogenic based on the knowledge about analogous compounds (other antivitamin K anticoagulants in humans), and they agreed with the classification proposed by the Specialised Experts on Reproductive Toxicity (Ispra, 19-20 September 2006) i.e. Reprotoxic Category 1, R61 ""May cause harm to the unborn child"".        The experts assumed that no contamination of crops would occur during the intended use, and concluded that the derivation of an acceptable daily intake and acute reference dose was not required. For the operator risk assessment, the agreed acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.000017 mg/kg bw/day (or 17 ng/kg bw/day), based on the maternal NOAEL in the developmental rabbit study with the use of an overall safety factor of 300. The additional safety factor of 3 was justified by the severity of the toxicological effects of difenacoum, the higher potency of the second generation anticoagulants (such as difenacoum) compared to warfarin, and the much higher vulnerability of human foetuses to vitamin K deficiency compared to rodents. For the operator exposure assessment, the exposure estimates for the biocide use(4) were considered as a worst-case scenario, which gave an exposure of 52% of the AOEL without the use of personal protective equipment. No worker or bystander exposure was expected due to the type of product assessed and the representative use in secured bait boxes.        Under the conditions of use as applied for (i.e. formulated bait in secure bait boxes), it is very unlikely that residues in food of plant or animal origin will occur. Therefore, it was concluded that the dietary consumer risk is negligible, and that data on the residue behaviour of difenacoum in plants and livestock animals are not required. No MRLs were proposed.        However, a situation has not been assessed where bait pellets are removed from bait boxes and hoarded by rodents because of their natural instinct. Depending on the treated area, this may lead to a situation where food or feed could become contaminated or where domestic animals might become exposed.        The consumer risk assessment is strictly based on the assumption of a 'no dietary exposure situation' for humans and livestock from the notified representative use, presuming that no contact of difenacoum with food, feed or drinking water will occur.        No reliable information is available on the route and rate of degradation of difenacoum in soil, though the information available indicates it has some persistence. The adsorption of difenacoum to soil would be expected to be pH-dependent at environmentally relevant pH, with lower adsorption expected at higher soil pH. Evidence from laboratory sieved soil column leaching studies indicates difenacoum would be expected to exhibit low mobility in soil including alkaline soils, though limitations in the design of experiments in three of the four soils investigated means it is not possible to conclude that difenacoum is immobile. Difenacoum is stable under conditions of sterile aqueous hydrolysis but undergoes rapid aqueous photodegradation. Information is not available on its behaviour in natural aerobic water/sediment systems. Though the available data are relatively limited, the available information is considered sufficient to complete an environmental exposure assessment at EU level for the applied for intended use, but only when formulated bait products are placed in secure bait boxes. When the product is used in this way, the potential for surface water body exposure was assessed as negligible. Also, when the product is used in this way, the potential for groundwater contamination by difenacoum above a toxicologically based concentration limit of 0.05 mu g/L was considered to be low.        The acute, short-term and long-term risk to birds was assessed as high, if birds can get access to the baits. The acute risk of primary poisoning was assessed as low for larger mammals like dogs or pigs, but a high long-term risk was indicated. Risk mitigation measures are needed, which are proven to be efficient, to prevent birds and larger mammals gaining access to the baits (e.g. bait boxes). The risk to birds and mammals from secondary poisoning was assessed as high. It is more difficult to mitigate the risk from secondary poisoning of birds and mammals. The efficiency and applicability of risk mitigation in the context of the application in the field, such as removal of carcasses during and after the control campaign, is uncertain and would need some further consideration. A high risk was evident for small non-target mammals. No risk mitigation measures were proposed. It is unclear if the risk to small non target mammals can be mitigated without reducing the efficacy of the product. Member States should be aware that it cannot be excluded that the suggested application of difenacoum in the field may also affect endangered/protected small mammal species potentially found in agricultural landscapes.        Difenacoum was very toxic to fish, aquatic invertebrates and algae. However, the risk to aquatic organisms was considered to be low because exposure of the aquatic environment was expected to be negligible from the applied for intended use.        The risk to bees, other arthropod species, earthworms, soil macro- and soil micro-organisms, terrestrial plants and biological sewage treatment plants was considered to be low because of negligible or low local point exposure.

Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide and acaricide for use on pome fruit, stone fruit, citrus and potato. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of endpoints.        The representative formulated products for the evaluation were 'Citrole', 'Arb'hiver', 'Arbofine' and 'Finavestan TS', all emulsifiable concentrates (EC).        For food and environmental matrices there are data gaps and currently it is not clear whether methods will be required, see sections 2, 3, 4 and 5.        Sufficient internationally accepted methods (e.g. ASTM and ISO) are available to characterise the technical material and formulated product. However, numerous data gaps have been identified for the physical and chemical properties of the technical materials and plant protection products.        During the mammalian toxicology meeting, concerns were raised over relevant impurities that require classification of paraffin oils as T ""Toxic"", carcinogenic category 2, R45 ""May cause cancer"". The meeting on toxicology confirmed that the impurities benzene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons are relevant and the specification as proposed by the notifier could not be accepted on toxicological grounds due to the high levels of relevant impurities. On this basis, no toxicological studies were required, no ADI, AOEL or ARM were proposed and no risk assessment of operator, worker and bystander exposure were conducted.        It was noted however that if highly purified paraffin oils were considered (i.e. no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the active substance), then no toxicological concern would be raised for consumers, operators, workers and bystanders. Sources of mineral oil are laxatives in pharmacy or oils used in food technology as release agents, for lubrication purposes, or as a substitute for fat. Paraffin oils are chemically inert substances, especially the straight chain (n) alkanes and on ingestion most of the mineral oil (about 98 % depending on the length of the C-chain) remains unabsorbed and is rapidly excreted, mostly unchanged, via faeces.        Acute toxicity studies have confirmed the low toxicity profile of paraffin oils. The experts agreed that no acute, short-term, long-term, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity studies would be required, provided that no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the substance. Paraffin oils are not considered to be genotoxic, carcinogenic, neurotoxic or toxic to the reproduction. Considering the low toxicity of paraffin oils (of high purity), no ADI, AOEL or ARfD would be necessary, and no risk assessment for operators, workers and bystanders would be required.        The list of endpoints on mammalian toxicology has been filled in considering that the technical material does not contain unacceptable levels of relevant impurities.        No information on potential levels of residues in food or feed items were presented in the DAR.        A consumer risk assessment has not been performed due to the possible high level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. If these compounds are present then it would result in a toxicological classification that would mean that these compounds could not be registered as plant protection products. The risk to consumers can therefore not be finalised.        With regard to environmental fate and behaviour, no information was provided in the dossier, nor presented by the RMS in the DAR, except for results from ready biodegradability studies that were carried out using a sewage sludge inoculum. Therefore only crude and incomplete environmental exposure estimates for surface water (only spray drift route of entry assessed) and soil, based on the applied for uses, could be made. With the exception of the requirement for ready biodegradability data, all data requirements remain open. No conclusion on the potential for groundwater exposure can be made using the information in the DAR.        The acute TERs estimated for fish and D. magna were above the Annex VI trigger when a non-spray buffer zone of 25 m was applied for the pome fruit uses. However, acute TERs values were above the Annex VI trigger values without the use of any non-spray buffer zone for the other evaluated uses.        The acute TERs for alga were above the Annex VI trigger values without risk mitigation for all the evaluated uses. Therefore, risk mitigation measures or refined of aquatic risk assessment were required.        The experts at the meeting agreed that in absence of data addressing the risk to bees, mitigation measures should be taken to avoid the application in the presence of bees.        Two field studies were conducted with two different plant protection products 'SAM 501' and 'Arbofine'. The intension of the first study was to determine the efficacy of the product 'SAM 501' on red spider mites in apples trees as well as the effects on Amblyseius andersoni in apple tree during summer. The purpose of the second study was to assess the effects on Typhlodromus pyri in apple orchards after the application of 'Arbofine' (1 x 2 hl/ha equivalent to 20.08 Kg a.s./ha). The meeting of the experts had some concern regarding the reliable of the A. andersoni study. The experts also expressed their concern regarding to the second study showed adverse effects on the T. pyri density (at least lasting 43 days) with only one application rate of 20 kg as/ha. The evaluated uses proposed in the GAP included the uses in citrus with 4 x 23.7 kg as/ha. The increase of adverse effects on T pyri populations with repeated application should not be disregarded. The experts agreed that further information to address the risk to non-target arthropods was necessary or mitigation measures should be requested at Member State level.        A data gap was identified during the experts meeting for the notifier to address the acute risk to earthworms.        There was no valid study to evaluated in the DAR assess the effects of paraffin oils on soil non-target micro-organisms, or soil non-target macro-organisms. Data gaps for information to address these issues are identified. The risk to birds and mammals, non-target plants and biological method of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on etofenprox in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 July 2005 and following a quality check on the DAR, on 14 February 2007. The peer review was initiated on 18 July 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Landis Kane Consulting. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in November-December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying in oilseed rape, head cabbage, grapes, peach and apple for the control of biting and sucking insects. Full details of the GAP can be found in the endpoints.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'TREBON 30EC', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 287.5 g/L etofenprox.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant and animal origin and environmental matrices.        In the mammalian metabolism studies, etofenprox was rapidly but partially absorbed after oral administration. It was uniformly distributed through the body, and transferred via placenta and via milk. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation; etofenprox was rapidly eliminated, mainly via faeces, a major part as metabolites.        The acute toxicity was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route; no eye or skin irritation was observed and no potential for skin sensitisation was found in a modified maximisation test. The main target organs of etofenprox were the liver and thyroid upon short-term or long-term exposure in the rat, which was the most sensitive species. The mouse presented also renal toxicity, but at much higher dose levels and the dog was less sensitive, showing effect only in the liver. The relevant NOAEL for short-term exposure was the dose level of 20 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day rat feeding study; for long-term exposure, the NOAELs in rat and mouse were similar. 3 1 mg/kg bw/day in mouse and 3.7 mg/kg bw/day in rat. No potential for genotoxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. The aetiology of the formation of the thyroid adenomas observed in rats was elucidated in a mechanistic study and considered not relevant for human risk assessment. Marginally increased renal cortical tumours found only in male mice at high doses were also not considered relevant to humans. No effect on the reproduction, fertility or development was found, however, considering the increased mortality of offsprings during the lactation phase, classification with R64, ""May cause harm to breastfed babies"", was proposed.        Further studies were provided on the plant metabolite alpha-CO2, which showed that its toxicity is covered by the parent's toxicity studies.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of etofenprox was 0.03 mg/kg bw/day based on the long-term mouse study and applying a safety factor of 100, which is supported by the long-term rat study. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.06 mg/kg bw/day based on the oral 90-day rat study, applying a safety factor of 100 and a correction factor of 30 % for low oral absorption. The acute reference dose (ARfD) was set at 1.0 mg/kg bw, based on the NOAEL of 100 mg/kg bw/day from the rabbit developmental toxicity study and a safety factor of 100. A default value of 30 % was agreed for dermal absorption.        The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation ""TREBON 30EC"", at a maximum dose rate of 0.21 kg etofenprox/ha in high crops (grapes, peaches and apples) was below the AOEL when the use of gloves was considered; in field crops (oilseed rape and head cabbage), no personal protective equipment (PPE) was needed to achieve an operator exposure estimate below the AOEL, according to the German model. According to the UK POEM model, estimated operator exposure was above the AOEL, even when the use of PPE was considered. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with etofenprox was below the AOEL, if PPE were worn (protective gloves, long-sleeved shirt and long trousers). Bystander exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL.        Concerning the plant and animal metabolism studies, the meeting of experts discussed the unusual way the experiments were conducted, using applications of a 1:1 mixture of both labelled forms in a single study, instead of two distinct radioactive labels from two separate studies. After discussion, the experts were of the opinion that such studies may only be accepted when no extensive cleavage of the parent molecule is observed. Thus, in the specific case of etofenprox, this practice could be accepted as no extensive metabolism was observed in plants and animals Otherwise, in the case of an extensive metabolism and/or early cleavage of the parent molecule, the recovered levels of the different metabolites may be underestimated, when compared to the initial radioactive level of parent molecule. In such situation, the meeting re-enforced its opinion that metabolism studies must be conducted separately according to the different labelling forms, in order to depict the fate of each labelling portion of the molecule as completely as possible and to provide reliable quantitative information.        In plants, the metabolism of etofenprox has been investigated in rapeseed, grape and lettuce. The metabolism was limited and etofenprox was found to be the major compound of the residues, the other metabolites being detected in very low proportions, up to 7% of the TRR for the alpha-CO metabolite. However and considering that the alpha-CO metabolite was observed in proportions higher than 10 % of the etofenprox levels in the supervised residue trials, the meeting of experts decided to define the residue for risk assessment and monitoring as the ""sum of etofenprox and alpha-CO expressed as etofenprox"". Sufficient supervised residue trials were submitted to propose MRLs on rape seed (Northern GAP) and on head cabbage, grape, peach and apple (Southern GAP). The storage stability studies demonstrated that etofenprox and alpha-CO residues were stable under freeze storage conditions for at least two years in oil and water-containing matrices. A standard hydrolytic study was identified as a data gap and additionally, one balance study and three follow-up studies were requested for red wine and for raisin. Processing transfer factors could be calculated for some rape seed, apple and peach processed commodities.        For animals, the experts discussed the validity of the metabolism studies performed with the parent etofenprox only. Considering that the alpha-CO metabolite was shown to be a significant constituent of the residues in plants, the experts were of the opinion that information on the fate of this compound in the ruminant metabolism has to be requested. The parent etofenprox was found to be the major residue in all goat and hen matrices, and the residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was set provisionally as ""etofenprox"", awaiting the requested information on the alpha-CO metabolite. Based on the cow feeding study and the animal burden calculations, MRLs were proposed for milk and ruminant products.        The chronic and acute consumer risk assessments were performed using the EFSA and the UK PSD models. Using the MRLs proposed for plant and animal products, the calculated theoretical maximum daily intakes (TMDI) and international estimated short term intakes (IESTI) were shown to be below the ADI and ARfD values.        Degradation of etofenprox in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C occurred through oxidation at different parts of the molecule followed by breaking down in smaller moieties (DT50 = 7 - 57.7 days). In one study, one of the metabolites, alpha-CO, was observed to exceed 5 % AR in one of the soils (DT50 = 12 - 45 days). Unextracted radioactivity amounted to a maximum of 55.8 % AR after 55 days, and mineralization (CO2) up to a maximum of 45.6 % AR after 120 days. Under dark anaerobic conditions at 20 degrees C, etofenprox is highly persistent in soil (DT50 = 174 days). Under these conditions metabolite 4'-OH3 was identified as a major metabolite. Mineralization was negligible, and unextractable residue in soil amounted to 9.5 % AR after 121 days. Photolysis only slightly enhanced degradation of etofenprox in soil. PEC soil were calculated for etofenprox based on the soil half-life of 25 days for all representative uses. The meeting of experts agreed that these values could be used for the risk assessment.        According to the results of available soil batch adsorption/desorption experiments, etofenprox may be classified as immobile in soil (Koc = 8548 - 14923 mL/g). The meeting of experts identified a data gap for an additional batch soil adsorption/desorption study, but considered it not essential to finalize the EU risk assessment. The metabolites alpha-CO and 4'-OH were estimated to be immobile with PCKOCWIN (EPA).        Chemical hydrolysis is not expected to contribute to the environmental degradation of etofenprox. The photolysis of etofenprox is relatively rapid. The major aqueous photolysis metabolites were alpha-CO (max 63.6 %) and PENA(4) (max. 14.4 %). The metabolite alpha-CO was also found to reach up to 10% of the parent's applied amount in the outdoor mesocosm study.        On the basis of the available studies, etofenprox should be considered not ready biodegradable. In water/sediment systems, partition of etofenprox to the sediment occurs during the first seven days. The meeting of experts agreed on the half-lives calculated for etofenprox in the whole system (DT50 whole system = 6.5 days - 20.1 days). The metabolite 4'-OH was identified as a major metabolite in the sediment phase of both systems.        The meeting of experts discussed the need to consider aqueous photolysis and photolysis metabolites for the EU risk assessment, and agreed that the risk assessment presented for the metabolite alpha-CO by the applicant could be regarded as conservative.        PECSW were calculated with FOCUS SW modelling for the relevant scenarios based on the soil halflife of 25 days. Degradation in the water phase was assumed to occur with a half-life of 1000 days, and the mean whole water/sediment system half-life was applied to the sediment phase. Step 3 and Step 4 (only oilseed rape; assuming 30m spray drift buffer zone) were calculated for the representative uses. PECSW of the aqueous photolysis metabolite alpha-CO was estimated to be 63.6 % of the PECsw of the parent compound. Worst case PECsw were also estimated for the sediment metabolite 4'-OH as 21.9 % of the PECsw calculated for the parent compound. The meeting of experts identified the need to recalculate PECSED for the parent compound for the uses different from oilseed rape, to take into account the accumulation of etofenprox after multiple applications and the PECSED of the metabolites alpha-CO and 4'-OH. The necessary PECSW / SED values were provided by the rapporteur Member State in the addendum Volume 3 v3 after the meeting of experts.        Neither etofenprox nor its soil metabolite alpha-CO is expected to exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g /L for any of the representative uses and scenarios simulated. The environmental concentrations in air and transport through air of etofenrprox are considered negligible.        The risk assessment indicated low risk to birds and mammals for all intended uses. Refinements of the long-term risk assessment for mammals were, however, required for the uses in head cabbage, grape, peach and apple to meet the Annex VI trigger. The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals was considered to be low for all of the intended uses, as was the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals for the intended use in oilseed rape. Further refinements were still required to address the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals for the intended uses in head cabbage, grapevine, peach and apple. The acute risk to birds and mammals from consumption of contaminated drinking water from puddles was assessed as low for all intended uses of etofenprox. Etofenprox was not considered to biomagnify in the terrestrial food chain, and the risk from plant metabolites was assessed to be low. The risk to aquatic organisms was not addressed for any of the intended uses. The TER values for aquatic organisms, based on tier 1 effect data and FOCUS Step 3 and 4, failed to meet the Annex VI trigger value. The use of an endpoint from the available higher tier mesocosm study would require further supportive data. Member State experts suggested that single species tests on the most sensitive species from the mesocosm study should be provided to consolidate the confidence in the data from the mesocosm. The design of the single species tests should take into account the multi-application uses. Based on the additional studies, a relevant assessment factor should be reconsidered for a refined aquatic risk assessment. A fish full life cycle (FFLC) study was required by the Member State experts, which should be included in the aquatic risk assessment. The risk to sediment dwellers should be addressed for etofenprox and for the metabolites 4'-OH and alpha-CO. Also, the aquatic risk assessment for alpha-CO would have to be refined further for uses in head cabbage, grapevine, peach and apple. In addition, the risk from biomagnification and potential endocrine disrupting effects on aquatic organisms should be addressed.        Hazard quotient (HQ) values indicated a high risk to bees from all intended uses. Member State experts concluded that the available field studies did not address the risk to bees, and they agreed that mitigation measures were needed for pre-flowering/flowering uses in oilseed rape, grapevine and apple to avoid exposure of bees. The Tier I risk assessment indicated a high in-field risk to Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri for all intended uses. The off-field risk was considered to be low for A. pyri and A. rhopalosiphi for uses in oilseed rape and head cabbage, based on no-spray buffer zone of 1 and 5m, respectively. Higher tier risk assessment based on extended laboratory studies with A. rhopalosiphi, T pyri, Orius laevigatues and Chrysoperla carnea still indicated a high in-field risk to non-target arthropods. The potential for in-field recovery was not addressed in the draft assessment report. The higher tier off-field risk assessment indicated a low risk to non-target arthropods for uses in oilseed rape and head cabbage, with no-spray buffer zones of 1 and 5m, respectively. For uses in grapevine, the assessment indicated a need for a no-spray buffer zone of 10m to identify a low risk. Further refinements were required to address the off-field risk to non-target arthropods for uses in peach and apple.        The risk to earthworms, non-target micro- and macro-soil organisms and non-target plants was assessed as low for all intended uses.

rayyan-1227191419,CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of propaquizafop (an ester variant of quizalofop-P) Issued on 26 November 2008,2009,3,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,3,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Propaquizafop is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002.(1) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on propaquizafop in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 22 September 2005. The peer review was initiated on 12 May 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the sole notifier Makhteshim Agan and the Member States. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in October 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        Propaquizafop is an ester variant of the active substance quizalofop-P-2 which is included in the third stage Part B of the review programme. The EFSA wrote a conclusion on quizalofop-P based on the DARs which were submitted on the ester variants quizalofop-P-ethyl(3) and quizalofop-P-tefuryl.(4)        This conclusion on propaquizafop was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on sugar beet and oilseed rape. Full details of the good agricultural practice (GAP) can be found in the attached list of endpoints.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Agil 100 EC', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC).        The meeting of experts was not able to conclude on the acceptability of any of the methods as none of the methods were capable of analysing for the original residue definition proposed in the DAR. As it is not possible to reconsider all the methods at this time no conclusion can be reached. A general data gap for reconsideration of the methods has been identified.        There are insufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The specification of the technical material has not been accepted. The method of analysis for the formulation is identified as a data gap. The formulation was seen to perform poorly in some of the physical-chemical tests. And there are outstanding issues on possible relevant impurities.        In mammals, propaquizafop shows a low acute toxicity via the oral and dermal routes, as well as via inhalation; it is non-irritating to the skin and eyes. Skin sensitisation tests in guinea pigs gave positive results (R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" was proposed). In repeated dose studies, liver was shown to be the target organ. The short-term toxicity No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) for rats and mice were 6.25 and 10 mg/kg bw/day, respectively, on the basis of liver effects (Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Levels - LOAELs 25 and 30 mg/kg bw/day, respectively); in long-term studies the relevant NOAELs were set at 5 mg/kg bw/day for rats and 1.5 mg/kg bw/day for mice (LOAELs 25 mg/kg bw/day and 7.5 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). Propaquizafop did not show any genotoxic potential. Increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were seen in both rats and mice. In one study in rats, an increase in Leydig cell tumours was also noted. Mechanistic studies performed in rats and mice indicate that propaquizafop acts as a peroxisome proliferator. Based on the occurrence of malignant tumours in two species (hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in rats and mice) and on an increased incidence of Leydig cell tumours in rats, proposal for classification and labelling of propaquizafop as Carc. Cat. 3 R40(""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"") was considered and proposed during the meeting. In a multigeneration reproductive toxicity study, there were no treatment-related effects on mating performance, fertility index, gestation length or gestation index. The relevant reproductive NOAEL was 15 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the relevant maternal and offspring NOAEL were 3 mg/kg bw/day. In a rat developmental study, numbers of implantations, corpora lutea and viable foetuses were comparable among groups. No treatment-related skeletal malformations were observed in any dose group. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 20 mg/kg bw/day based on an increased incidence of dilated renal pelvis up to 50 mg/kg bw/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 50 mg/kg bw/day due to decreased body weight gain at 125 mg/kg bw/day. In rabbits, there were no treatment related malformations or developmental changes. The relevant maternal and developmental NOAELs were 6 mg/kg bw/day and 18 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0.015 mg/kg bw/day was based on the NOAEL of 1.5 mg/kg bw/day from the mouse long-term study ( Safety Factor (SF): 100); the NOAEL of 6.25 mg/kg bw/day from the rat 90 day study was the basis for the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.04 mg/kg bw/day, SF 100 and limited oral absorption (65%). Based on the acute toxicological profile of the propaquizafop, the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not allocated. The operator, worker and bystander exposure assessment is below the AOEL even without the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).        The metabolism of propaquizafop has been investigated in cotton, soybean, lettuce and sugar beet using C-14-propaquizafop labelled on the phenyl and/or the quinoxaline moiety. The metabolism proceeds primarily with the hydrolysis of the ester link to yield quizalofop followed by the loss of the propionyl moiety leading to quizalofop-phenol(5), these metabolites being also observed as conjugates. Further metabolism occurs by hydroxylation of the quinoxaline moiety giving hydroxy-quizalofop(6) and hydroxy-quizalofop-phenol(7). In addition and in a limited extent, the presence of quinoxaline metabolites and phenoxy acid metabolites indicated a cleavage of the oxygen bond of the molecule. In the sugar beet study, the metabolites quizalofop-phenol, hydroxy-quizalofop-phenol, hydroxy-quinoxaline(8) and dihydroxy-quinoxaline(9) were detected in leaves and roots in similar proportions to propaquizafop and quizalofop. However, taking into account the overall low residue levels expected in leaves and roots at harvest, these metabolites were not included in the plant residue definition. Finally, considering that the radioactivity was not sufficiently characterized in sugar beet and in cotton seeds the notifier was asked to provide clarifications on the uncharacterized radioactivity, otherwise a new metabolism studies on root crop on oilseed crop should be submitted. In conclusion and provisionally the experts proposed the following residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment:        ""Sum of propaquizafop and quizalofop, expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers)"". Considering the metabolism studies performed with the three quizalofop esters, a common residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was proposed for propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl as:        ""Sum of quizalofop-esters, quizalofop and quizalofop conjugates expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers)"".        These definitions should remain provisional, pending the submission and the evaluation of the requested information on the toxicological relevance of the phenoxy metabolites observed in the quizalofop-P-ethyl studies. After the meeting, the EFSA was however of the opinion that there is no need to include the conjugates in the residue definition for monitoring.        Supervised residue trials were submitted to support representative uses on rape seed and sugar beet. Samples were analysed using a method covering propaquizafop, quizalofop and quizalofop-phenol. Although this method was not strictly in line with the residue definition, results were considered as valid since the scope of this method was wider than the proposed residue definitions. The storage stability study showed the residues of propaquizafop, quizalofop and quizalofop-phenol to be stable under deep freeze storage conditions for at least 2 years in soya, rapeseed and tomato matrices. The behaviour of the residues in processing products was not investigated due to the low residue levels detected in the raw agricultural products.        A rotational crop study performed with C-14-propaquizafop labelled on the quinoxaline moiety was provided. Propaquizafop was not observed in the different rotational plant parts investigated and the detected metabolites (quizalofop, quizalofop-phenol and their hydroxy derivatives) have also been identified in the primary crop studies, suggesting a similar metabolic pathway in both primary and rotational crops. Taking into account the residue levels observed in plants at harvest, it was concluded that no significant residues of propaquizafop or its metabolites are expected in rotational crops.        Metabolism studies in lactating goat and laying hen were provided. However, the meeting of experts concluded that no residue definitions can be established on the basis of these studies since the characterisation of the radioactivity was not sufficiently investigated in some matrices, especially in fat. However, and taking into account the low residues levels observed in rapeseed and sugar beet, the experts agreed that there is no need to set a residue definition in products of animal origin for propaquizafop at the moment. No feeding study was provided, the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg in diet being not exceeded.        Considering the comparative metabolite distribution in rat and goat for quizalofop-P-ethyl and propaquizafop, the experts discussed whether a supplementary metabolism study on pig should be requested. The metabolism in rats and ruminants was similar qualitatively but differences were observed quantitatively. Higher residues were detected in rat on an equivalent mg/kg bw basis and the notifiers were asked to provide explanations for these quantitative differences. Such request is not relevant for propaquizafop at the moment, but this point would have to be considered if new uses beyond those supported in this review lead to a significant residue intake by animals.        No chronic risk for the consumer resulting from the use of propaquizafop according to the representative uses on sugar beet and oilseed rape is expected since the Theoretical Maximum Daily Intake (TMDI) using various calculation models was at most 21% of the ADI (0.015 mg/kg bw/d) using the UK model. No acute evaluation was performed as no ARfD was set for propaquizafop.        Based on the available supervised residue trials and the proposed residue definition a MRL of 0.05* mg/kg was proposed on sugar beet and rape seed, these MRLs being consistent with the proposals done for quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl on these crops.        In the environmental fate and behaviour section, the data sets for the common metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop and dihydroxy-quinoxaline available in the DARs of propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl were combined in order to derive a single set of endpoints (amalgamated list of endpoints) for the fate properties of each metabolite to use in the environmental exposure assessment.        In soil under aerobic conditions propaquizafop exhibits very low persistence forming the major soil metabolite quizalofop (accounting for up to 88% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to high persistence, the metabolite hydroxy-quizalofop accounting for up to 33% AR which exhibits low to medium persistence, and the metabolite dihydroxy- quinoxaline accounting for up to 14% AR which exhibits moderate to high persistence. The metabolite hydroxy-quinoxaline (up to 8.8% AR) was present at levels that trigger a groundwater exposure assessment and exhibits moderate to medium persistence. Another minor non transient metabolite in soil (max. 5.4 - 5.7% AR in three consecutive sampling points) was quizalofop-phenol. Mineralisation of the hydroquinone ring or the quinoxaline group to carbon dioxide ranged from 22.6% AR (after 121 days) to 44.2% AR (after 119 days). The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 36 - 39 % AR after 120 - 121 days. Due to the rapid degradation of propaquizafop in soil under aerobic conditions, batch equilibrium studies with the parent compound were not performed. An adsorption Koc of 2220 mL/g has been estimated for modelling purposes, based on the n-octanol/water partition coefficient Log Kow. Quizalofop and hydroxy-quizalofop exhibit low to high mobility in soil, dihydroxyquinoxaline exhibits low to very high mobility, and hydroxy-quinoxaline exhibits very low mobility in soil. Based on the adsorption properties of the minor non transient metabolite quizalofop-phenol (slight mobility to immobile) a groundwater exposure assessment for this metabolite was considered not necessary. There was no indication in the available data that adsorption of either propaquizafop or its identified soil metabolites was pH dependent.        In dark natural sediment water systems propaquizafop degraded very rapidly to the metabolites quizalofop (max. 90 % AR in water and max. 45% AR in the sediment), dihydroxy-quinoxaline (max. 10% in the sediment) and hydroxy-quizalofop (max. 11.2% AR in the sediment). The estimated rate of degradation in the aquatic system (DT50 (system), DT50 water, DT50 sed) for propaquizafop and its metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop, dihydroxy-quinoxaline and hydroxy-quinoxaline are not peer reviewed and were not used in the risk assessment. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for hydroxy- quizalofop, dihydroxy- quinoxaline and hydroxy-quinoxaline (Steps 1 and 2) and for propaquizafop and quizalofop (up to Step 3). The initial predicted environmental concentrations in surface water (PECsw) and in sediment (PECsed) were used with the appropriate toxicity endpoints for the calculation of the toxicity exposure ratios (TERs).        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by propaquizafop and its metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop, dihydroxy-quinoxaline, and hydroxy-quinoxaline above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        The lower metabolite toxicity endpoints available in the dossiers for propaquizafop, quizalofop-Pethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl were used in the risk assessments of propaquizafop.        The acute and short-term risk to birds was assessed as low for the intended uses at tier one, as was the long-term risk to herbivorous birds. Further refinements were required to address the risk to insectivorous birds. The rapporteur Member State provided a refined risk assessment in an addendum after the expert meeting (Addendum, July 2008), based on yellow wagtail (Motacilla flava) as generic focal species feeding on a mixed small-large arthropod diet. A TER value of 14.8 was calculated using wet weight based proportion of different food types (PD) refinements, indicating a low long-term risk to insectivorous birds from the intended uses. The first tier acute and long-term TERs were above the Annex VI trigger for mammals, indicating a low risk from the intended uses. All TERs for secondary poisoning to birds and mammals were above the Annex VI trigger, indicating a low risk from all intended uses. The acute risk from consumption of contaminated drinking water was assessed for the puddle scenario. TERs were above the Annex VI trigger of 10 for both birds and mammals. The risk to herbivorous birds and mammals from plant metabolites was not addressed in the DAR or during the peer review. Mammal toxicity and metabolism data, however, suggest that the risk to herbivorous mammals was covered by the risk assessment for the parent substance. Propaquizafop was found to be very toxic to aquatic organisms, with fish being the most sensitive species tested. A comparable toxicity was identified for the macrophyte Glyceria fluitans exposed to the metabolite quizalofop. FOCUS Step 3 exposure refinements were required to identify a low risk to aquatic organisms. For use in sugar beet all FOCUS Step 3 scenarios indicated a low risk to aquatic organisms, whereas only 3 out of 5 scenarios for spring use in oilseed rape and 2 out of 6 in winter oilseed rape indicated a low risk to aquatic organisms. The risk to sediment dwellers and the risk from bioaccumulation were assessed as low. The risk to non-target arthropods needed to be refined further to address the in-field risk to Aphidius rhopalosiphi. A no-spray buffer zone of 5 m was required to identify a low risk to the non-target plants, based on the most sensitive vegetative vigour endpoint for oat.        The risk to bees, earthworms, biological methods for sewage treatment and other soil non-target macro- and micro-organisms was assessed as low.

rayyan-1227191420,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triflumuron Issued on 30 September 2008,2009,3,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,3,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Triflumuron is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triflumuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 28 February 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on apples, pears, peaches and nectarines. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Alsystin SC 480"", a suspension concentrate (SC), containing 480g/l triflumuron.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition except for air where a data gap has been identified. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.        Sufficient data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Data for the relevant impurities is missing and the specification can not be finalised. A method for the active substance in the plant protection product has been identified as a data gap. Also some physchem properties have been identified as data gaps.        With regard to its toxicological properties, triflumuron is extensively absorbed after oral administration and has a low acute toxicity. The main adverse effect after repeated administration is haemolytic anaemia with compensative responses and secondary effects in different organs. No mutagenic or carcinogenic potential has been demonstrated in the available tests. In the reproductive toxicity testing, no specific effects on the fertility parameters, on the growth of the offspring or on the foetal development were observed in the absence of maternal toxicity. It was agreed that triflumuron has no specific neurotoxic potential.        Several tests were performed on metabolites and/or impurities. According to them, three impurities were considered toxicologically relevant, three plant metabolites were considered covered by the toxicological studies with the parent (use of the same reference value) but new toxicological data were required for the derivation of the acute reference dose for one acutely toxic plant metabolite. The agreed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for triflumuron is 0.014 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 1-year dog study supported by the 2-year rat study and with the use of a safety factor of 100. The agreed Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.036 mg/kg bw/day, based on the overall NOAEL of the 90-day rat studies and applying a safety factor of 100. The derivation of an Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not considered needed for the triflumuron, however it was agreed to require further data in order to derive an ARfD for the plant metabolite M07, since this metabolite was shown to be more acutely toxic        The agreed dermal absorption values resulting from in vivo and in vitro testing are 1% for the concentrate (mixing/loading) and 5% for the dilution (application). The estimated operator exposure levels according to the models are below the AOEL without the use of personal protective equipment, and the estimated exposure values for the workers and bystanders are even lower.        The plant metabolism of triflumuron was investigated in apples, potatoes and soybean. The study on apples was assessed by the RMS as having several deficiencies, and hence a new fruit metabolism study has been required to support the notified uses in pome fruit and stone fruit crops. The meeting of experts noted deficiencies also in the metabolism studies in potatoes and soybean and agreed that further data is necessary to conclude on a final plant residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring. Though the number and quality of the submitted residue trials was considered sufficient, the conducted trials do not determine all compounds included in the provisionally proposed residue definition for the risk assessment. In addition, further studies on the level of residues in processed fruit commodities are necessary to allow robust estimates of human and livestock dietary exposure to residues present following the use of triflumuron. Consequently, the assessment in terms of potential residues in food of animal origin including a residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment in animal products could not be finalised, neither could the consumer exposure and risk assessment be concluded. In addition, the need for further data to derive an ARfD was identified for 4-trifluoromethoxyaniline, a metabolite and degradation product of triflumuron that has been considered pertinent for the consumer risk assessment.        At the current stage, with the data available and eligible for evaluation it was only possible to provisionally propose residue definitions and MRLs for the notified uses. However, precise estimates of human and livestock dietary exposure, and finally a robust consumer risk assessment can only be finalised when the outstanding data and information will be evaluated.        Triflumuron is low to moderate persistent in soil (DT50 (lab 20 degrees C) = 6.9 - 52 d) under dark aerobic conditions. Two major metabolites are formed: 2-chlrobenzoic acid (M02, max. 23.5 % TRR; DT50(lab) (20 degrees C) = 1.2 - 4.2 d) and 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl urea (M08, TMPU, max. 23.1 % TRR; DT50(lab 20 degrees C) = 1.3 - 20.5 d). Trifluoromethoxyphenyl ring was less mineralized and more prone to form unextractable residues than the chlorophenyl ring. The range of pH in the soils investigated was too narrow with respect to the directive requirements. Therefore, a new data gap to address the rate of aerobic degradation of parent and formation and degradation rates of metabolites in alkaline soils was identified.        From the data available it was not possible to derive reliable half lives either for parent or for major soil metabolites under anaerobic conditions. Metabolites M2 (max 46.7 % AR) and M08 (max. 48.5 % AR) were the only major metabolites identified under dark anaerobic conditions. According the study available, triflumuron may be considered stable to photolysis in soil.        PEC soil calculations were presented in addendum 2 were accepted by the experts for the parent compound. However, new PEC soil calculations for metabolite M02 and M08 were requested. The new PEC soil have been calculated with the agreed input parameters and EFSA has presented the figures in the list of end points (a mistake was identified in the values calculated in addendum 3).        According available adsorption / desorption studies triflumuron may be considered immobile to low mobile in soil (Koc = 1629 - 30006 mL/g),metabolite M08 may be considered medium to high mobile in soil (Koc = 280 - 113 mL/g) and M02 may be considered very high mobile in soil (Koc = 4.0 - 8.8 mL/g). However, available data may only be considered relevant for acidic soils. Therefore, the experts identified a data gap for batch adsorption / desorption studies with more alkaline soils for parent and metabolite M02. The PRAPeR meeting of experts noted that these studies would eventually influence the results of PECGW and PECSW calculations and that these calculations may need to be revised.        Triflumuron was stable to hydrolysis at pH 5 and 7 and degrades with a half life between 29 and 57 d at pH 9. Main hydrolysis metabolites at this pH were M02 (max. 28.9 % AR after 30) and M08 (max. 48.8 % AR after 30 d). According the available study, aqueous photolysis is considered to contribute only in a minor extent to the overall degradation of triflumuron. In the lack of the corresponding study, it is proposed to classify triflumuron as not readily biodegradable.        In water sediment systems triflumuron partitioned to the sediment and degraded (DT50 = 4.1 - 7.1 d) to major metabolites M08 (max in water: 47.8 % AR after 14 d, max. in sed.: 20.4 % AR after 7 d; DT50 = 11.4 - 11.7 d) and M02 (max in water: 60.4 % AR after 14 d, max. in sed.: 7.9 % AR after 14 d; DT50 = 17.6 - 62.9 d). Mineralization was more important for the chlorophenyl ring than of the trifluoromethoxyphenyl moiety. The pH of the water phase of the systems investigated was in the alkaline range. A data gap, which was not considered essential to finalize the EU risk assessment, was identified for water / sediment studies within a wider range of pH values.        The meeting agreed that FOCUS PEC (SW / SED) presented in the DAR (including the Step 4 approach based on GIS) were not appropriate for the EU risk assessment. New FOCUS PECSW based on FOCUS kinetics were requested. New calculations provided in addendum 3 are not peer reviewed. EFSA considers that Step 2 calculations for metabolites are adequate for risk assessment. However, Step 3 and Step 4 calculations do not necessary represent worst case estimations. Step 3 single application calculations are still missing for the combination of input parameters agreed by the meeting.        Potential ground water contamination was addressed in the DAR by FOCUS PECGW calculations (80th percentile at 1 m depth) for triflumuron and its soil metabolites M02 and M08 with the FOCUS model PEARL and the nine FOCUS GW scenarios. Formation fraction of one had been assumed in these calculations for both soil metabolites M02 and M08. During the peer review data gaps have been identified for triflumuron and the metabolite M02 adsorption / desorption studies on more alkaline soils. Furthermore, rate of formation / degradation on alkaline soils needs to be investigated for triflumuron and both soil metabolites M02 and M08. Therefore, results of the available modelling are only relevant for acidic soils. Under these conditions neither the parent triflumuron nor any of the two soil metabolites M02 and M08 are expected to exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g / L.        The first-tier risk assessment for birds resulted in acute and short-term TERs above the Annex VI trigger of 10 but the long-term TER was below the trigger of 5. The refined long-term risk assessment was based on blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) as a focal species. A PT of 0.61 and a RUD of 5.1 (birds feeding only on large insects) was suggested to refine the risk assessment. The experts rejected the RUD refinement since no data supported the assumption that blue tits would feed only on large insects. The long-term TER was below the trigger of 5 on the basis of the agreed refinement steps and the revised long-term NOEC of 20 ppm. Therefore a data gap was identified in the expert meeting. The acute and long-term trigger values for mammals were exceeded in the first-tier risk assessment indicating a low risk. The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm- and fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low.        Triflumuron was very toxic to aquatic invertebrates. The acute and chronic TERs for daphnids were significantly below the Annex VI triggers of 100 and 10 for all FOCUS step 4 scenarios with a no-spray buffer zone of 30 m. A mesocosm study was submitted. The experts agreed on a regulatory endpoint of 0.1 mu g a.s./L in combination with an assessment factor of 3. A no-spray buffer zone of 30 m would not be sufficient to achieve TERs > 3. Further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment is needed. The risk to adult bees was low but bee brood was very sensitive to exposure to triflumuron (insect growth regulator). Exposure of bees was considered to take place via flowering weeds in the orchards. Increased mortality of pupae was observed at an application rate relevant for exposure on weeds. It was further noted that the second application was not covered by the field studies. It was not sufficiently demonstrated that the risk to bee brood development was low and risk mitigation measures such as cutting flowering weeds in the treated field were suggested to protect bees. Chrysoperla carnea was the most sensitive non-target arthropod species tested. This observation was confirmed in a field study in an apple orchard. Full recovery of affected arthropod populations (including the most sensitive species C. carnea) was observed. The study provided some evidence that a sufficiently high number of Chrysoperla larvae could survive in the untreated area to allow recolonisation of the treated in-field area. Overall it was concluded that the risk to non-target arthropods was sufficiently addressed for the representative uses evaluated. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. No long-term studies were conducted with earthworms. Since triflumuron inhibits the chitin synthesis the experts considered the potential adverse long-term effects on earthworms necessary to be investigated and therefore a data gap was identified. No studies with other soil non- target macro-organisms were made available for triflumuron. The experts agreed in the meeting that studies with collembola should be conducted considering the high toxicity to arthropods and that the DT90 can be longer than 100 days under some soil conditions.        The risk to soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on paraffin oil (CAS 8042-47-5) in accordance with the provisions of Article 21(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 7 May 2008. The peer review was initiated on 30 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Stahler International GmbH&Co.KG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide and acaricide for use on pome fruit, stone fruit, grapes and ornamentals. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of endpoints.        The representative formulated products for the evaluation were 'Para Sommer', it is currently not clear what the formulation type is and a data gap is set to address this.        Methods of analysis for food items are currently not required see section 3. For environmental matrices methods are not required for groundwater and air, for surface water a method is required for alkanes (chain lengths up to C31). For soil it is not concluded if a method is required or not, see sections 4 and 5.        Sufficient internationally accepted methods (e.g. ASTM and ISO) are available to characterise the technical material and formulated product. However, at this time the technical specification is not accepted, the method of manufacture is not known and there is no supporting batch data. Data gaps have been identified for vapour pressure and auto-flammability of the technical paraffin oil. For the formulation, data gaps have been identified for flash point and emulsion stability after shelf-life storage.        During the mammalian toxicology meeting, as no technical specification was agreed by the meeting on physical and chemical properties, concerns were raised over relevant impurities generally associated with these compounds. While it is not demonstrated that no concern is raised due to the impurity profile of the substance, paraffin oil has to be classified as T ""Toxic"", carcinogenic category 2, R45 ""May cause cancer"". On this basis, no toxicological studies were required, no ADI, AOEL or ARfD were proposed and no risk assessment of operator, worker and bystander exposure could be conducted, as the experts considered that these specifications were not acceptable from the toxicological point of view.        It was noted however, that if highly purified paraffin oils were considered (i.e. no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the active substance), then no toxicological concern would be raised for consumers, operators, workers and bystanders. Sources of mineral oil are laxatives in pharmacy, or oils used in food technology as release agents, for lubrication purposes, or as a substitute for fat. Paraffin oils are chemically inert substances, especially the straight chain (n) alkanes and on ingestion most of the mineral oil (about 98% depending on the length of the C-chain) remains unabsorbed and is rapidly excreted, mostly unchanged, via faeces.        Paraffin oil has a low toxicity profile. No toxicological study was submitted or accepted. The experts agreed that no short term, long term, genotoxicity, or reproductive toxicity studies would be required, provided that no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the substance; paraffin oils are not considered to be genotoxic, carcinogenic, neurotoxic or toxic to reproduction. Also in line with the low toxicity of paraffin oils (of high purity), no ADI, AOEL or ARfD would be proposed, nor considered necessary, and no risk assessment for operators, workers and bystanders would be required.        The list of endpoints on mammalian toxicology has been filled in considering that the technical material does not contain unacceptable levels of relevant impurities.        No information on potential levels of residues in food or feed items were presented in the DAR. A consumer risk assessment has not been performed due to the possible high level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. If these compounds are present then it would result in a toxicological classification that would mean that these compounds could not be registered as Plant Protection Products. The risk to consumers can therefore not be finalised.        In soil under aerobic conditions this paraffin oil mixture exhibits moderate to medium persistence in terms of the time taken for carbon tetrachloride extracted alkanes to be mineralised. The alkanes in the mixture are classed as immobile in soil, on the basis of QSAR estimates and adsorption is not pH dependent. In a 55 cm deep microcosm study this paraffin oil mixture formed a layer at the water surface (spray application made), where it dissipated rapidly exhibiting low persistence in water. Sediment concentrations were not measured. The mechanism of the dissipation was not identified. Surface water exposure assessments are available using the SWASH drift calculator tool. A data gap is identified regarding the potential for water body associated sediment to be exposed and information on degradation/dissipation potential of this paraffin oil mixture in sediment. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by alkanes up to C31 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        Based on the available data, paraffin oil was proposed to be classified as toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute risk of paraffin oil to fish was assessed as low for all the relevant scenarios. Risk mitigation measures equivalent to 25m, 3m and 1m no-spray buffer zones were necessary to refine the risk for aquatic invertebrates and alga for the pome-fruit, grapevines and ornamental uses. The available information did not allow the risk to sediment dwelling organisms to be assessed.        Standard laboratory tests were conducted with the formulation 'Para Sommer' and the species Coccinella septempunctata (0 % effects on mortality; 58 % fecundity) and Phytoseidus permisilis on the leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris (69 % of mortality). Two extended laboratory studies with the standard indicator species Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri were submitted. The in-field HQ values were above the Annex VI trigger values, however the off-field HQs were below the triggers. Therefore, the in-field risk should be further addressed and risk mitigation measures should be considered.        Data gaps were identified after the peer review by EFSA to address the risk to soil non-target micro-organisms and to soil non-target macro-organisms.        The risk to birds and mammals, bees (with mitigation to avoid direct spraying of bees), nontarget plants, and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

rayyan-1227191422,CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance tebufenpyrad Reissued on 23 October 2008,2009,3,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,3,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Tebufenpyrad is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tebufenpyrad in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 12 March 2007. The peer review was initiated on 6 February 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June-July 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as acaricide, insecticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying in pome fruit for the control of mite pests on all developmental stages of mites. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""BAS 31806I"" (""MASAI""), a wettable powder (WP) containing 200 g/kg tebufenpyrad.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The specification cannot be finalised as there are outstanding issues. Also a shelf-life study and a new suspensibility study have been identified as data gaps.        Adequate methods are available to monitor tebufenpyrad residues in food/feed of plant origin and environmental matrices.        Mammalian toxicology of tebufenpyrad was assessed in a series of tests. Tebufenpyrad is absorbed extensively but slowly. It is widely distributed and has no potential for accumulation. It is excreted slowly but completely and is rapidly and extensively metabolized. It is of moderate toxicity by the oral and the inhalation route and of low toxicity by the dermal route. Tebufenpyrad is neither irritant to skin nor to the eyes but is a skin sensitizer. Based on the available data on acute toxicity a classification as Xn; R20 (""Harmful; Harmful by inhalation""), Xn; R22 (""Harmful; Harmful if swallowed"") and Xi; R43 (""Irritant; May cause sensitization by skin contact"") is proposed.        In short term tests with tebufenpyrad effects on bodyweight and food consumption were observed in all species tested (rat, mouse, dog and rabbit). While in rats and mice the liver was the target of toxicity, in dogs gastrointestinal effects and lesions were prevalent. The lowest no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was achieved in the rat (0.7 mg/kg bw/day). In dogs an overall NOAEL of 2 mg/kg bw/day was set. Tebufenpyrad is not genotoxic. A 2-year rat study and an 18-month study with mice were reported. In the rat study a systemic NOAEL of 0.8 mg/kg bw/day was derived based on effects on bodyweight and food consumption, altered erythrocyte parameters, and liver effects. The liver adenomas observed were considered not relevant for human risk assessment. In the mouse study a NOAEL of 3.6 mg/kg bw/day was derived based on increased liver and kidney weights, and reduced bodyweight and food consumption. No tumours were observed. Tebufenpyrad did not cause specific effects on reproduction in a two-generation study. While no effects on development were observed in rabbits, in rats increased incidences of supernumerary ribs were seen at maternally toxic doses.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) were set at 0.01 mg/kg bw/day. An acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.02 mg/kg bw was allocated.        Using the German model operator exposure amounted to 65% (tractor-mounted application) and to 92% (hand-held application) of the AOEL when personal protective equipment (PPE) was used. In the UK POEM exposure exceeded the AOEL in all scenarios. Worker exposure was calculated to be 57% of the AOEL when PPE is used. A refined exposure assessment after the PRAPeR meeting of experts showed a bystander exposure of 93% of the systemic AOEL.        The metabolism of tebufenpyrad in apples was investigated. Application was made at a rate of 2.22 kg a.s./ha which is a 22N rate. Some minor metabolites were identified but given that the study was conducted at such a high rate the only significant residue will be tebufenpyrad. The residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment is therefore tebufenpyrad only. Sufficient residue trials were supplied for the critical GAP in the north and south of Europe. Residues of tebufenpyrad were stable under freezer storage for a period of at least two years. On processing, the nature of the residue will be unchanged, and sufficient data were supplied to derive processing factors for juice and pomace. Metabolism data in goat and hen were provided; the most significant residues were tebufenpyrad, CL 810,7202 and CL 810,721(3). In a ruminant feeding study, even at 3N, significant residues of tebufenpyrad as well as these two metabolites were not found. Also at the 10N rate, only very low levels were found. The meeting of experts concluded that there will be no significant residues present in products of animal origin. The residue definition was therefore set as tebufenpyrad for monitoring and risk assessment for ruminant only. The meeting noted however, that this should be considered again if other uses lead to higher intakes. No conclusion was reached on the residue definition for poultry. However, the notified uses would not give rise to significant residues in poultry as there is no dietary exposure. The risk assessment showed that maximum intakes are 28 % of the ADI and 64 % of the ARfD. An MRL for pome fruit was set at 0.2 mg/kg.        In soil under aerobic conditions tebufenpyrad exhibits moderate to medium persistence forming the major soil metabolite CL 810,721 (accounting for up to 23% of applied radioactivity (AR)), which exhibits low to moderate persistence, and the minor non-transient metabolite CL 810,7284 (accounting for up to 5.1 % AR). Mineralisation of both the benzene- and pyrazole rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 16% AR and 9.2-43.9% AR, respectively, after 120-122 days. The formation of unextractable residues accounted for 3.5 % AR and 2.5-35.5% AR, respectively, after 120-122 days. Photolysis studies with tebufenpyrad on soil revealed CL 810,7295 to be the major photo- degradation product accounting for up to 12% AR. Tebufenpyrad is immobile to low mobile in soil; CL 810,721 and CL 810,729 exhibit high to very high mobility in soil, and CL 810,728 is very highly mobile. There was no indication that adsorption of tebufenpyrad, CL 810,728 and CL 810,729 were pH-dependent, whilst sorption of CL 810,721 was clearly dependent on pH in soil.        In dark natural sediment water systems tebufenpyrad partitioned rapidly from water to sediment, where the metabolite CL 810,721 was formed at maximum 16.5% of AR in the water phase. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for tebufenpyrad up to step 4, step 3 for metabolite CL 810,728 and step 2 for metabolites CL 810,721 and CL 810,729. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by tebufenpyrad and its metabolites CL 810,721, CL 810,728 and CL 810,729 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations, that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        The acute and short-term risk to birds and the acute and long-term risk to mammals were assessed as low in a first-tier risk assessment. The long-term (reproductive) endpoint for birds was discussed by the experts. A long-term NOEL of 6.6 mg a.s./kg bw/day was agreed based on effects on reduced number of hatchlings, eggs laid and 14-day old survivors at the higher tested concentrations. The first-tier long-term TER was below the Annex VI trigger of 5. The refined risk assessment based on the agreed PD (proportion of different food types) resulted still in a TER below 5, and a data gap was identified to further refine the long-term risk to insectivorous birds. The risk to earthworm-and fish-eating birds was assessed as low.        Tebufenpyrad was very toxic to fish and to aquatic invertebrates with steep dose-response curves. All FOCUS step 4 scenarios resulted in acute TERs > 100 for daphnids, if a no-spray buffer zone of 20m was applied. However, no full FOCUS step 4 scenario resulted in TERs above the Annex VI trigger for fish. The risk assessment for fish was refined by HC5 (hazard concentration of the 5th percentile of the species distribution) calculation based on five species. The experts suggested using the lower limit HC5 (95% tile lower confidence limit) of 6.1 mu g a.s./L together with a reduced safety factor of 10. The trigger was exceeded in all FOCUS step 4 scenarios with a no-spray buffer zone of 20m. The long-term risk assessment for invertebrates was based on a population development study with daphnids (NOEC of 4 mu g a.s./L). The Annex VI trigger of 10 was exceeded in the full scenarios D3, D4, R1, R4 and the part scenario D5 (pond), but was below the trigger in the full scenarios R2, R3 and the part scenario D5 (stream), if a 20m no-spray buffer zone was applied. The risk from the major metabolites in water and soil was assessed as low. The maximum bioconcentration factor (BCF) for fish, normalised to the lipid content, was 953. Tebufenpyrad was rapidly metabolised and excreted with a clearance time CT90 of 1.65 days. It is applied only once per year and it dissipates rapidly from the water phase. Therefore it was concluded, that the risk from bioconcentration and bioaccumulation is low. The risk to sediment-dwelling organisms was assessed as low.        T. pyri was the most sensitive arthropod species tested. A potential for high in-field and off-field risk was indicated in the first-tier risk assessment. In higher tier (extended laboratory) tests it was shown that the off-field risk to T. pyri is low. Recolonisation of the in-field area was considered as plausible, since effects were <50% after 14 days of ageing of residues.        The risk to bees, earthworms, other soil macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

rayyan-1227191423,CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance teflubenzuron Issued on 29 September 2008,2009,1,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,1,,EFSA,,English,,,"Teflubenzuron is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on teflubenzuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 6 August 2007. The peer review was initiated on 26 November 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF Agro BV. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the notifier which comprise foliar spraying in apple and indoor tomatoes for the control of codling moth, leafminers, whiteflies and caterpillars. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Nomolt"", a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 150 g/l teflubenzuron.        The minimum purity of teflubenzuron could not be concluded on as with the data available no specification could be set.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        There are methods available to monitor teflubenzuron residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin, soil and water, however data gaps were identified for confirmatory method(s) for the determination of teflubenzuron from plant matrices, from soil and from drinking and surface water. An analytical method to determine teflubenzuron residues in surface water with an LOQ of 0.0025 mu g/l and a primary method for the determination of teflubenzuron from air with an LOQ of 1.8 mu g/m(3) are missing.        In the mammalian metabolism studies, teflubenzuron was rapidly but only partially absorbed after oral administration. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation; teflubenzuron was eliminated mainly unchanged via faeces. The acute toxicity was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route and no eye or skin irritation was observed. As the study on skin sensitisation was not considered acceptable by the experts, classification of teflubenzuron with R43, may cause sensitization by skin contact, was proposed. The main target organ of teflubenzuron was the liver upon short term or long term exposure in either the rat, mouse or dog species; the relevant NOAEL for short term exposure was the dose level of 8.0 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day rat feeding study; only a LOAEL could be derived from the long term studies due to slight hepatotoxicity found at 2.1 mg/kg bw/day in the 18-month oncogenicity study in mouse. Benign hepatocellular adenomas observed only in this mouse study were not considered relevant for human exposure. There was no evidence for genotoxic or neurotoxic potential related to teflubenzuron administration; no effect on the reproduction, fertility or development was observed. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of teflubenzuron was 0.01 mg/kg bw/day based on the LOAEL from the 18-month study in mouse and applying a safety factor of 200; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.016 mg/kg bw/day based on the oral 90-day rat study, a safety factor of 100 and a correction factor of 20 % for low oral absorption; no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Dermal absorption was 2 % for the concentrate representative formulation and 20 % for the in-use spray dilution. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation Nomolt, at a maximum dose rate of 0.120 kg teflubenzuron/ha in apples and of 0.225 kg teflubenzuron/ha in protected tomatoes was below the AOEL, when the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was considered. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with teflubenzuron was below the AOEL, either if the dermal absorption assumption is based on the value obtained with the concentrate formulation or, alternatively, if PPE are worn. Bystander, residential and exposure of small children playing on a lawn contaminated with fallout from spray drift containing Nomolt were all estimated to be below the AOEL.        Concerning residues, the metabolism of teflubenzuron was investigated in apples, potatoes and a further study on spinach which was not regarded as acceptable by the PRAPeR meeting of experts. The major component in the crops at harvest was unmetabolised teflubenzuron. The experts requested new metabolism studies on rotational crops to support the use of teflubenzuron on tomatoes grown in glass houses on soil based systems, because the submitted studies were under dosed. Therefore, only a provisional residue definition could be proposed. Currently only the use of teflubenzuron on protected tomatoes is sufficiently supported by residue trials to set a provisional MRL. The PRAPeR meeting of experts followed the RMS's suggestion and set a data gap for residue trials on cherry tomatoes to cover fully the notified use on tomatoes. For the use on apples a data gap for further residue trials was identified. Sufficient processing studies on tomatoes were submitted to calculate transfer factors. Further processing studies are required for apples.        The metabolism study on goats and the animal transfer studies on dairy cattle require further investigation and the PRAPeR meeting of experts proposed a data gap for a new metabolism study and data on storage stability in animal products. Depending on the results of the metabolism study further studies on livestock might be required. Therefore, only provisional residue definitions for animal products were proposed. Intake calculations for livestock, which are required to support the notified use on apples, can only be carried out when the additional data on livestock and apple processing studies are available.        The consumer risk assessment and the MRL proposals cannot be finalised. On the basis of a provisional intake calculation for tomatoes only, the consumer exposure is expected to be below the ADI.        Teflubenzuron is moderate to high persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions (DT50 = 30.4 - 151.5 d) and yields 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenylurea as a major metabolite. Another metabolite, 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluoroaniline, exceeded 5 % in two non consecutive data points. After consultation with the experts on toxicology, a data gap to address ground water exposure for this metabolite has been identified.        Reliable kinetic parameters (formation and degradation rate constants) for the major metabolite 3,5-dichloro-2,4-dichlorophenylurea were not available and the PRAPeR meeting of experts identified a data gap for these parameters. The ground water exposure assessment may need to be subsequently updated.        Degradation was faster under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic ones in the experiment available where the rest of conditions are maintained. However, anaerobic conditions are not considered to be especially relevant for the representative uses (tomato and apple) evaluated at EU level. Photolysis does not significantly contribute to the environmental degradation of teflubenzuron in soil under EU realistic conditions.        Four field dissipation studies are available, which allow appropriately deriving the dissipation half lives for PEC soil calculations. However, the PRAPeR meeting of experts identified a new data gap for a new kinetic evaluation of field dissipation study for its use in environmental modelling. This data gap was not considered essential to finalise the EU risk assessment.        PEC soil of teflubenzuron was calculated in the DAR for the use in apples (outdoor) based on the worst case field half live of 16.4 days. For the metabolites 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenylurea, 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluoroaniline the peak maximum PEC soil was calculated based on the maximum formations observed in the laboratory studies.        According to the available studies teflubenzuron may be considered immobile in soil (K-OC = 21 139 32 556 mL / g) and the metabolite 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenylurea may be considered to exhibit low mobility in soil (KOC = 942 - 1720 mL / g).        In water teflubenzuron is stable at pH 5 and 7 and hydrolyses with a DT50 = 8.7 d at pH 9. The metabolite 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenylurea is expected to be stable to hydrolysis in the normal range of environmental conditions.        The RMS estimated an aqueous photolysis half-life of 13.7 days (40 degrees N, continuous irradiation) on basis of the available study. RMS considered that photolysis would not contribute significantly to the environmental degradation of teflubenzuron under realistic conditions for the representative uses. Teflubenzuron was not readily biodegradable according the available study.        Dissipation / degradation of teflubenzuron was investigated in two dark aerobic water/sediment systems. In both systems, teflubenzuron partitioned to the sediment and degraded (DT50whole system = 11 - 21.4 d) to form the major metabolites 5-chloro-2,4-difluoroaniline (UNK 5 in the DAR), 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenyl-urea, 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluoroaniline and 2,6-difluorobenzoic acid. The applicant provided PECSW/SED calculations based on FOCUS Step 1 and Step 2 for the metabolites 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenylurea, 3,5-dichloro-2,4difluoroaniline, 2,6-difluorobenzoic acid and 5-chloro-2,4-difluoroaniline for the use in apples.        For the parent teflubenzuron PECSW/SED values were calculated with FOCUS scheme up to Step 4 considering up to 100 m spray drift buffer zone for the use in apples. It is noted that this buffer zone represents a 99.6 % mitigation when compared with Step 3 (above the 95 % mitigation deemed as practicable by the FOCUS Landscape and Mitigation guidance document).        For the greenhouse use in tomatoes the RMS provided indicative parent PECSW value of 0.0225 mg/L based on 0.1 % losses to surface water (Dutch model). However, the RMS also indicated that from the ecotoxicology assessment the total loss from glasshouse should be 0.00001 % only. To attain this low level, glasshouses would have to operate with negligible emissions of teflubenzuron. With the available information, it is not possible to assess if measures that actually achieve these low levels of emission rates are practicable. Therefore, EFSA proposed a critical area of concern for the aquatic environment with respect to the uses in green house.        The PRAPeR meeting of experts considered for teflubenzuron that the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L is not expected to be exceeded for the representative use in apples.        No PECGW calculations are available for metabolite 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluoroaniline. The need to address the potential ground water contamination by this metabolite has been identified after consultation with the PRAPeR meeting of experts on toxicology. No groundwater assessment is available for the greenhouse use. Therefore, the assessment presented is considered only to address situations were plants are grown on artificial substrate or on hydroponics. On basis of its properties long term transport of teflubenzuron through the atmosphere is not expected to be of concern.        The acute and short term risk to birds and the acute and long term risk to mammals were concluded to be low in a first-tier assessment. No valid long term endpoint (reproductive toxicity) was available for birds and therefore, a data gap was identified for a suitable chronic study. The risk to earthworm and fish-eating mammals was considered low.        Teflubenzuron is highly toxic to aquatic organisms. A lower acute toxicity to fish was observed when formulated. Water/sediment metabolites were less toxic than the active substance and thus considered as not ecotoxicologically relevant. The most sensitive organisms tested were aquatic invertebrates. These effects were addressed by higher tier studies. A NOEC = 0.005 mu g a.s./L from a mesocosm study and an assessment factor (AF) of 2 was agreed by the PRAPeR meeting of experts. The first-tier risk assessment indicated a potential high risk to aquatic organisms. For the outdoor use on apples, FOCUS step 4 scenarios only resulted in toxicity exposure ratios (TERs) above the trigger values for fish and algae if a no-spray buffer zone of 16 m was included in the calculations. None of the FOCUS step 4 scenarios resulted in TERs above the triggers for invertebrates, even including a no-spray buffer of 100 m and taking into account the higher tier study. For the application on greenhouse tomatoes, TERs based on the Dutch model PEC values were below the Annex VI triggers, except those related to the formulated product for fish (acute) and for algae. As mentioned above, a total loss percentage from glasshouses as low as 0.00001% would be needed to be achieve a low risk. Since during the peer review no mitigation measures were assessed which could allow the achievement of such negligible emissions, a potential high risk to aquatic organisms from greenhouse uses cannot be excluded. A data gap was suggested for further refinements.        A low risk to adult bees was identified. A potential high risk to hive development was not excluded, as clear effects on the bee population reduction were observed at tested rates lower than the GAP. Therefore, a data gap was suggested to further address the risk to bees for the outdoor use. For the glasshouse use the risk to bee population was expected to be low. However the risk to introduced pollinators might need to be managed. A high risk for non-target-arthropods was identified for the in-field exposure scenario and a no-spray buffer zone of 15 m would be needed to meet the trigger of 2 for the off-field scenario. The oral uptake was considered by the RMS a major route of exposure. The submitted data as well as the ESCORT2 approach did not address this route of exposure. A data gap was identified to further address the risk to non-target arthropods (i.e. a field study), considering the mode of action of the active substance and the potential for recovery.        Since teflubenzuron is a chitin synthesis inhibitor, a data gap was identified for a chronic study on earthworms, even if the acute risk was assessed as low and the DT50 in soil was lower than 100 d.        The risk to other soil macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

rayyan-1227191424,CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bensulfuron Issued on 26 September 2008,2009,1,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,1,,EFSA,,English,,,"Bensulfuron is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within 6 months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bensulfuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 11 September 2006. The peer review was initiated on 24 November 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant United Phosphorus Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on rice for the control of broad-leaved weeds and Cyperaceae as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Londax (R), a water-dispersible granule (WG) containing 600 g/kg of bensulfuron-methyl which is a variant of bensulfuron(2).        The technical specification is not finalised, a data gap was identified for a revised specification. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor bensulfuron-methyl residues in food/feed of plant origin, soil, surface water and air; however no monitoring methods were submitted for the metabolites set as part of the residue definition in ground water. An analytical method for food of animal origin is not required due to the fact that no residue definition is proposed.        In the mammalian metabolism studies, bensulfuron-methyl was rapidly but incompletely absorbed after oral administration. It was distributed mainly to the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidneys and plasma and was extensively metabolised, showing no potential for accumulation. The acute toxicity was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route; no eye or skin irritation was observed and no skin sensitisation potential was found in a Magnusson & Kligman test. The main target organ of bensulfuron-methyl was the liver upon short term or long term exposure in either the rat, mouse or dog species; the relevant NOAEL for both short term and long term exposure was the dose level of 19.9 mg/kg bw/day from the one-year dog study. No potential for neurotoxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenicity was seen with bensulfuron-methyl; no reproductive or fertility effects were observed in a two-generation reproduction toxicity study. Some unspecific effects or delay in the development of rats were observed upon high dosing of bensulfuron-methyl without expressing maternal toxicity, in rabbits only decreased body weight was observed at maternal toxic doses.        The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of bensulfuron-methyl was 0.2 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study, applying a safety factor of 100; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.12 mg/kg bw/day based on the same 1-year dog study, safety factor of 100, and applying a correction factor of 60 % for low oral absorption; no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Dermal absorption was 5.9 % for the concentrate representative formulation and 7.2 % for the in-use spray dilution, based on an in vivo study in rat. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation Londax (R) (a water dispersible granule (WG) formulation containing 600 g/kg of bensulfuron-methyl), at a maximum dose rate of 0.06 kg bensulfuron-methyl/ha in rice was below the AOEL according to the UK POEM, only when the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) as gloves during mixing/loading and application was considered; according to the German model, estimated exposure was below the AOEL even when no PPE were worn. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with bensulfuron-methyl was below the AOEL, without the use of PPE. Bystander exposure was low compared to the AOEL value.        In metabolism studies with radio labelled bensulfuron-methyl in paddy rice, upon application to the water surface, levels of total radioactivity recovered in rice plants were very low and hence identification of residues was limited to the extractable radioactivity from foliage and straw. Neither intact bensulfuron-methyl nor bensulfuron was detected, but, though at very low levels, some metabolites could be identified that indicate a cleavage of the sulfonylurea bridge occurred. In the meeting of experts the need for further data on the nature of the residue in plants with foliar exposure and in rotational crops was identified. Therefore a residue definition for risk assessment and MRL setting purposes could only be proposed provisionally as bensulfuron-methyl.        Residue trials with post-emergence application to rice plants indicate that under practical conditions, residues of bensulfuron-methyl above the limit of quantification (LOQ) are not expected in rice grain, while in rice straw residues above the LOQ could be found in one trial.        In a confined rotational crop study total residues in the rotated crops did not exceed 0.01 mg/kg, however data indicated an increase of residues in rotated cereals with time and thus clarification on potential uptake of soil metabolites is required.        No significant residues are expected to occur in commodities to be processed or used in livestock diet, and therefore no further investigation in processing studies and livestock studies is required to support the representative uses in rice.        In a provisional chronic consumer exposure and risk assessment, based on the provisional residue definition for risk assessment, it was demonstrated that the maximum estimated dietary intake of residues of bensulfuron-methyl is well below (<1%) the toxicological reference value ADI. As no ARfD was allocated an acute risk assessment is not considered necessary. Based on the available environmental fate and behaviour studies in aerobic soil and aerobic natural sediment water systems it was identified that bensulfuron-methyl and the breakdown products IN-F78803 (max 9.7% applied radioactivity (AR) in whole natural sediment water systems), bensulfuron (max 27.7% AR in soil), IN-J02904(max 46% AR in soil), IN-N52975 (max 31.7% AR in whole natural sediment water systems), IN-DAT976 (max 9.9% AR in whole natural sediment water systems) and IN-D1R847 (max 18.2% AR in soil) needed environmental exposure assessments. In a sterilised natural water (indirect) aqueous photolysis study IN-T58318 was formed at up to 13.7% AR. An environmental exposure assessment was also completed for this metabolite. These observed formation fractions were used as the basis for calculating the available environmental exposure assessments. Bensulfuron-methyl was characterised as exhibiting moderate to high persistence, IN-F7880 low to medium persistence, bensulfuron low to moderate persistence, IN-J0290 low to moderate persistence, IN-N5297 low to medium persistence, IN-T5831 no data available but considered to have moderate persistence on the basis of structural similarity to IN-J0290, IN-DAT97 moderate persistence and IN-D1R84 low to moderate persistence.        Mineralisation of both the phenyl and pyrimidine rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 12-39% AR after 95-119 days and 2-25% AR after 95-119 days respectively in the available aerobic studies. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 11-37 % AR (same radiolabels, results amalgamated) after 95-119 days in these studies. A data gap was identified for experimental data on the route and rate of degradation of bensulfuron-methyl under aerobic flooded soil conditions (that needs to include alkali soil conditions).        Bensulfuron-methyl was characterised as exhibiting medium to low mobility, IN-F7880 high to medium mobility, bensulfuron very high to low mobility, IN-J0290 high to low mobility, IN-N5297 very high to high mobility, and IN-D1R84 very high mobility. For IN-T5831 and IN-DAT97 no experimental data were available and a data gap was identified. The environmental exposure assessment was completed assuming that these two compounds (IN-T5831 and IN-DAT97) exhibited very high mobility. Using this assumption the assessment indicated that mitigation to reduce the potential for the exposure of groundwater may be necessary for these two metabolites for one of the applied for intended uses in situations represented by the MED-Rice sand groundwater scenario.        The information available was insufficient to enable a satisfactory environmental exposure assessment to be completed in line with agreed MED-Rice (2003) guidance(9), due to the data gaps identified above. A triggered higher tier exposure assessment for bensulfuron-methyl regarding natural surface water and sediment for situations represented by the MED-Rice sand soil scenario and for all scenarios where application is made before sowing the rice crop is missing. Whilst a higher tier exposure assessment regarding natural surface water and sediment for situations represented by the MED-Rice clay soil scenario for bensulfuron-methyl and post planting applications is available, the Member State experts did not accept the soil DT50 used as input (field dissipation value) to the RICEWQ module of the simulations or the way the exposure concentrations (90th percentile 14 day TWA values) provided by the applicant had been calculated. The experts agreed that there was a data gap for 90th percentile 14 day TWA values to be represented in a way that has some meaning for an edge of field risk assessment. The approach used by the applicant in the available assessment mixed temporal and spatial factors in an inappropriate way, such that the resulting aquatic risk assessment does not demonstrate in which (if any) situations the active substance might be used without impacting on populations of aquatic species, which is what Member State experts agreed would be required to demonstrate compliance with annex VI criteria.        It can be concluded that the potential for bensulfuron-methyl to contaminate vulnerable groundwater above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L from the applied for intended uses is low. For the known metabolites, based on the available data, there are indications that this is also the case when applications are made to paddies with a 10cm layer of water overlying the soil and for shallower paddy water depths in situations represented by the MED-Rice clay scenario. However in situations represented by the MED-Rice sand scenario where applications are made to paddies with <10cm overlying water it cannot be excluded with the available data that IN-5297, IN-T5831 and IN-DAT97 may be present in vulnerable groundwater at > 0. 1 mu g/L (calculations indicate concentrations up to 0.23 mu g/L). Therefore a non relevance assessment for these three metabolites was triggered, but these are not available. In the absence of data to assess the non relevance of these metabolites, the available groundwater exposure assessments indicate that risk management options may be effective at mitigating the potential for groundwater exposure by these metabolites in regions represented by the MED-Rice sand scenario. However the groundwater assessment for metabolites cannot be finalised until the data gap for experimental data on the route and rate of degradation of bensulfuron-methyl under aerobic flooded soil conditions (that needs to include alkali soil conditions) has been filled.        Bensulfuron-methyl is used as a herbicide and it is very toxic to aquatic and terrestrial plants. A low risk to the aquatic environment (algae and macrophytes) was not demonstrated using the submitted data and further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment is needed. The risk to non-target terrestrial plants in the off-field area needs to be mitigated. Risk mitigation comparable to an in-field no-spray buffer zone of 5 m is required to protect non-target terrestrial plants.        The risk to birds, mammals, fish and aquatic invertebrates, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro- and micro-organisms, and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated.

The antioxidant roles of selenium (Se) were evaluated in Brycon cephalus exposed to 2 mg L-1 of Folisuper 600 BR (R) (MP commercial formulation - MPc, 600 g L-1) for 96 h. Catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels in the gills, white muscle and liver were evaluated in fish fed on diets containing 0 or 1.5 mg Se kg(-1) for 8 weeks. in fish treated with a Se-free diet, the MPc exposure increased SOD and CAT activities in all tissues. However, the GPx activity decreased in white muscle and gills whereas no alterations were observed in the liver. MPc also increased CST activity in all tissues with a concurrent decrease in GSH levels. LPO values increased in white muscle and gills and did not change in liver after MPc exposure. A Se-supplemented diet reversed these findings, preventing increases in LPO levels and concurrent decreases in GPx activity in gills and white muscle. Similarly, GSH levels were maintained in all tissue after MPc exposure. These results suggest that dietary Se supplementation protects cells against MPc-induced oxidative stress.

rayyan-1227191426,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Aclonifen,2008,10,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,10,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Aclonifen is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on aclonifen in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 11 September 2006. The peer review was initiated on 24 November 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March-April 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in June-July 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a pre emergence herbicide as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Bandar"", a suspension concentrate formulation (SC).        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of aclonifen.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The exception to this is the relevant impurity phenol where there is no method to monitor it in the formulation. It was concluded during the peer review process that the specification is not supported and a data gap has been identified. In addition it was considered by the meeting of experts mammalian toxicology that phenol is a relevant impurity. The meeting of experts discussed that as the technical material is a wet cake a TK specification should be required but no conclusion was reached on this in the meeting.        Mammalian toxicology of aclonifen was assessed in a series of investigations. Aclonifen is absorbed rapidly to an extent of about 80% and is distributed widely in the body. It has no potential for accumulation. It is excreted rapidly and almost completely and it is extensively metabolised. Aclonifen is of very low acute toxicity. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant but has skin sensitising properties. A classification as Xi; R43 ""Irritant; May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" is proposed. Short term studies were carried out with dogs, mice and rats and the lowest NOAEL of 3.6 mg/kg bw/d was obtained in rats (effects on body weight, liver and kidney). Aclonifen is not genotoxic. Two chronic rat studies and a carcinogenicity study with mice have been carried out. While the thyroid tumours seen in rats and the bladder tumours observed in mice were considered not relevant for human risk assessment the brain tumours seen in the rat could not be dismissed and a classification as Xn; Carc. Cat. 3 R40 ""Harmful; Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"" was proposed. Aclonifen did not exert specific effects on reproduction and was neither teratogenic in rats nor in rabbits. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) were set at 0.07 mg/kg bw/d. An acute reference dose (ARfD) was not allocated. Operator exposure amounted to 16.1% of the AOEL when wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) in the German model. When no PPE is worn in the German model and in all scenarios in the UK POEM exposures exceeded the AOEL. Exposure of bystanders and unprotected re-entry workers was estimated to amount to 4.6% and 2.9% of the AOEL respectively.        The metabolism of aclonifen was investigated in wheat, peas and potatoes. However in the meeting of experts PRAPeR 45 no conclusion could be reached on the cereal and potato metabolism studies because there were no GAPs for these crops in the representative uses evaluated. So only the pea study was considered further. The pea study is representative of the relevant metabolism group for sunflowers which is the supported crop. This study showed that there are no significant residues in peas or in podded peas the major residue in the vinings was aclonifen. The residue definition for pulses and oilseeds was set as aclonifen only. The rotational crop metabolism study showed that in the majority of crops no significant residues would occur. However, for root and tuber crops it showed that residues could be expected. A data gap was set for a rotational crop residue study. The need for animal studies was not triggered. A goat metabolism study was evaluated in the DAR but the peer review did not conclude on its acceptability. A full set a residue data were available for the north and south of Europe all residues were <0.02 mg/kg at harvest. The consumer risk assessment could not be concluded because of the data gap identified for rotational crops. A risk assessment based on intakes of sunflower showed that the TMDI did not exceed 1 % of the ADI, no acute risk assessment was necessary.        The route of degradation in soil under dark aerobic conditions was investigated in two studies in a total of five soils. Albeit the drawbacks identified in these studies, the meeting of experts agreed that the data submitted was enough to satisfy the regulatory requirements. Practically the totality of the extracted radioactivity consisted on parent compound with only very minor metabolites detected. Mineralization was negligible or very low (CO2: 0.7 5.2 % AR). Unextracted soil residue increase continuously up to 40.9 63.7 % AR at the end of the experiments. According the photolysis in soil study, photolysis may contribute slightly to the degradation of aclonifen in soil. No metabolite exceeded 5 % AR. Degradation of aclonifen in soil under anaerobic conditions was investigated in one of the studies presented in the dossier but it was not considered reliable. A data gap, which was considered not essential to finalize the risk assessment of the EU representative uses, was identified by the meeting of experts.        Aclonifen may be considered moderate to high persistent in soil under aerobic conditions at 20 C (DT50 = 32.2 134 d).        Kinetics of all aerobic degradation data was re-evaluated with non linear regression to first order kinetic and values obtained were normalized to 20 degrees C and pF2. Since the report was not available in the updated dossier, the meeting identified a formal data gap for the applicant to incorporate this report (Hardy, I. and Patel, M. 2008) into it. The meeting of experts agreed the end points proposed by the RMS in table 66 of addendum 1.        Two field dissipation studies are available in Northern Europe (1 study in Germany, 4 sites) and Southern Europe (1 study in Spain and France, 1 site each). First order half lives between 57 d 195 d were observed in these trials. The two soil accumulation trials performed in Germany were considered not adequate to address the potential accumulation of aclonifen in soil. Accumulated, PEC soil were calculated by the RMS and presented in addendum 1 based on the worst case field half life, annual application of 2400 g/ha and no interception. Plateau steady state was calculated after 10 yr over a mixing layer of 20 cm. Actual and TWA PECs were calculated adding the result of the annual application on a 5 cm mixing layer over the plateau. The calculation was agreed by the experts in the meeting.        Aclonifen may be considered practically immobile in soil (K-proportional to = 5318 10612). Aclonifen is stable to hydrolysis at pH 5, 7 and 9. The aqueous photolysis study and the subsequent RMS model calculation show that photolysis may contribute in a limited extend to the degradation of aclonifen in the aquatic environment. Aclonifen is not readily biodegradable.        Degradation of aclonifen was investigated in one study with two water sediment systems (pH(water) = 6.7 7.5; pH(sed) = 6.8 8.4, OC 3.8 5.7 %, clay 10.54 28.99 %) incubated under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. In both water / sediment systems aclonifen steadily partitioned to the sediment and degraded. None of the metabolites observed reached 5 % AR in any of the phases. Mineralization was negligible in both systems (max CO2 = 2.07 % AR) and unextractable residue in the sediment amounted up to 65.6-76.5 % AR at the end of the experiments (180 d). Separated half lives for the water and sediment phases were considered unreliable and not representing true degradation by the experts. The meeting agreed that total system half lives could be used for the risk assessment (DT5o = 17.3 d). New FOCUS PECsw/SED up to STEP 4 (including effect of spray drift and run off mitigation by buffer and vegetative strips) using the agreed input parameters were available in addendum 1. The calculations were agreed for the STEP 3 and the STEP 4 when only spray drift mitigation was assumed. Therefore, only PECsw/SED presented in Table 17 of addendum 1 may be considered peer reviewed for the EU risk assessment.        Aclonifen is not considered to pose a risk for contamination of ground water above the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L when used according the GAPs for the representative use evaluated. Concentrations in air and transport through air are considered negligible for aclonifen.        The acute and short-term first-tier TERs for insectivorous birds and the acute TER for insectivorous mammals exceeded the trigger of 10 but the long-term risk needed further refinement. The refinement of PT was rejected in the experts' meeting since it was not sufficiently supported with data. A data gap was identified to submit a new refined long-term risk assessment for birds and mammals. The long-term endpoint (35 mg a.s./kg bw/d) used in the original risk assessment for mammals in the DAR was discussed in the meeting. Statistically significant effects on body weight were observed at the dose of 35 mg a.s./kg bw/d. The effects were <10% but a reduced fitness and thus adverse effects on populations of wild mammals under realistic environmental conditions cannot be excluded. The experts agreed that the NOEC of 8 mg a.s./kg bw/d should be used in the risk assessment. The risk of secondary poisoning of earthworm- and fish-eating birds and fish-eating mammals was assessed as low. The risk to earthworm-eating mammals needs further refinement. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water was considered to be low since the product is applied to bare soil. The lowest endpoints were observed in studies with fish, algae and higher aquatic plants. The experts accepted the use of 4-day time weighted average PECsw values to refine the risk to higher aquatic plants. The use of time weighted average values was also accepted for growth effects on fish but concerns were raised with regard to the long time interval of 28 days. It was suggested that the time window may be revised at MS level when guidance will be available from the e-link workshop. Effects on hatch success of fish were also observed in the early life stage test. Effects on hatch success can be caused by short exposure peaks. The experts agreed that the NOEC hatch success should be compared to initial PECsw values which lead to TERs significantly below the trigger of 10. However the TERs for algae are lower and the risk to fish would be covered by the risk mitigation required for algae. Even if a no-spray buffer zone of 40 m in combination with run-off mitigation by 80/95% is applied then the TERs are above the trigger in only one full FOCUS step 4 scenario (D5) and in the part scenario R1 (pond). It is noted that the suggested reduction of spray-drift entry exceeds the recommendation of the FOCUS Landscape report and uncertainty remains also with regard to the PECsw following the proposed run-off mitigation. The full scenarios R3, R4 and the part scenario R1(stream) still result in TERs below the trigger of 10. Overall it is concluded that the representative use of aclonifen poses a high risk to aquatic organisms. Brassica napus was the most sensitive non-target plant species tested. It reacted very sensitive under high temperature and high soil moisture growth conditions. Even an in-field no-spray buffer zone of 50 m would not be sufficient to achieve a TER of >5 for the ER50 of 1.12 g a.s./ha for Brassica napus. Under field exposure conditions the observed endpoints were significantly higher. However the experts identified uncertainties with regard to the influence of the weather conditions on the dissipation of aclonifen, the application pattern and actual exposure in the field studies. A data gap was identified in the experts' meeting for the applicant to provide a refined risk assessment for non target plants.        The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro- and microorganisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative use of aclonifen.

This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        The Netherlands being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on dodemorph in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 9 February 2007. The peer review was initiated on 4 May 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a fungicide on roses under permanent protection. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Mehltaumittel"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). In the formulation the active substance is present as the acetate variant.        Methods of analysis for products of plant and animal origin are not required for the representative use on roses. Adequate methods are available to monitor the sum of cis and trans dodemorph in soil and air. Methods of analysis for water have been identified as a data gap.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some of the quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Several data gaps have been identified. Namely new 5 batch data, water solubility, vapour pressure, Henry's law constant and surface tension.        Mammalian toxicology was assessed in a series of tests. Dodemorph is absorbed rapidly to an extent of at least 40%. It is distributed widely and uniformly. It has no potential for accumulation. It is excreted rapidly and practically completely and is extensively metabolised. It is of low acute toxicity by the oral and dermal route. Based on its irritant, corrosive and sensitising properties a classification as Xi; R37 ""Irritant to the respiratory system"", C; R34 ""Corrosive; Causes burns"" (Xi; R41 ""Irritant; Risk of serious damage to eyes"" is implicit) and Xi; R43 ""Irritant; May cause skin sensitisation"" was proposed. Short term studies were carried out with rats, dogs and rabbits. The liver was the main target of toxicity. The lowest NOAEL of 8.2 mg/kg bw/d was based on vomiting, salivation, changes in faecal excretion and liver effects seen in dogs. Dodemorph is not genotoxic. A 2-year rat and an 18-month mouse study have been reported. Critical effects observed were decreased bodyweight gain (both species) and liver effects (rat) while no increased tumour incidences could be observed in these investigations. Dodemorph did not cause effects on reproduction but induced developmental effects in rabbits (open eye, irregularly shapen sternebrae) based on which a classification as Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R63 ""Harmful; Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) was set at 0.082 mg/kg bw/d, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) and the acute reference dose (ARfD) were set at 0.033 mg/kg bw/d and at 0.33 mg/kg bw respectively. Operator exposure amounts to 88% of the AOEL when personal protective equipment (PPE) in the form of gloves, coverall and gas mask is worn. Worker exposure when PPE (gloves, coverall and gas mask) is used amounts to 45% of the systemic AOEL of 0.033 mg/kg bw/d. Bystander exposure is not anticipated based on the use of dodemorph in greenhouses.        No data were submitted to study and assess the residue behaviour of dodemorph in plants and livestock animals in order to define the relevant residues for dietary consumer risk assessment. The representative use of dodemorph on roses is normally not expected to result in any dietary exposure to humans or livestock animals. A situation where treated rose petals are used for human consumption was neither assessed nor considered. Under conditions excluding any potential consumer exposure to dodemorph residues, there will be no dietary consumer risk related to the notified representative use.        In soil under aerobic conditions dodemorph acetate exhibits moderate to high persistence forming no major metabolite (> 10% applied radioactivity (AR)), but forming an unknown minor non-transient metabolite. Mineralisation to carbon dioxide accounted for 17.1-35.9% AR after 93-125 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink accounting for 21.9% to 43.4% of the applied radioactivity after 93-125 days. Dodemorph is immobile in soil and there was no indication that adsorption was pH dependant.        In dark natural sediment water systems dodemorph degraded exhibiting fast disappearance from the water column, but high persistence in sediment. No major metabolites were found. The terminal metabolite, carbon dioxide, accounted for 15.4-23.2% AR by 103 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a significant sink representing 27-28% AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were carried out assuming 0.1% emission from glasshouse (Dutch approach). These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by dodemorph above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However no calculation for the unknown minor non-transient metabolite was available.        Although it is expected that dodemorph does not reach the surrounding environment in significant amounts, emission to surface water is considered possible. A risk assessment for birds and mammals was provided for exposure from contaminated drinking water and for consumption of contaminated fish. A PECsw value was based on the Dutch model. A long-term reproductive endpoint for birds was estimated by using the lower endpoint from reproductive effect studies on birds for related substances (Structure Activity Relationship). The risk assessment indicated a low risk to birds and mammals exposed to dodemorph through drinking water and fish. In the aquatic environment dodemorph was most toxic to fish and daphnia. It was considered to be toxic to aquatic organisms on an acute scale and very toxic on a chronic scale. Dodemorph is lipophilic (logPow = 4.6) and the bioaccumulation factor was estimated in the range of 583-746 based on whole fish. Given a TER >> 10 based on the fish early life stage endpoint the risk from bioaccumulation was considered to be low. Whereas the risk to bees was considered to be low, assessment of non-target arthropods (NTA) indicated a risk. This is of particular importance as various non-target arthropods may be used in integrated pest management in greenhouses. The risk to earthworms was considered to be low as was the risk to non target soil micro-organisms and micro-organisms in sewage treatment plant. No data were submitted nor required for non-target macro soil organisms. Risk to non-target plants was considered to be negligible for glass house use and no data were submitted by the applicant.

This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on copper (I), copper (II) variants in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 7 June 2007. The peer review was initiated on 17 September 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant the European Union Copper Task Force. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide/bactericide on grapes and tomatoes. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints.        The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Kocide 101"" (copper hydroxide), a wettable powder formulation containing 500 g/kg of Cu; ""Mace 80"" (Bordeaux mixture), a wettable powder formulation containing 200 g/kg of Cu; ""Cuprocaffaro WP"" (copper oxychloride), a wettable powder formulation containing 500 g/kg of Cu; ""Cuproxat SC"" (tribasic copper sulfate), a suspension concentrate formulation containing 193 g/L of Cu and ""Nordox 75 WG "" (copper (I) oxide), a wettable granule formulation containing 750 g/kg Cu.        Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The methods of analysis for the technical materials and the formulations are not accepted at this time as the identity of the various variants of copper are in question. The specifications and batch data are not accepted. In addition to this, there are some missing physical and chemical properties as well as storage stability data for the variants of copper.        In the mammalian metabolism studies, bioequivalence was established for the five representative copper (I) and (II) variants with copper sulphate pentahydrate, with which most of the toxicological studies were conducted. As a micronutrient essential for life, copper follows a specific homeostatic regulation mechanism, which allows excess copper to be excreted mainly through the bile; once absorbed, copper is bound to proteins so that free copper is normally not found neither in the blood, nor in the cells.        Copper hydroxide is toxic by inhalation, harmful if swallowed and present a risk of serious damage to eyes. Bordeaux mixture is harmful by inhalation and presents a risk of serious damage to eyes. Copper oxychloride and copper (I) oxide are harmful by inhalation and if swallowed. Tribasic copper sulphate is harmful if swallowed. Target organs of excess copper after oral administration are the liver and the kidneys. A concern was raised over inhalation of copper as lung lesions found in operator exposure were reproducible in guinea pigs; a data gap was identified for a short term inhalation toxicity study. Genotoxicity was not of concern upon oral administration, however, there was insufficient evidence to exclude a genotoxic potential of copper after non-oral exposure, and a critical area of concern was raised after inhalation of copper (I) and (II) variants. No carcinogenic potential was attributed to copper, neither in rats nor in humans. Copper did not produce adverse effect on fertility, reproductive parameters or on the development; no neurotoxicity was attributed to copper ingestion, either. Four categories of copper poisoning were identified in the literature, namely direct oral ingestion as suicide attempts, cases where food or drinking water had become contaminated with copper, cases where home-made Bordeaux mixture had resulted in lung disease, and a single case of long term administration of excess copper as a dietary supplement resulting in liver failure.        Based on the WHO values established for human copper intake, the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) or more appropriately designated as ""upper limit for copper intake"" - for copper (I) and (II) variants was 0.15 mg Cu/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.072 mg Cu/kg bw/day and no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Default value of 10 % for dermal absorption was set for the five concentrate representative formulations and the in-use spray dilutions. Operator exposure calculated for field applications was below the AOEL only, if personal protective equipment (PPE) was used; for greenhouse applications, estimated operator exposure was below the AOEL only, if a respiratory protective equipment (RPE) was added to the PPE. Unprotected bystander exposure was calculated to be below the AOEL for all proposed uses and all representative formulations. Estimates of worker exposure indicated that exposure to copper (I) and (II) variants may exceed the AOEL for workers wearing protective gloves, long sleeved shirt and long trousers in some scenarios of application. Therefore, a refinement of worker risk assessment is required for those specific scenarios.        Data presented and evaluated on the uptake, translocation and nature of copper residues in plants consist mainly of a review of public scientific literature. To determine the magnitude of residues in the treated raw agricultural commodities, residue trials in grapes and tomatoes were submitted. Also data on the residue levels in processed tomato and grape products were made available, but only found valid and acceptable for grapes. The data allow for MRL proposals and for a consumer exposure assessment with regard to the notified representative uses. As exposure to copper is not only due to residues from the use as a plant protection product, an aggregate exposure assessment was performed by the rapporteur Member State, including in addition background levels of copper in food and drinking water, based on a recent French dietary survey. This aggregate estimate shows that, in particular for children, the overall dietary copper exposure is not negligible and approximates the established toxicological reference value. Additional potential sources of dietary copper intakes have not been considered. Moreover, the estimate is not representative for all European consumers and therefore situations may arise where the overall copper intake of some consumer groups exceeds the toxicological reference value.        The data presented in the dossier and summarized in the DAR on the fate and behaviour of copper in soil consist mainly of a review of public scientific literature. Although the information is qualitatively complete, it does not allow deriving quantitative parameters to perform a proper environmental risk assessment. Data gaps have been identified by the rapporteur Member State for accumulated PEC soil, PECSW/SED and PECGW values as well as for the experimental (laboratory, field or monitoring) data to asses them. The data gaps have been confirmed by the peer review.        The representative uses of the various copper variants are applications to vines and tomatoes (outdoor and indoor). The risk to herbivorous birds from the use in tomatoes was considered low since the tomato foliage is not palatable to birds.        The first-tier acute, short-term and long-term TERs for insectivorous birds were below the Annex VI trigger values for all representative uses. The refined risk assessment suggests a low acute and short-term risk to birds, but further refinement is needed for the long-term risk assessment. The first-tier long-term TERs for earthworm-eating birds and mammals were below the Annex VI trigger of 5. No further information was provided to refine the risk assessment and a data gap was identified in the meeting of experts. The first-tier risk assessment for mammals indicated a potential high acute and long-term risk. The refined risk assessment submitted by the applicant was not transparent. It was not clear which refinements were taken into account and no information/data were provided to support the refined acute and long-term risk assessment. Therefore, a data gap was identified for a refined risk assessment for mammals where all refinement steps are transparent and supported by information/data. The risk to birds and mammals from the use in tomatoes in glasshouse is considered to be low because of negligible exposure.        Copper is very toxic to the aquatic organisms. An indoor-microcosm study was submitted to address the risk to aquatic invertebrates. The experts suggested using a NOEC of 3.12 lag Cu (dissolved)/L together with a safety factor of 3-5 to take into account uncertainties related to effects on chironomids and possible favourable exposure conditions in the microcosm (high pH). Information from public literature suggests a high potential of bioaccumulation of copper in some aquatic organisms. The potential risk of bioaccumulation in fish needs to be addressed further. A data gap was identified in the meeting to address the risk from bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms.        The risk assessment for aquatic organisms needs to be finalized once reliable PECsw/sed values are established for the outdoor uses of copper in tomato and vines. The risk to aquatic organisms from the use in tomato in glasshouse is considered to be low.        The risk to bees from contact exposure was assessed as low, except for copper oxychloride and the Bordeaux mixture. The risk to bees from oral exposure was assessed as high in the first-tier risk assessment, and the experts suggested a data gap to address the risk to bees further.        A high long-term risk to earthworms was indicated on the basis of the available information. A data gap was identified to address the long-term risk to earthworms.        Information from published studies with soil macro-organisms was submitted by the applicant. The studies were considered as reliable and robust enough to be considered in the risk assessment. No effects of >25% on soil nitrification were observed up to the highest tested application rate of 20 kg Cu/ha. A reduction of 29 % in carbon mineralization was observed on day 28, at an application rate of 12.5 kg Cu/ha in a study with copper hydroxide. However, a final conclusion on the risk to soil macro- and micro-organisms can only be drawn after reliable PECsoil values have been established.        The assessment of the risk to non-target plants is based on information from public literature. It was not possible for the experts to draw a conclusion on the reliability of the studies. The experts agreed that a more comprehensive summary of the literature information is needed. Furthermore, the accumulation of copper in the off-field area should be considered in the risk assessment.        The risk to non-target arthropods and to biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated.

The insecticide caused a reduction in the number of erythrocytes and hemoglobin content after 96 h exposure, probably due to hemolysis. Hyperglycemic response indicated energy mobilization, and may have contributed to the increase in osmolarity after 96 h exposure to DFB. The induction of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase activities in liver pointed to the activation of xenobiotic metabolic pathways and antioxidant defenses. The decrease in muscle AChE at all experimental times showed that DFB is an AChE inhibitor. In addition, DFB induced hepatic alterations that might impair normal liver functions. These results show that DFB can cause health disorders in fish and further studies are required to better define its safe use in aquaculture. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

rayyan-1227191430,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fluazinam,2008,7,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,7,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Fluazinam is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Austria being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fluazinam in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 3 January 2006. The peer review was initiated on 23 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant ISK Biosciences Europe. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in May 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in July and October 2007.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises foliar spraying to potatoes against late blight and tuber blight (Phytophtora infestans). Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Fluazinam 5005C"", a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 500 g/L fluazinam.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring for food/feed of plant origin, for environmental matrices and for body fluids and tissues.        Concerning the mammalian toxicology, the toxicokinetic studies have shown that oral absorption of fluazinam was 35% of the administered dose. In the acute studies, fluazinam was harmful by inhalation (Xn, R20), severely irritating to the eyes (Xi, R41) and skin sensitizer (R43).        The liver was the target organ in repeat dose studies with rats, mice and dogs. Some haematological changes were also observed in dogs, and the increased vacuolation of white matter in brain and spinal cord observed at high doses was demonstrated to be directly related to one impurity. Therefore it was agreed that the level of this impurity in the technical specification should not exceed the amount present in the toxicological batches, i.e. 0.2%. Based on the effects observed in the skin in the repeat dose study by dermal administration, the classification Xi, R38 Irritating to the skin was proposed for fluazinam. In the genotoxicity studies, no mutagenic potential was observed in vitro or in vivo. There was no carcinogenic potential in long term studies. In the reproduction studies, the fertility parameters and the offspring were not affected, but the indications of teratogenicity in the rat studies led to the proposal of classification Reprotox. Cat. 3, R63 Possible risk of harm to the unborn child. No adverse effect on the nervous system was observed in specific neurotoxicity studies with rats.        The relative toxicity of the plant metabolite trifuoro-acetic acid (TFAA) in comparison with fluazinam could not be established based on the available data.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day, the acute reference dose (ARfD) 0.07 mg/kg bw and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) 0.004 mg/kg bw/day, all derived with the use of a safety factor 100. The dermal absorption values were 1.5% for the concentrate and 7% for the dilution. The operator exposure estimate is below the AOEL according to the German model when personal protective equipment is used, and the worker exposure estimates (during crop inspection or harvesting) are below the AOEL with the use of personal protective equipment.        Based on appropriate metabolism studies, the metabolism of fluazinam in potatoes is clearly elucidated. Parent compound, AMPA-FLUAZINAM and AMGT are present at harvest in potato tubers at low but comparable amounts and are included in the residue definition for risk assessment. A further degradation product was identified as TFAA. This metabolite is present at very low levels in potato tubers but also in rotational crops. As information on its toxicological properties is lacking, the proposed residue definition is provisional.        For enforcement, the residue definition can be restricted to parent compound. Supervised residue trials show that the MRL for potatoes can be set at the LOQ (limit of quantification level).        Livestock exposure to fluazinam residues is very low and the setting of a residue definition and MRLs in animal products is not necessary.        Under restriction of the information to be provided on the toxicological relevance of TFAA and if appropriate on the actual consumer exposure to this metabolite, no dietary risk is expected resulting from the representative use of fluazinam in potatoes.        It must be noted that the issue related to TFAA is a generic issue and potentially concerns a range of active substances containing a trifluoromethyl moiety.        Under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C, fluazinam is medium to high persistent in soil. Substitution of phenyl ring chlorine by hydroxyl in fluazinam yields the major soil metabolite HYPA that was shown to be moderate to high persistent under these conditions. Other minor metabolites identified resulted from the reduction of the phenyl nitro groups to form the corresponding anilines. In the experiment performed in the most recent study (1 soil) up to 14 minor metabolites were found and none of them individually exceeded 4.7 % AR. Metabolites resulting from the cleavage of the bridging amino group have not been identified in any of the available studies. After 90 d non extractable residues reached levels of 16.7 50.5 % AR and mineralization was almost negligible.        Fluazinam was low to moderate persistent under dark anaerobic conditions due to the relatively rapid reduction of the nitro groups to form the MAPA, AMPA-FLUAZINAM and DAPA metabolites.        Higher amounts of non extractable residues were formed under these conditions.        Photolysis was shown to contribute to the degradation of fluazinam in soil. HYPA and AMPA-FLUAZINAM are found as minor photolysis metabolites.        There are field dissipation studies available in UK (two sites), Germany (four sites) and USA (four sites). USA field trials were considered not relevant for EU conditions and were not used in the risk assessment. The potential effect of photolysis on the degradation of fluazinam in these field trials was discussed in the experts' meeting. The meeting agreed that the kinetic parameters derived from the field trials were not appropriate for use in environmental modelling and that new FOCUS PECsw and FOCUS PECGw will need to be calculated on basis of laboratory data. Furthermore, since the studies were performed on bare soil they were not considered representative of the uses proposed. Therefore new PEC soil calculation using the longest laboratory half life and application every two years for potato was regarded as necessary by the meeting. After the experts meeting, new PEC soil have been presented by the rapporteur Member State in an updated addendum to B.8 following the parameters agreed by the meeting.        According batch soil adsorption / desorption studies available fluazinam may be considered slight to low mobile and HYPA low to medium mobile. Fluazinam may be considered stable at pH 4 and it is rapidly hydrolysed at pH 7 and pH 9. The major hydrolysis metabolite at pH 7 and 9 was CAPA that is stable to hydrolysis under normal environmental conditions.        Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the environmental dissipation of fluazinam Fluazinam is not readily biodegradable according the available study.        In water sediment systems fluazinam partitioned with the sediment and was converted to a number of metabolites through substitution of chlorine atom and reduction of nitro groups. Among these metabolites only AMPA-FLUAZINAM reached levels above 10 % in the sediment phase. Non extractable residues amounted up to 55 % AR after 100 d and mineralization was practically negligible. There are no indications that the amino bridge between the two rings is broken during the degradation. Dissipation rate of metabolite AMPA-FLUAZINAM was calculated with data of one of the systems. The rapporteur Member State provided in an addendum the whole system kinetic parameters for HYPA based on a multicompartmental fitting of the data of both systems. The rapporteur Member State identified shortcomings in the water/sediment study that do not invalidate it in its integrity but need to be considered when using the results for risk assessment.        PECsw for fluazinam and for the major sediment metabolite AMPA-FLUAZINAM were presented in the DAR for the representative use in potatoes. The input parameters used in the applicant's calculation for fluazinam were not agreed by the meeting. After the meeting, the rapporteur Member State presented new FOCUS PECsw and PECSED for Fluazinam and HYPA using the input parameters agreed by the meeting of experts in the updated addendum to B.8.        Potential ground water contamination by fluazinam and the major soil metabolite HYPA for the representative use in potatoes may be considered negligible with the available modelling.        Fluazinam may be relatively persistent in air but a high degree of uncertainty is associated to the estimation of its atmospheric half life. However, it is not volatile enough to perform an experimental measurement of its atmospheric photochemical stability.        The risk assessment followed the Guidance Document on Risk Assessment for Birds and Mammals (SANCO/4145/2000). It is not considered necessary to calculate the risk to herbivorous birds and mammals in potatoes as potato leaves are considered unpalatable. Therefore the risk to herbivorous birds and mammals is considered to be low. Based on the first tier risk assessment the risk to insectivorous birds and mammals can be regarded as low for the representative use of fluazinam evaluated. As the Log Pow of fluazinam exceeds 3, the risk to birds and mammals from secondary poisoning was assessed. The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals can be considered as low. Also the risk to earthworm eating birds can be considered as low, whereas as further refinement is still required to identify low risk for earthworm eating mammals No risk is expected for birds or mammals from the ingestion of contaminated drinking water.        Fish was the most sensitive aquatic organisms on an acute and chronic time scale in the standard dataset. All scenarios were acceptable at FOCUSsw step 4, including a buffer zone of 10 m. The risk to aquatic invertebrates and algae is considered low at FOCUS Step 3 and Step 2 respectively. The risk to HYPA and G-504 is inconclusive due to lack of toxicity data. The risk to sediment dwelling organisms is concluded to be low, but risk assessment based on sediment concentrations is missing. The risk for bees and NTA is considered low from the representative use of fluazinam. As for the earthworms the acute risk assessment indicated indicating a low acute risk to earthworms. Whereas the reproductive study on earthworms did not meet the Annex VI trigger, a field study with earthworms addressed the long term risk to earthworms. Given the DT90field in soil for fluazinam and the observed effects on earthworms and A. rhopalosiphi, a study on the effects on collembolan was submitted. The toxicity to collembolan triggered a litterbag study. At litterbag study was submitted bud not accepted as the exposure was to low. A data gap was identified for a new litterbag study, in which the new PECplateau is covered. In this study the presence of and effects on macro organisms should be checked.        The risk to soil non-target micro-organisms and non-target plants is considerer to be low for both fluazinam and HYPA.

rayyan-1227191431,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance benfluralin,2008,7,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,7,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Benfluralin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review program covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on benfluralin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 16 February 2006. The peer review was initiated on 1 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroScience. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in May - June 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2007.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on lettuce and chicory (salad and root production) full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Bonalan"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC).        Adequate methods are available to monitor benfluralin in plants, soil water and air. However for water and plants the residue definition has not been concluded on and further data may be required. For products of animal origin it is currently not clear if a residue definition is required and therefore further methods may be required in the future. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are still some outstanding issues related to a relevant impurity, R65 classification, emulsion stability, efficiency of the tank cleaning procedure and testing at different pH for various parameters.        In mammalian metabolism studies, benfluralin showed a rapid but incomplete oral absorption, rapid excretion, mainly via faeces, and no potential for accumulation.        Benfluralin has a low acute toxicity, but showed irritating and sensitizing properties, which require classification with R36/38 irritating to eyes and skin and R43 may cause sensitisation by skin contact. Main target organs in short term and long term studies were the liver and kidneys. Classification with R40 limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect is proposed, based on neoplastic changes observed in the liver of rats and mice and thyroid tumours in rats upon long term exposure. Benfluralin showed no potential for genotoxicity or neurotoxicity. No effects on fertility or on reproductive parameters were observed as well as any adverse effects on development or teratogenicity.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is set at 0.005 mg/kg bw/day considering an assessment factor of 100; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.05 mg/kg bw/day set using an assessment factor of 100 with a correction of 30 % for oral absorption (overall assessment factor of 333); no acute reference dose (ARfD) is allocated. The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL if personal protective equipment (PPE) as gloves is used, at least during the mixing and loading operations. No risk is anticipated for workers or bystanders derived from benfluralin applications.        The plant metabolism of benfluralin was investigated in lettuce (category leafy crops), alfalfa and peanuts (pulses/ oilseed crop category). The Meeting of experts considered that the detailed information on the undertaken preliminary work on the metabolites characterisation/ identification should be submitted in order to conclude on the validity of these studies. No metabolism study was submitted to support a use in root and tuber crops. The experts in residues have concluded that further data is necessary to finalise the residue definition for primary and rotational crops, the livestock exposure assessment and eventually the consumer risk assessment. At the current stage, a residue definition and MRLs can only provisionally be proposed, but need to be reconsidered upon receipt of the necessary data. Based on the presumption that the only relevant residues for consumer exposure is parent benfluralin in primary crops, the estimated chronic intake would be less than 1% of the ADI of benfluralin for the considered consumer groups. The consumer risk assessment will have to be revised when the outstanding data and information was evaluated.        Available data demonstrate that under aerobic conditions the degradation of benfluralin in soil did not lead to any major (> 10% of the applied radioactivity (AR)) metabolite, although the minor non transient metabolite B12 was formed in amounts > 5% AR at two consecutive sampling points. Benfluralin is moderate to medium persistent in soil under aerobic conditions with half-lives ranging from 20 to 86 days. No reliable DT50 values for metabolite B12 are available. Field dissipation studies were conducted in northern Europe only and resulted in moderate half-lives of 34 to 73 days for benfluralin.        Two major metabolites B36 (max. 23.2% AR at day 1) and U6#1 (max. 25.0% AR at day 2) were formed under anaerobic conditions. The peer review concluded that, if applied for intended uses, no further assessment was necessary for these metabolites.        Soil photolysis is not expected to be a significant route of degradation in the environment.        Data indicate that benfluralin is strongly adsorbed to soil and could be classified as immobile. No reliable data on adsorption properties of metabolite B12 are available.        Benfluralin is hydrolytically stable under environmental conditions. Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of benfluralin producing the major metabolites des-alkyl benfluralin diamine (max 11.5% AR), propyl benzimidazole (max. 16.4% AR), methyl benzimidazole (max 11.5% AR), ethyl propyl benzimidazole (max 19.5% AR). Because of the rapid photodegradation of benfluralin in water, a data gap was identified by the fate experts to address the potential surface water contamination of the photolysis metabolites.        Parent benfluralin is not expected to contaminate ground water at levels above 0.1 mu g/L under the proposed conditions of use. The meeting of Member State experts identified a data gap with respect to metabolite B12 for the necessary information (including experimentally derived Koc values and degradation rates) to produce revised FOCUS groundwater assessment.        The water/sediment study, the aerobic soil metabolism study and Henry's Law constant indicated the high volatility of benfluralin. However, the calculated photochemical oxidative degradation half-life of benfluralin in air is rapid (<6 hrs) and therefore significant amounts of benfluralin are not expected to be present in air.        Benfluralin is applied pre-sowing or pre-planting by broadcast spray followed by incorporation in soil to control weeds. Hence no leafy crops or weeds are present in the field after the application. Benfluralin is not systemic and the uptake of plants is limited. A potential high risk was identified for earthworm eating-birds and mammals. The suggested refinements were not accepted in the expert meeting and a data gap was identified for a new refined long-term risk assessment for earthworm eating birds and mammals. The risk to algae and higher aquatic plants was assessed as low. A 20m non-spray buffer zone was included in the PECsw values used in the aquatic risk assessment for the water bodies stream and ditch. The TERs for fish were above the trigger of 100 in all drainage scenarios (D3, D4, D6) and in the run-off scenarios R1 and R4 but were below the trigger in the runoff scenarios R2 and R3. No full FOCUS scenario resulted in TERs above the trigger of 100 for aquatic invertebrates. Only the TERs for the part scenarios D4 (pond) and R1 (pond) exceeded the trigger of 100. The chronic TER values for fish and daphnia were calculated with 50 d twa-PECsw instead of initial PECsw. The experts agreed that time weighted average PECsw values can be used in the TER calculations for endpoints based on growth effects (fish early life stage study) but the rapid dissipation from the water phase has to be considered and the time period should not be longer than 5 times the DT50 (in this case 7days). The chronic endpoint for daphnids is based on reproduction and therefore should be compared to initial PECsw concentrations. A data gap was identified in the expert meeting for the applicant to provide a new chronic aquatic risk assessment taking into account the suggestions of the expert meeting and to refine further the acute risk to invertebrates. No final conclusion can be drawn on the risk to aquatic organisms from the photolysis metabolites at this stage and should be addressed in the new aquatic risk assessment in line with the data gap identified in the section on fate and behaviour. The risk assessment for soil non-target arthropods resulted in a TER of 4.8 based on an initial PEC soil of 1.14 mg benfluralin/kg from the worst case application in lettuce. Since the TER value is close to the trigger of 5 and based on initial PECs it was agreed in the expert meeting that the risk to soil non-target arthropods is sufficiently addressed for most environmental conditions but Member States could ask for further risk refinement if benfluralin is expected to degrade slowly under their local environmental conditions.        The risk to bees, earthworms, non-target arthropods, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

It was concluded during the peer review process that the name buprofezin can not be used for this active substance.        Adequate methods are available to monitor NNI-750 in all matrices.        Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-methodslike the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 are not applicable due to the nature of the residues.        Sufficient analytical methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        However, the suspensibility and wettability results were poor and a sprayability study was requested.        In mammals, NNI-750 acute oral, dermal or inhalation toxicity is low (oral and dermal LD50 >2000 mg/kg bw, LC50 4.57 mg/L air /4h). NNI-750 is not a skin or eye irritant nor a skin sensitiser.        Target organs in subchronic and chronic studies are liver and thyroid, showing increased weights and histological and clinical chemistry findings. The relevant short term NOAEL in rats is 13 mg/kg bw/day while in dogs, the relevant NOAEL is 10 mg/kg bw/day. The relevant long term toxicity NOAEL in rats is 0.90 mg/kg bw/day while in mice, it is 1.82 mg/kg bw/day.        Genotoxicity of NNI-750 was discussed in an opinion of the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) based on a new micronucleus test in the bone marrow of mouse showing the induction of micronuclei in the erythrocytes of mouse bone marrow when administered by oral gavage once daily for two consecutive days. The Panel considered NNI-750 non genotoxic and the recent in vivo micronucleus test on bone marrow as not interpretable. The PPR Panel re-evaluated also the long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity studies on NNI-750 and concluded that NNI-750 is not carcinogenic in rats or mice.        NNI-750 did not show any reproductive toxicity potential: the relevant parental and offspring NOAELs are 6.46 mg/kg bw/day f and 9.21 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The reproductive NOAEL is 66 mg/kg bw/day. As for teratogenicity studies, overall, the NOAEL for both maternal and foetal effects is 50 mg/kg (based on decreased food consumption and increased water intake, skeletal effects and subcutaneous oedema, respectively),It was agreed not to propose any classification.        NNI-750 does not have potential to induce neurotoxicity in mammals.        The Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day is based on the relevant NOAEL of 0.9 mg/kg bw/day from the 24 month study in rats, with an SF of 100. The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level is 0.04 mg/kg bw/day, based on a NOAEL of 10 mg/kg bw/day, with an SF of 100 and a correction for oral absorption of 40%. The Acute Reference Dose is 0.5 mg/kg bw based on the NOAEL from the developmental toxicity study and applying an SF 100.        The operator exposure was below the AOEL-value for tractor mounted spraying with personal protective equipment for tomato and citrus calculated with the German model. For hand-held application exposure was under the AOEL with PPE for tomato outdoors (UK-POEM) and in glasshouse, as for lettuce (Dutch model), and for citrus (German model). The bystanders showed estimated exposure levels below the AOEL (<15%) for both applications on tomato and citrus. Worker exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL with gloves when handling tomato or lettuce in glasshouse or tomato outdoors. Instead, exposure was above the AOEL even with gloves when handling citrus.        The metabolism of NNI-750 in plants has been elucidated. The parent compound is the major constituent of the final residue. Minor plant metabolites were identified. Their structures differ significantly from that of NNI-750 and their toxicological properties have not been sufficiently investigated. Also under processing conditions degradation products are formed with unknown toxicological potential. Therefore, although a residue definition can be proposed for monitoring (NNI-750), the residue definition for risk assessment has not been set. For this reason a consumer risk assessment is currently not possible.        A potential transfer of residues to rotational crops has been noted.        No residues are expected in animal commodities.        In soil under aerobic conditions NNI-750 exhibits medium to high persistence. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring to carbon dioxide accounted for 19-51% applied radioactivity (AR) after 90-98 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 23-33 % AR after 90-98 days. Only minor (<5%AR) metabolites were formed. NNI-750 exhibits slight mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of NNI-750 was pH dependant.        In dark natural sediment water systems NNI-750 degraded exhibiting moderate persistence in both water and sediment forming the metabolite NNI-750 sulfoxide (BF-10)2 in water (max. 12%AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 18 % AR at 91 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink representing 14-15 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for NNI-750 at steps 1-3 and for citrus steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolite NNI-750 sulfoxide (BF -10) appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by NNI-750 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low for the outdoor uses assessed in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. An assessment of the potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended protected (glasshouse) uses with higher rates and numbers of applications than in outdoor uses is not available, though the potential for groundwater exposure from these uses is also likely to be low.        The acute toxicity of NNI-750 is low to birds and mammals Following the principles of SANCO/ 4145/2000 the acute and long-term risk to birds and mammals were assessed to below. For the small herbivorous mammal in citrus an interception of 70% was taken in to account to reach a TER-value above the Annex IV trigger. Low risk is foreseen for earthworm- and fish-eating birds and mammals, as the risk to birds and mammals ingesting contaminated drinking water is also considered too be low.        NNI-750 is as very toxic to aquatic organisms. TER values for use in tomatoes indicate low risk without any risk mitigation. Buffer zones of 20 m are required for use in citrus to identify low risk. Further data are needed to address the risk to sediment dwelling organisms from NNI-750. NNI-750 is not considered to bioaccumulate in fish.        Low risk was identified for all other non-target organism groups, except for a data gap on a reproduction test with Collembola, to address the risk of use in citrus.

rayyan-1227191434,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance napropamide,2008,7,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,7,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Napropamide is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on napropamide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 6 September 2005. The peer review was initiated on 17 February 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant United Phosphorus. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in April May 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2007.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a pre-planting herbicide on head cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, calabrese, tomatoes and oilseed rape. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Devrinol SC 450"", a suspension concentrate formulation (SC) registered under different trade names in Europe.        Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of napropamide. For surface water the supplied method does not have a LOQ that is low enough and therefore a new data gap has been identified. In addition to this it should be noted that the residue definition for water is not finalised and therefore further methods could be required in the future.        Due to various reasons the minimum purity of the active substance and the impurity specification can not be concluded on.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        In mammalian metabolism studies, napropamide was rapidly and extensively absorbed (> 90 %), and widely distributed. Extensive metabolism and enterohepatic circulation were observed, as biliary excretion was a major pathway, and then excretion was rapid trough urine and faeces. Fifteen metabolites were identified and only < 0.5 % of the dose was recovered as parent compound.        Napropamide has low acute toxicity and no classification is proposed related to acute toxicity testing including irritancy and sensitisation. Critical effect observed through short term and long term studies was decreased body weight. Two out of six in vitro gene mutation assays showed positive effects, as well as one weak positive effect for DNA damage and repair in mammalian cells out of five chromosomal tests, but three in vivo tests were all negative. So, overall, no genotoxic potential is attributed to napropamide. No potential for carcinogenicity or neurotoxicity was observed; no adverse effect on fertility or on reproductive parameters was observed either, except for a higher abortion rate at maternally toxic doses in the rabbit which could not be ruled out from being a substance related effect. No foetotoxicity or teratogenicity was evidenced. Relevant short term NOAEL was the dose level of 50 mg/kg bw/day from the 1-year oral toxicity study in dog and 90-day oral study in rat, and the overall relevant long term NOAEL was 30 mg/kg bw/day derived from both 2-year, rat studies.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is set at 0.3 mg/kg bw/day; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.5 mg/kg bw/day considering an assessment factor of 100 and no acute reference dose is allocated.        The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL if personal protective equipment (PPE) is used. No risk is anticipated for workers or bystanders derived from napropamide applications.        Napropamide is extensively metabolised in plants. More than 10 metabolites have been identified but their individual concentration levels are not expected to exceed 0.01 mg/kg. Considering the low consumer exposure and the toxicological profile of the compound, the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring is proposed to be restricted to the parent compound on a provisional basis. Further information is needed to conclude on the toxicological relevance of 3 metabolites which are not covered by the toxicological studies performed with the parent compound.        Supervised residue trials confirmed that MRLs can be set at the analytical limit of quantification (0.01 mg/kg) for all representative uses.        Investigation of the effect of processing on residues is not needed. Livestock exposure is minimal and a residue definition for animal commodities is not necessary. A potential transfer of soil residues of napropamide above 0.01 mg/kg is present for root crops for plant back intervals up to 180 days.        Provisionally, no risk for the consumer has been identified.        In soil under aerobic conditions napropamide exhibits moderate to very high persistence forming the minor non transient soil metabolite NOPA(2) (accounting for a maximum of 5.8% of applied radioactivity (AR) in 30 degrees C incubations and 1.1%AR in 20 degrees C incubations) which exhibits moderate persistence. Note the database is limited and further data are necessary to further clarify the persistence of both napropamide (southern European field studies) and NOPA. Mineralisation of 1-naphthyl radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted for only 5% AR after 90 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 13.2 % AR after 90 days. Napropamide exhibits medium to low mobility in soil, NOPA exhibits high mobility in soil. The adsorption behaviour of NOPA was pH dependant (lower adsorption as soil pH increased).        In dark natural sediment water systems napropamide partitioned relatively slowly from water to sediment where it degraded exhibiting high to very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 3.6 AR at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were the major sink representing 11-19 % AR at study end. In a laboratory aqueous photolysis study napropamide was photolysed to 4 major metabolites (all identified). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach are not available so the risk assessment to aquatic organisms is not finalised.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by napropamide above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low under the more northern European geoclimatic situations that are represented by the FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However further field DT50 reflecting southern European conditions are required before the groundwater exposure assessment for parent napropamide can be finalised. For the metabolite NOPA further soil DT50 and kinetic formation fraction data are required to finalise the groundwater exposure assessment. However based on the available simulations, that use too favourable input parameters, it is clear that a groundwater non relevance assessment is triggered and NOPA concentrations will be > 0.75 g/L. From the mammalian toxicological point of view NOPA is not relevant, but biological screening data against target plants and a consumer risk assessment would be required before a conclusion on groundwater non relevance of NOPA could be finalised.        The risk to birds was assessed as low for all representative uses evaluated. The first-tier long-term TER value of 4.6 was below the trigger of 5 for the use in tomato. It was agreed that the risk to insectivorous birds is likely to be low because the endpoint (NOEC reproduction) is based on the highest tested dose and that a certain proportion of the insect prey would consist of large insects (lower residues compared to small insects). The risk to birds from secondary poisoning for earthworm-eating birds was assessed as low. The TER values were in the range of 46-103 indicating some margin of safety. The risk assessment the Southern European use (tomato) can be finalised once updated PECsoil values are available.        The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals needs to be assessed after reliable PECsw values are established. The risk to mammals is considered to be low for the representative uses evaluated, except the risk to insectivorous mammals and earthworm-eating mammals for the use in Southern Europe (tomato). The risk from plant metabolites was considered to be addressed by the risk assessment for the parent napropamide. The risk from plant metabolites was considered to be addressed by the risk assessment for the parent napropamide.        Napropamide is very toxic to aquatic organisms. The risk assessment for aquatic organisms is driven by the toxicity to Lemna gibba. The refinement based on a study containing sediment in the test system was not accepted by the experts in the PRAPeR meeting. The endpoints to be used in the risk assessment were discussed since several studies with Lemna species and different aquatic invertebrate species were available. The experts suggested using in the aquatic risk assessment the endpoints of 0.067 mg a.s./L and a geometric mean value of 5.4 mg a.s./L for macrophytes and invertebrates, respectively. No conclusion can be drawn on the risk to aquatic organisms since no reliable PECsw values were established. A high risk to aquatic organisms cannot be excluded for the representative uses of napropamide. No major metabolites in surface water were identified in the water/sediment study. However, the fate experts agreed that the parent as well as 5 different photolysis metabolites and NOPA (where groundwater becomes surface water) should be considered for risk assessment The risk of bioconcentration in fish was assessed as low. The risk to earthworms and soil non-target micro-organisms was assessed as low for the uses in Northern Europe but is not finalised for the use in Southern Europe. A high risk to soil functioning (organic matter breakdown) was indicated by the available litter-bag study since effects of >10% were observed until one year after application of napropamide and further refinement of the risk assessment is necessary.        The risk to bees, non-target arthropods and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.

rayyan-1227191435,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fenpropidin,2008,1,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,1,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Fenpropidin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fenpropidin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 24 June 2005. The peer review was initiated on 23 March 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in January - February 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2007.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 14 November 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide on cereals full details of the gap can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Tern 750 EC"", an emulsifiable concentrate formulation (EC). Fenpropidin is a racemic mixture. It has been identified that more information is necessary to enable the impact of potential different isomer ratios on the risk assessments to be better characterised.        Adequate methods are available to monitor fenpropidin (and its salts expressed as fenpropidin) in products of plant origin, soil water and air and fenpropidin (and its salts expressed as fenpropidin) and CGA 2892672 in products of animal origin. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There is an outstanding data requirement for a sprayability study to address the poor emulsion stability of the formulation.        In mammalian toxicity testing, fenpropidin is acutely toxic via ingestion and inhalation (LD50 1452 mg/kg bw and LC50 1.22 mg/L). It is not acutely toxic via dermal route. It is irritant to skin and eyes but not corrosive. It is a skin sensitiser in both the Buehler and Maximization tests. Classification with Xn R20/22 (harmful by inhalation and if swallowed), Xi R38 (irritating to skin), R41 (risk of serious damage to eyes) and R43 (may cause sensitisation by skin contact) is proposed. According to a 28-day inhalation study showing irritating effects to the respiratory system, classification of fenpropidin as R37 (""irritating to the respiratory system"") is warranted. The relevant NOAEL for short term toxicity in rats is 1.14 mg/kg bw/day, whereas in dogs is 2 mg/kg bw/day, based irritative effects and liver effects, respectively. Fenpropidin does not show any potential for genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and potential toxicity. The relevant long term NOAEL is 2.27 mg/kg bw/day based on decreased body weight; maternal and offspring NOAELs are 8 and 18 mg/kg bw/day, respectively, whereas the reproductive NOAEL is 9 mg/kg bw/day. The relevant maternal and developmental NOAELs are 90 and 12 mg/kg bw/day in rats and rabbits, respectively. Fenpropidin showed a neurotoxic potential in the repeated dose studies, expressed as spinal chord demyelination at the maximum doses tested in a 90-day rat and 1-year dog study. The NOAELs were 5 mg/kg bw/day in dogs and 10.1 mg/kg bw/day in rats. The ADI, AOEL and ARfD are 0.02 mg/kg bw/day (SF 100). The operator exposure of fenpropidin in field crop scenario with a tractor mounted hydraulic boom sprayer shows exposure levels below the AOEL when appropriate PPE is worn (gloves during mixing/loading and sturdy footwear and coveralls during application). Workers and bystanders show exposure levels below the AOEL under worst case assessments (67% with PPE and 4.5%, respectively).        The metabolic pathway of fenpropidin in cereals has been elucidated. Several routes of metabolism have been identified but the metabolic pattern in wheat grain and straw at plant maturity is clearly dominated by the parent compound. Therefore the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring in cereals is restricted to fenpropidin.        Supervised residue trials conducted in Northern Europe support the setting of MRLs of 0.1 mg/kg in wheat, rye and triticale and of 0.3 mg/kg in barley and oats. High residue levels were found in straw. Under processing the nature of fenpropidin residues is not affected and residues are preferentially transferred to bran during the milling process. The transfer factor from barley to beer could not be determined exactly but is below 0.4.        A transfer of soil residues to rotational crops after cereal use is not expected.        A significant exposure of livestock mainly resulting from consumption of straw is expected. Animal metabolism studies in lactating goats and laying hens show that fenpropidin is extensively metabolised in livestock and a complex residue pattern is found in edible tissues. The residue definition for monitoring animal commodities consists in the sum of fenpropidin and one of its major animal metabolites (CGA 289267). For risk assessment, further major metabolites need to be considered and conversion factors between both definitions have been proposed. A feeding study in dairy cows has been conducted and can be used for MRL setting in animal products. Chronic and acute consumer exposure assessments were conducted and, under restriction of an uncertainty related to the isomer ratio consumer is actually exposed to, did not show any indication of dietary risk.        In soil under aerobic conditions fenpropidin exhibits moderate to high persistence and has the potential to accumulate when used in successive years. When it degrades it forms the major soil metabolite CGA 289267 (accounting for a maximum 10.6% of applied radioactivity (AR) at 8 degrees C) which exhibits low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of the benzylic bridge radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted for 16-32% AR after 90-92 days (22 degrees C). The formation of unextractable residues accounted for 9-19 % AR after 90-92 days. Fenpropidin is immobile or exhibits slight mobility in soil, CGA 289267 exhibits high to medium mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either fenpropidin or CGA 289267 was pH dependant.        In dark natural sediment water systems fenpropidin degraded exhibiting moderate to medium persistence to the metabolite CGA 289267 found primarily in the water of the system (maximum 1314% AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for 11-60 % AR at 84 days (study end, benzylic bridge radiolabel). Unextracted sediment residues a minor sink representing around 8 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for fenpropidin at steps 3 & 4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolite CGA 289267 appropriate FOCUS step 3 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. There is the potential for short range atmospheric deposition to surface water from fenpropidin that may volatilise at the time of application and from plant surfaces for around 24 hours after application.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by fenpropidin and its soil metabolite CGA 289267 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        The first-tier risk assessment for birds resulted in TERs below the Annex VI trigger for the acute scenario in the Northern European GAP and in the long-term scenarios in the Northern and Southern European GAPs. Measured residue values and the focal skylark (Alauda arvensis) and yellowhammer (Motacilla flava) were agreed by the experts to be used in the refined risk assessment but not the suggested PT values. The acute TER for herbivorous birds was > 10 based on maximum initial measured residues. The meeting agreed to take into account in the long-term risk assessment that cereals would become not attractive as a food source for herbivorous birds and mammals soon after the first application when stem elongation starts. The reduction of residues in insects based on general considerations of growth of insect populations was not accepted since it was not based on measured residues. A more detailed consideration of insect populations in the relevant crop would be required before a scientifically sound and robust estimation of residue decline could be made. The FOCUS based interception factor of 0.5 for residues on weed seeds was rejected since weeds may have a similar or larger height as the crop during early cereal growth stages and extrapolation from deposition on soil surface was considered as not correct. A data gap was identified to refine the longterm risk assessment for herbivorous birds and insectivorous birds (Northern and Southern European uses).        The Annex VI trigger was met for insectivorous mammals but breached in the first-tier acute and long-term risk assessment for herbivorous mammals. The suggest PT to refine the risk was not sufficiently supported by data and hence rejected. However based on accepted measured residue values the refined risk assessment resulted in TERs above the trigger indicating a low risk from the representative uses evaluated.        The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low. The acute TERs for exposure to contaminated drinking water based on the 5-fold dilution of the sprayed solution resulted in TERs < 10 for birds. Further information on the drinking behaviour of birds was not submitted leaving some uncertainty via this route of exposure. However the application is to cereals and hence the formation of leaf puddles is unlikely.        Algae were the most sensitive group of aquatic organisms driving the aquatic risk assessment. The risk assessment was based on an endpoint from a mesocosm study. The proposed NOEAEC of 6.8 mu g fenpropin/L was not agreed because long-lasting effects on Chlorophyceae were observed at a concentration of 1.4 mu g fenpropidin/L. The meeting agreed on a NOEC of 0.39 mu g fenpropidin/L (based on mean measured initial concentrations). It was suggested by the meeting of experts that an assessment factor of 1-3 should be applied at Member State level depending on the representativeness of the mesocosm to the local environmental conditions in the agricultural landscape. In the updated addendum of September 2007 (not peer-reviewed) the RMS recalculated the TERs based on FOCUS step 4 PECsw. With a no-spray buffer zone of 50 metres the TERs were above 1 in all drainage scenarios out of 6 but below 1 in all run-off scenarios. No full FOCUS step 4 scenario resulted in TERs > 3. The risk from metabolite CGA 289267 to aquatic organisms was assessed as low.        Predatory mites were the most sensititve group of non-target terrestrial arthropods tested. Extended laboratory studies indicated a high in-field risk but also a potential of recolonisation due to rapid residue decline. The available studies did not cover the off-field exposure rates for Phytoseilus persimilis. An in-field no-spray buffer zone of 5 metres is required to achieve a rate low enough to conclude on a low risk to predatory mites based on the available studies.        The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. The long-term TER for the Northern European use was calculated as 4.6. Since the TER value is not far below the trigger of 5 and the TER is based on very conservative PECsoil calculations (accumulation for 20 years) the experts agreed that the longterm risk to earthworms is low.

rayyan-1227191436,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance quinoclamine,2007,12,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,5,12,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Quinoclamine is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on quinoclamine in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 June 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 11 January 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Agro-Kanesho Co. Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in October-November 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 25 September 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide/algaecide on ornamentals, turf, lawns and nursery stock plants as proposed by the applicant, full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Mogeton"", a wettable powder (WP) containing 250 g/kg of active substance. Methods are not required for food of plant or animal origin as the use is on ornamentals, turf, lawns and nursery stock plants. Adequate methods are available to monitor quinoclamine in soil, drinking water and air. A confirmatory method for surface water was identified as a data gap in the meeting of experts. A confirmatory method for surface water has been provided by the applicant but it has not been evaluated and therefore is not peer reviewed.        Some analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. However, a method of analysis for the relevant impurity dichlone (2,3-dichloro-1,4naphthoquinone) is not available.        The acute oral toxicity of quinoclamine is moderate (R22 Harmful if swallowed) but the acute toxicity by inhalation or dermal application is low. The substance is irritating to the eyes (R36 Irritant to eyes) but not to the skin, and has sensitizing properties (R43 May cause sensitization by skin contact). Indications of haemolytic anaemia are observed in the short term studies in rats and dogs. Quinoclamine does not show a genotoxic or carcinogenic potential, but some teratogenic effects were observed and lead to the proposed classification Repro cat. 3, R63 Possible risk of harm to the unborn child. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.002 mg/kg bw/day, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.03 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.05 mg/kg bw. The dermal absorption values are 6.52% for the concentrate and the low dilution, and 10% for the high dilution. The operator exposure estimates in field or greenhouse are below the AOEL only when personal protective equipment is used. Preliminary estimates of children exposure show that the AOEL might be exceeded when the exposure occurs on the day of treatment.        Very high residue levels are present on grass directly after application of quinoclamine. A metabolism study demonstrated that parent compound is the main constituent of the residue on grass up to 2 weeks after application. Therefore only quinoclamine needs to be considered for risk assessment related to humans and terrestrial vertebrates in contact with treated lawn and turf. One decline study demonstrated that residues decrease rapidly in favourable condition of grass growth. Also grass clipping results in low residues in regrown grass. Nevertheless it cannot be excluded that the decline of residues in grass may be significantly slower when growth rate of grass due to environmental conditions is weak. The need for further studies should therefore be considered at national level.        As a risk-mitigation measure related to human and wildlife exposure, label should give the user clear recommendations to apply the product in strong growing conditions of grass, and practical instructions to irrigate efficiently the treated area in case of low precipitation level, in accordance with the biological efficiency of the product.        Quinoclamine is moderately persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C and produces a number of minor metabolites (< 5 % AR). Quinoclamine ultimately degrades to non extractable residues and mineralizes to CO2.        Under dark anaerobic conditions at 20 degrees C, quinoclamine is low persistent and yields two main metabolites: AN and DHN.        Light may enhance the degradation of quinoclamine but its contribution to overall degradation in soil is deemed low due to the rapid microbiological degradation.        A field study is available where Mogeton 25WP (15 Kg /ha; 3.75 Kg a. s. /ha) was applied in four sites (two in spring and two in autumn) in Germany on bare soil. Only data from the spring trials was found relevant for the representative uses applied at EU level (spring application). PEC soil were calculated based on the field worst case spring application half life (DT50 = 29 d). The expert's meeting agreed that for uses in autumn longer dissipation pattern observed in autumn field trials would need to be considered. In that case, new kinetic analysis of the two autumn field studies would be necessary.        Quinoclamine may be considered low mobile in soil according the batch adsorption/desorption studies available.        According the available study quinoclamine is expected to be stable to hydrolysis under environmental conditions (pH 4-9, 20 degrees C).        According the aqueous photolysis study available in the original dossier quinoclamine has a short half life in water under irradiated conditions (2.2 d, corresponding to 4.2 d with 12 h irradiation per day in UK). A data gap was identified during the peer review for further information on non identified photolysis metabolites. In a new study, photolysis was slower. Two major photolysis metabolites were identified: phthalic acid and 2-carboxybenzaldehide. The two major photolysis metabolites were considered by the RMS in the updated risk assessment presented in the addendum. According the available study quinoclamine is not ready biodegradable.        In dark water /sediment at 20 degrees C, quinoclamine partitioned to the sediment and degraded in whole system with a first order half life of 14-15 d. Metabolite AN reached levels above 10 % AR in the sediment.        For the assessment of the representative use in lawns/turf, PECSW were calculated with the FOCUS SW scheme up to Step 3 using whole water /sediment degradation half lives. Only global maximum PECSW have been used in the risk assessment. Based on this PECSW calculation a risk for aquatic organisms was identified.        The FOCUS SW Step 4 calculations presented by the notifier were not found acceptable because input parameters employed deviated from those recommended by the RMS and agreed by the peer review and/or due to the implementation of additional mitigation by VFS or by spray shields. Also the experts in the meeting agreed that for uses on turf (particularly golf courses and other sport facilities) drainage should be considered a potential route of entry to surface water. However, the meeting agreed that available Step 4 calculations give an indication that significant mitigation regarding run off and spray drift will be necessary to mitigate risk to aquatic environment for the proposed representative use in turf /lawn. Applicant proposed that potential surface water contamination due to use in ornamental plants in pots may be managed in a way that contamination of surface water will be negligible. RMS calculated spray drift PECSW for the use on pots outdoor. During the experts meeting, it was indicated that in the case of pots standing in a hard surface high potential of surface water contamination as a consequence of run off is also possible. As there is not agreed way of dealing with run off from hard surfaces at EU level, it was agreed that this issue would have to be addressed a MS level.        Potential contamination of ground water for the use in turf was addressed following the FOCUS GW scheme with FOCUS PRZM (v 3.2.1. b). The resulting 80th percentile annual average concentrations of quinoclamine at 1m depth were below 0.001 mu g / L in all the FOCUS GW scenarios. Due to the low potential of volatilization and the estimated rapid photochemical transformation, the environmental concentrations in air and the transport through air are considered negligible.        The representative uses of quinoclamine are against algae and mosses in lawns/turf, ornamentals (outdoors) and nursery stock plants (out-and indoor). The risk assessment was focussed on the use in lawns and turf. Exposure of birds and mammals from the outdoor use in ornamentals was considered as negligible. The first-tier TERs for large herbivorous and small insectivorous birds were below the triggers of 10 and 5. The risk refinements based on residue decline in grass was accepted by the experts. However other suggested refinements were rejected and further data are required to refine the short-term risk to herbivorous birds, the short-term and long-term risk to insectivorous birds. The acute and long-term TERs for herbivorous mammals were below the triggers of 10 and 5. The refined long-term TER based on residue decline was calculated as 5.8. However the acute risk to mammals needs to be addressed further. Fish and daphnids were the most sensitive aquatic organisms triggering the acute and long-term risk assessment. No-spray buffer zones of up to 100 m are not sufficient as a risk mitigation measure to achieve TERs above the Annex VI triggers for the use in lawns/turf. The TER calculation of the RMS for the outdoor use in ornamentals and nursery stock plants indicated that a distance of 20m is not sufficient to mitigate the risk. However no agreed exposure scenario exists for the outdoor use in ornamentals and nursery stock plants. Therefore it was agreed that a risk assessment should be conducted at Member state level. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil-micro organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low.

One representative isolate per genera was selected for evaluating the biodegradative potential under laboratory scale and phenotypically characterized. Removal of individual PCB congeners was between 35.6% and 79.8% at 4 degrees C and between 0.4% and 82.8% at 15 degrees C. Differences in the removal patterns of PCB congeners were observed in relation to the phylogenetic affiliation: Arthrobacter isolate showed similar biodegradation efficiencies when growing at 4 degrees C and 15 degrees C while Pseudoalteromonas better degraded PCBs at 15 degrees C. No biodegradation was detected for Psychrobacter isolate at 4 degrees C.

rayyan-1227191439,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance prosulfocarb,2007,8,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,5,8,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Prosulfocarb is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on prosulfocarb in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 20 April 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 7 October 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed during a written procedure in August September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January 2007.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 27 June 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a pre emergence or early post -emergence herbicide as proposed by the notifier which comprise conventional field crop spraying to control grass weeds (Apera spica-venti, Poa annua, Poa trivialis, Alopecurus myosuroides, Lolium multi/Thrum) and broad-leaved weeds (Galium aparine, Stellaria media, Lamium purpureum, Fumaria officinalis, Solanum nigrum, Atriplex patula, Chenopodium album, Thlaspi arvense, Veronica spp., Capsella bursa-pastoris, Myosotis arvensis, Anthemis spp., Viola arvensis) in winter wheat and potatoes (a maximum rate of 4 kg as/ha). The representative formulated products for the evaluation was ""Boxer"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 800 g/L prosulfocarb.        The technical specification is still open waiting for confirmatory data.        Adequate methods are available to monitor prosulfocarb in the respective residue definitions. Residues of prosulfocarb in food and feed of plant origin can be determined by a multi method (DFG Method-S19) using GC-MSD and in soil, water and air by GC-MSD. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        The acute oral toxicity of prosulfocarb is moderate while the acute dermal or inhalation toxicity is low. Slight signs of skin-and ocular irritation were noted in rabbits, and skin sensitisation was shown in mice. In short-term toxicity studies, liver and kidney were found to be the target organs in rats and dogs. In addition, haemolytic anaemia was observed in dogs, with associated histopathological findings in the bone marrow and spleen. Available data do not support evidence of genotoxic or carcinogenic effects. In long-term toxicity studies, mainly reduced food consumption and decreased body weights were noted. No toxic effect on the reproductive parameters was demonstrated. However, there was some evidence of teratogenic potential but no convincing evidence for classification and adequate margins of safety were shown for the reference values. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.005 mg/kg bw/d, the Acceptable Operator Exposure (AOEL) is 0.007 mg/kg bw/d and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.1 mg/kg bw. The level of operator exposure is below the AOEL with the use of personal protective equipment according to a field study.        Applied according to the representative uses in wheat and potatoes, prosulfocarb is extensively metabolised and in mature commodities no metabolite structurally related to the compound was identified. The ultimate degradation products are expected to be incorporated in the endogenous metabolism of the plant. The residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment is proposed to consist per default in prosulfocarb. MRLs for wheat and potatoes can be set at the Limit of Quantification. No residues are expected in rotational crops, processed plant commodities and in animal commodities. No risk for the consumer resulting from the use of prosulfocarb according to the representative uses is expected.        In soil under aerobic conditions prosulfocarb exhibits low to moderate persistence forming the minor soil metabolite prosulfocarb sulfoxide2 (observed in studies at a maximum of 7.2% of prosulfocarb on a mass basis) which exhibits low persistence. Mineralisation to carbon dioxide accounted for 38 % of applied radioactivity (AR) after 96 days. The formation of unextractable residues was also a significant sink accounting for 27 % AR after 96 days. Under anaerobic soil conditions degradation was slower than under aerobic conditions but no novel breakdown products were identified. Prosulfocarb exhibits low to slight mobility in soil, prosulfocarb sulfoxide exhibits high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either prosulfocarb or prosulfocarb sulfoxide was pH dependant.        In natural sediment water systems prosulfocarb dissipated quite rapidly from water by partitioning to sediment where it subsequently degraded slowly exhibiting high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was the only significant degradation product accounting for 15-25 % AR at 70-107 days. Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink for radioactivity representing 7.3-23 % AR at study end (107 days). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for prosulfocarb at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. Additionally at step 4, for the runoff scenarios the applicant presented calculations where both spray drift and runoff were mitigated.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.41g/L by parent prosulfocarb and its minor soil metabolite prosulfocarb sulfoxide, was concluded to be low, in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        The first-tier acute and short-term TERs for birds were above the trigger value of 10 but the longterm trigger of 5 was breached. The suggested risk refinements based on rate of decline of residues in plants, focal species and proportion of different food items in the diet (PD) were agreed in the meeting of experts. For mammals, the first tier acute TER was below the trigger of 10 for the small herbivore and all first tier long-term TERs were below the trigger of 5. As for birds, the refined risk assessment for mammals, based on rate of decline of residues in plants, focal species and proportion of different food items in the diet (PD), were agreed in the meeting of experts. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water was considered to be low since exposure of birds and mammals from contaminated drinking water was expected to be low. The accumulation of water in leaf axils and puddle formation were considered as unlikely since the product is applied at very early growth stages and sprayed at low volumes. A potential high risk was indicated for earthworm-eating birds and mammals. The refined risk assessment based on measured residues in earthworms resulted in TERs above the trigger of 5. The TERs for fish, daphnids and algae were about one order of magnitude below the trigger values of 100 and 10 based on FOCUS step 2 PECsw. No full FOCUS step3 scenario resulted in PECsw values low enough to achieve TERs above the Annex VI triggers for all groups of aquatic organisms.        Based on endpoints from laboratory studies, TERs below the Annex VI triggers were observed with FOCUS step 4 PECsw (10 m no spray buffer zone) in the scenarios D1, D2, D4, D5, D6, R1, R3, R4 (8 out of 9) for the use in winter wheat and in the scenarios R1, R2, R3 (3 out of 6) for the use in potato. Therefore it is concluded that a 10 m no-spray buffer zone is not sufficient as a risk mitigation measure in the majority of geoclimatic conditions represented by the FOCUS scenarios. Two mesocosm studies were submitted to refine the risk to aquatic organisms. The robustness of the results of the first study was questioned during the peer-review process. The experts in the PRAPeR meeting agreed that a NOEAEC of 15 fig prosulfocarb/L could be derived from the new mesocosm study. No agreement was reached during the expert meeting on the safety factor which should be applied to the endpoint. If a safety factor of >3 is applied then the NOEAEC of 15 fig prosulfocarb/L would become the critical endpoint driving the risk assessment. The HQ values indicated a potential high in-field and off-field risk to non-target arthropods. Extended laboratory studies resulted in LR50s below the suggested application rate of 4 kg prosulfocarb/ha but the LR50s were higher than the expected exposure at lm distance from the treated field. Therefore it was concluded by the expert meeting that recolonisation of the in-field area is likely to occur and the overall risk to non-target arthropods is sufficiently addressed. The TER values for non-target plants were calculated as 3 and 28 for pre-and post-emergence treatment. The use of an interception factor to estimate the pre emergence exposure and the suggested lowering of the safety factor was not agreed by the expert meeting. Risk mitigation measures such as an in-field no spray buffer zone of 5 m was recommended. The risk to bees, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated.

Azamethiphos is an organophosphate (OP) pesticide used to combat sea lice infestations in farmed salmonids. Here, the sublethal impact on the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, of short term exposure to azamethiphos was determined. The testing regime included biomarkers of exposure (acetylcholinesterase activity), cytotoxicity (neutral red retention), immune function (phagocytic index) and physiological condition (feeding rate). The distribution and sensitivity of M. edulis acetylcholinesterase to inhibition by azamethiphos was first determined, yielding IC50 values of 0.736 and 1.30 mg l(-1) for gill and haemolymph, respectively. Exposure of mussels to 0.1 mg l(-1) azamethiphos for periods of up to 24 h caused a significant reduction in acetylcholinesterase activity in both the haemolymph (P < 0.0002) and the gill (P < 0.002), alteration in cell viability (P < 0.02) and decrease in phagocytic index (P < 0.03). The feeding rate remained unaffected. The results support the hypothesis that, in addition to its neurotoxic effects, azamethiphos can modulate haemocyte function and immune defence in M. edulis at environmentally relevant concentrations after only a few hours.

rayyan-1227191441,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance haloxyfop-P (haloxyfop-R) finalised: 28 July 2006,2006,9,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,4,9,,EFSA,,English,,,"Although, in general, the Commission is using the ISO common names for the active substances, in this case the synonym haloxyfop-R (introduced by DOW AgroSciences) is used, which is in common use, but has no official status. However, to minimise confusion and misunderstandings the name haloxyfop-R is used in the EFSA conclusion, being aware that this is not in compliance with the general approach of the Commission.        Haloxyfop-R is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on haloxyfop-R in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 21 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 26 March 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 27 September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.        Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on haloxyfop-R in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 21 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 26 March 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 27 September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 9 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying to control annual and perennial grasses in carrots, fodder legumes (peas and beans), rape seed, soy bean and sugar beet at a maximum application rate up to 0.104 kg haloxyfop-R per hectare. Only the use as herbicide was evaluated during the EU peer review process.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""EF-1400"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Europe.        Whether or not sufficient enforcement methods are available for monitoring purposes depends on the final residue definitions. The reason is that none of the submitted method is enantio selective. The residues are determined as a sum parameter of both, the R- and the S-isomer. This means that for the determination of haloxyfop-R no specific enforcement method would be available.        Furthermore, it should be noted that with the available analytical methods for food, soil and water it is not possible to differentiate between residue of the acid and its salts, esters and conjugates.        Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        The toxicological studies were generally performed with pure (>98%) racemic haloxyfop or haloxyfop-R methyl ester or with neat substances. The toxicokinetic studies indicate that absorbed methyl ester will rapidly be hydrolysed to the parent acid and the S-form haloxyfop present in racemic haloxyfop will instantaneously undergo stereochemical inversion to haloxyfop-R. Therefore, the various compounds used for testing are assumed to elicit the same systemic effects following administration and these effects can be attributed to haloxyfop-R. The absorption is rapid (> 80%) and the excretion extensive. The acute oral toxicity is moderate i.e. LD50 is around 300 mg/kg bw and the dermal toxicity low LD50> 2000 mg/kg bw, proposed classification of Xn, R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"". No acute inhalation toxicity studies are available. Neither racemic haloxyfop nor haloxyfop-R methyl ester was irritating to skin and haloxyfop-R methyl ester was not a sensitizer. Haloxyfop-R methyl ester is not irritating to the eye whereas racemic haloxyfop induced signs of irritation in the conjunctival sacs and iris and caused corneal opacity covering up to 100% of the cornea in all animals. Signs of irritation (corneal opacity) persisted for 21 days in un-rinsed eyes racemic haloxyfop is therefore irritating to the eye and the classification of Xi; R41 ""Risk of serious damage to eyes"" is proposed. The relevant short term NOAEL is 0.5 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study which would also be said to cover the effects observed in the 90-day studies in the dog and monkey at 2 mg/kg bw/day.        There is no mutagenic or genotoxic potential for haloxyfop-R. Haloxyfop is not carcinogenic in the rat but there are hepatocellular adenomas in the highest dose in the mice associated with peroxisome proliferation.        No reproductive effects were observed at the highest dose level of 1 mg/kg bw/day, thus being a NOAEL for reproductive effects, the NOAEL for offspring toxicity is 0.065 mg/kg bw/day based on decreased body weight of f(1a) pups after 21 days at 1 mg/kg bw/day.        The NOAEL for maternal effects is 7.5 mg/kg bw/day and the NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 7.5 mg/kg bw/day in the first study and 15 mg/kg bw/day in the second study.        No specific studies are available for the metabolites.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.00065 mg/kg bw/day, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.005 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.075 mg/kg bw/day, with the safety factor of 100 applied.        The operator exposure was estimated using the standard models UK-POEM and the German model. The dermal absorption is 7% and 12% for the concentrate and the diluted product, respectively. The AOEL is exceeded (169%) according to the UK-POEM even with PPE (coverall) but is below according to the German model if PPE (coverall and gloves) is applied (12%). The estimated worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL.        To investigate the residue behaviour of haloxyfop-R in plants and livestock either the haloxyfop R-isomer or the unresolved isomeric mixture or ester variants of both compounds were used.        Plant metabolism was studied following foliar application to crops representing leafy crops, root vegetables, pulses and oilseeds. Irrespective of the ester variant or whether the racemic mixture or only the R-isomer was applied, the metabolism in all the studied crops was found to be similar commencing by a rapid and almost complete degradation to haloxyfop (R,S) very soon after application, followed by conjugation with carbohydrates and triglycerides. These conjugates appeared to be unstable under alkaline and acidic conditions, releasing haloxyfop (R,S) again.        Metabolism studies with goats and hens indicated that haloxyfop (R,S) is excreted unmetabolised by livestock animals. In tissue and organs residues were present as haloxyfop (R,S) in either form, free and conjugated.        Due to the lacking isomeric specificity of the pre-registration analytical methods any possible stereochemical inversion in either direction in food of plant and animal origin could not be detected, even though it is assumed based on available data in soil and in rats that if such inversion occurs it will be most likely from the S- to the R-isomer.        A sufficient number of residue trial data with haloxyfop-R methyl according to the GAP proposed for the representative uses is available to conclude the risk assessment for consumers and to propose MRLs. From crop rotation studies it can be concluded that no significant residue levels are expected in rotational and succeeding crops following application of haloxyfop-R methyl according to the critical GAP. The residue levels that could occur in food of animal origin when crops treated with haloxyfop-R methyl are fed to animals were assessed based on livestock feeding studies and MRLs have been proposed.        The dietary risk assessment performed for different consumer groups indicates that there are no chronic and acute concerns related to dietary exposure resulting from the representative uses assessed within the peer review procedure.        Soil degradation studies suggested a possible main degradation route for haloxyfop-R methyl ester under aerobic conditions. Haloxyfop-R methyl ester degraded rapidly (DT50 < 0.6 d at 20 degrees C) in six soils to produce the acid metabolite haloxyfop-R-3 (maxima concentrations ranged from 53 to 91% AR), which further degraded to DE-535 pyridinol(4) (max. 29-52% AR). Other two metabolites, DE-535 pyridinone(5) and DE-535 phenol(6), exceeded the trigger value of 10% AR on a limited number of occasions: DE-535 pyridinone reached a maximum of 11.0% AR after 120 days, and DE-535 phenol with maximum concentration of 12.6% AR after 14 days. Final degradation ended up in minor unidentified metabolites, non-extractable soil residues (max. 44% AR after 90 days) and carbon dioxide (max. 35% AR after 90 days). Haloxyfop-R can be considered as very low to low persistent, DE-535 pyridinol as medium to high persistent, DE-535 phenol as moderate to high persistent and DE-535 pyridinone as high persistent.        Sorption characteristics indicated that haloxyfop-R, DE-535 pyridinol and DE-535 pyridinone are very high to high mobile in soil, whereas DE-535 phenol can be classified as low mobile. Haloxyfop-R and the metabolite trifluoroacetic acid exceeded the limit value of 0.1 mu g/L on individual occasions in some lysimeter studies, but the annual average concentrations were < 0.1 mu g/L for haloxyfop-R methyl ester and all its metabolites.        Because the calculation model for PECsoil was not consistent with the method used for the degradation rates values, soil concentrations at later time points for haloxyfop-R, DE-535 phenol and DE-535 pyridinone should be recalculated. However, the new PECsoil values will not have an impact on the risk assessment for terrestrial organisms as safe uses have been shown using the reliable initial PECsoil.        The hydrolysis rate of haloxyfop-R methyl ester was directly correlated with pH (stable at pH 4, DT50=43 days at pH 7 and DT50= 0.63 days at pH 9). The photolysis of haloxyfop-R methyl ester and haloxyfop-R was investigated in pH 5 sterile buffer and natural water (pH 8.5). A new metabolite, with a chemical structure similar to dibenzofuran, was identified up to 18.6% AR in the sterile buffer system. Because a final conclusion on the ecotoxicological and toxicological relevance of this metabolite can not be drawn, the aquatic exposure of DE-535 furan needs to be addressed.        Two natural water-sediment systems under controlled laboratory conditions showed that haloxyfop-R methyl ester was rapidly hydrolyzed to haloxyfop-R, the concentrations of which were in the range of 63.8 - 81.5% AR after 1-30 days. At the same time the concentration of the metabolite DE-535 pyridinol increased up to 19.7% AR after 59 days. The same two metabolites were also found in the sediment phase up to 33.7% AR (haloxyfop-R) and 16.4% AR (DE-535 pyridinol). Haloxyfop-R methyl ester degraded rapidly in both the water and sediment phases with first order DT50 values < 0.3 days. The calculated DT50 values for haloxyfop-R ranged from 39.2 - 51.7 d (whole system) and from 31.5-54.6 d (water phase).        The available aquatic exposure assessment is appropriate for addressing the spray drift route on entry to surface water for haloxyfop-R methyl ester, haloxyfop-R and DE-535 pyridinol. Additional calculations were performed including a worst-case contamination contribution from run-off and drainage of 15% of the application rate.        The available FOCUS groundwater modelling indicated that there is a high potential of groundwater contamination from the metabolites DE-535 pyridinol (80th percentile annual average concentrations: 0.55-2.87 mu g/L) and DE-535 pyridinone (0.26-0.90 mu g/L) under vulnerable situations for all the 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However, the DT50 values used in the modelling were derived with a method not compatible with the method assumed by the PELMO model as recommended by the FOCUS group. Therefore, the values presented in this conclusion should be taken with caution and should be confirmed by an appropriate FOCUS groundwater modelling. Pending the outcome, an evaluation of the relevance of the metabolites following the guidance document on relevant metabolites has to be completed. In the case the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L or 0.75 mu g/L is exceeded there is a need to provide information on the toxicological properties and possibly consumer risk assessment.        Based on the available volatilisation experiment and the calculated atmospheric half-life, contamination of the air compartment and long range transport through air are not expected.        The first tier risk assessment for herbivorous and insectivorous birds resulted in TER values above the Annex VI trigger indicating a low risk. For medium herbivorous and insectivorous mammals the acute risk is considered to be low, while a first tier high long-term risk was identified. The MS experts did not accept a proposed refinement using a higher endpoint from a 16-week dietary study. It was agreed to use the endpoint of 1 mg/kg bw/day from a 2-generation reproduction study. Furthermore, since the half-life for residues in vegetation was observed to be longer than the default value, residue decline data for each crop should be used in the risk assessment. The resulting TER values are foreseen to be below the Annex VI trigger indicating a high risk, and the risk to mammals needs to be further addressed.        Haloxyfop-R methyl ester is very toxic to aquatic organisms, fish being the most sensitive group of organisms. Risk mitigation comparable to 5 m buffer zones is required to meet the Annex VI trigger. The risk to aquatic organisms from the surface water metabolites haloxyfop-R and DE-535 pyridinol is considered to be low, except for sediment dwelling organisms for which a reproduction study with Chironomus riparius using DE-535 pyridinol is required before a full conclusion can be drawn. No information on the toxicity of the photolysis metabolite DE-535 furan is available. If an assumption of ten times higher toxicity compared to haloxyfop-R methyl ester were applied, the resulting TER value would be below the Annex VI acute trigger. Thus data to address the toxicity of this metabolite to aquatic organism is considered necessary. Two metabolites were found in concentrations >0.1 mu g/L in the FOCUS ground water modelling. DE-535 pyridinol is considered to be of no ecotoxicological relevance. A conclusion regarding the relevance of DE-535 pyridinone can only be drawn once available studies have been evaluated.        The risk to bees and other non-target arthropods is low. The risk to earthworms, other soil macro-organisms and soil micro-organisms from haloxyfop-R methyl ester and haloxyfop-R is considered to be low. However, the risk to soil organisms from exposure to the persistent soil metabolites DE-535 pyridinol, DE-pyridinone and DE-535 phenol needs to be addressed. The risk to biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low. No evaluated studies are available to conclude on the risk to non-target plants.

rayyan-1227191442,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance phosmet,2006,6,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,4,6,,ESFA,,English,,,"Phosmet is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on phosmet in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 23 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 03 September 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Margarita Internacional. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6 April 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an acaracide and insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises tractor-mounted spraying and airblast assisted sprayers in orchards. Application is made to citrus fruit at a rate of 0.5 kg phosmet per hectare, pome fruit at 0.3 kg phosmet per hectare and potatoes at 0.5 kg phosmet per hectare. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Imidan 50 WP a wettable powder (WP) registered under different trade names in Europe. The representative uses assessed were located in southern Europe only as stated in the application for annex 1 listing. No conclusion on the equivalence of the two sources could be made as some mammalian toxicology data were missing.        In the main adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. The residue definition for water can not be finalised due to outstanding ecotoxicology data. The method for body fluids and tissues is currently only validated for phosmet and as the oxon is in the residue definition further validation data will be required. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Limited analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are some outstanding issues related to the relevant impurities.        The toxicological risk assessment is based on the assumption that the studies have been performed with a test material that covers the current technical specification. The absorption is rapid and almost complete, there is no accumulation in tissues and the excretion is mainly via urine. Phosmet is toxic by oral administration and the proposed classification is T, R25. It is non-irritant to skin and eyes and does not cause sensitisation by skin contact. The critical effect after repeated exposure is depression of the plasma, erythrocyte and brain acetylcholinesterase activities. The most sensitive species is the dog. Phosmet is an in vitro but not in vivo genotoxic agent. Increased incidence of liver tumours is observed in mice at the highest dose level (14 mg/kg bw/day), higher than controls but within the same range as historical control data. In a two-generation study with rats, the fertility parameters and the offspring are not directly affected. Phosmet shows no evidence of teratogenicity in rat or rabbits, and no potential to induce delayed neurotoxicity. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.003 mg/kg/day, based on a LOAEL of 1 mg/kg bw/day and an additional safety factor of 3. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.045 mg/kg bw/day and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) 0.02 mg/kg bw/day. For the use on potatoes and pomes, exposure estimates according to the German model are below the AOEL for operators wearing personal protective equipment and respiratory protective equipment. In spite of these high protection measures, the operator exposure is above the AOEL during application on citrus fruits. Estimates of worker and bystander exposure are below the AOEL for all the supported uses.        Plant metabolism studies with 14C-phosmet in cherries, potatoes and corn are available covering the representative uses. A common metabolic pathway is proposed. Phosmet is able to penetrate through the plant surface where the main metabolic reactions take place. Within the plant tissues only a limited transport is observed. The primary metabolic reactions are hydrolysis and conjugation reactions which produce phthalic acid and a range of related compounds, none of them containing the phosphorodithioate group. Oxidation reaction leading to the oxygen analogue phosmet oxon is a minor metabolic reaction. Considering the fact that oxygen analogue compounds are of high toxicity and the fact that no specific information on the toxicological significance of this compound is available, it was concluded to include phosmet oxon in the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring purposes. However, pending on the outcome of the study aimed to address the relative potency of phosmet oxon in comparison with the parent compound, it might be necessary to reconsider the residue definitions.        Supervised residue trials in oranges, apples and potatoes have been submitted, which allow the proposal of the following MRLs: oranges and pome fruit: 0.2 mg/kg, respectively, potatoes: 0.02* mg/kg. No MRLs are proposed for other citrus fruit as the available trials in oranges are not suitable for extrapolation to the whole crop group.        The effects of processing on the nature and the level of residues were investigated. Under conditions simulating pasteurisation, baking/brewing/boiling and sterilisation, phosmet degraded to less toxic compounds or compounds that occurred also in animal metabolism studies. The transfer factors to apple juice, apple pure and canned apples were very low, with residues essentially left in the pomace and peel fractions.        Studies on succeeding or rotational crops are not required due to the fast degradation of phosmet in soil.        Livestock can be exposed to residues of phosmet through consumption of fruit pomace and potatoes. Metabolism studies in lactating goat and laying hens demonstrated that phosmet will not occur in animal tissues, milk and eggs when livestock is fed with feed produced according to GAP for the supported use.        The consumer risk assessment was carried out taking into account chronic and acute exposures according to the provisional residue definition (sum of phosmet and phosmet oxon, expressed as phosmet). The calculations indicate that the exposure will be below the ADI and the ARfD, respectively.        In aerobic laboratory soil degradation studies (20 degrees C, 21-50% soil maximum water holding capacity) phosmet exhibited low persistence and did not form any major (> 10% AR) extractable non volatile soil metabolites. The major sink for the radiolabels used in the experiments was mineralisation to CO2 (53-77% applied radioactivity (AR) at 120-150 days). Residue not extracted by acetone /acidified acetone accounted for 17-38% AR at 150 days. In field dissipation studies carried out in the USA phosmet also exhibited low persistence. Under laboratory (23 degrees C) anaerobic soil conditions the major (14.5% AR) metabolite N-hydroxymethyl phthalamic acid was identified.        Based in the results of laboratory batch adsorption studies phosmet exhibited low mobility being considered immobile in one of the four soils tested. In a BBA guideline lysimeter study carried out in Switzerland that covers the applied for representative uses if applications are made in July, there was no leaching of radioactivity (excluding CO2) in collected leachate samples > 0.06 mu g/L, confirming the results of FOCUS scenario groundwater modelling for parent phosmet and indicating leaching of the soil metabolites that are formed at low levels is unlikely to be significant. All this information indicates, that for the applied for intended uses, the potential for groundwater exposure above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L is negligible.        In laboratory (20 degrees C) natural sediment water systems phosmet both dissipated rapidly by partitioning to sediment and degraded rapidly, resulting in it exhibiting very low persistence. The major (> 10% AR) metabolites identified were: phthalamic acid phthalic acid and N-hydroxymethyl phthalimide. Based on the available sterile hydrolysis studies and laboratory aqueous photolysis study O, O-dimethylphosphorodithioc acid and O, O-dimethylphosphoric acid may also be formed as major metabolites in natural surface waters. In sediment the only major component of the residue in addition to phosmet was phthalamic acid. All these identified breakdown products were themselves relatively labile. CO2 from the carbonyl radiolabel used in the natural sediment water studies was the major sink for the applied radioactivity (accounting for 80-92% AR at 100 days). FOCUS step 2 to 4 surface water assessments have been completed for parent phosmet (with step 4 just considering spray drift mitigation) but only southern European scenarios and then only early season application timings were simulated. As the applied for representative southern European uses assessed are not restricted to applications only being made later in the growing season, if phosmet is included in annex 1, then southern member states where later season uses are applied for, should carry out national assessments of the potential for surface water exposure and associated aquatic risk assessments from the drainage and runoff routes of entry to surface water, as it is not clear that the available EU level assessment covers these situations. Also the current assessment identifies that for the early season application southern European scenarios assessed, only 1 scenario for each crop (D6 potatoes, R4 citrus and pome fruit), represented a low risk to aquatic organisms without mitigation to reduce runoff input to surface water being considered. For all other geoclimatic situations assessed high risk was identified when only the spray drift risk was mitigated.        A high acute risk to insectivorous birds was identified for all evaluated uses and also for herbivorous birds in potatoes. The initially identified high long-term risk to birds for all evaluated uses was reassessed based on measured residues in insects and grass. The refined long-term TER values for birds are above the Annex VI trigger. For a generic herbivorous mammal a potential high long-term risk was identified for all uses. The refined assessment based on selected focal mammalian species needs to be further justified.        Phosmet is very toxic to aquatic organisms. Since data on acute toxicity to seven fish species are available the safety factor was lowered from 100 to 20. Risk mitigation measures to reduce spray drift input corresponding to 40 m in orchards and 20 m in potatoes are needed in order to meet this trigger for one FOCUS scenario in each crop. Based on data from an available mesocosm study, the same buffer zones will also be sufficient to protect aquatic invertebrates in southern Europe in case of early application for one FOCUS scenario in each crop. The risk assessment for the aquatic environment needs to be complemented with scenarios for later in the season, when drainage and runoff routes of entry are likely to contribute to the concentration in surface water from the assessed uses in southern Europe. Phosmet is very toxic to bees. The high risk needs to be managed at Member State level. Application should be avoided when there are likely to be any bees in the crop and a withholding period needs to be established. The risk to non-target arthropods is high. A potential for in-field recolonisation has been demonstrated, however further data is required to address the impact off-field and the potential for recolonisation from off-field areas.        The risk to earthworms, other non-target soil macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.

rayyan-1227191443,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance ethoprophos,2006,4,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,4,4,,EFSA,,English,,,"Ethoprophos is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on ethoprophos in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 19 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 18 May 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Bayer CropScience (the original notification was made by Aventis CropScience which merged with Bayer AG in 2002 to form Bayer CropScience).. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 8 November 2004. Remaining issues, as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 7 February 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide and nematicide, as proposed by the applicant. This comprises direct overall or band/row application followed by soil incorporation to control a broad spectrum of insects and nematodes in potatoes at application rate up 11 kg ethoprophos per hectare. Ethoprophos can be used as insecticide and nematicide.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Mocap 10G"" (""AE F034142 00 FG10 A1"" or ""EXP05806A""), a granule formulation (GR), registered in the South and the North of the EU. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, i.e. ethoprophos in food of plant origin (potatoes, only) in soil, water and air.        A validated analytical method for the determination of ethoprophos in blood and animal tissues is also available.        Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Ethoprophos has a high acute toxicity and is a skin sensitizer. The proposal for classification is T+, R26/27 ""Very toxic by inhalation and in contact with skin""; T, R25 ""Toxic if swallowed""; Xi, R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"".        The most sensitive endpoint during short term exposure was cholinesterase inhibition in all species. Considering available evidence, there is no genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. The classification Xn, R48/22 ""Harmful: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed"", based on the high mortality in the first weeks of the long term rat study, is proposed. There is no evidence of reproductive toxicity, and ethoprophos was not shown to be teratogenic. Delayed neurotoxicity in acute studies with hens has not been demonstrated.        The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) 0.001 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) 0.01 mg/kg bw/day. All reference values were set using a safety factor of 100. The agreed dermal absorption value of 10% represents a worst case assumption.        The measurements of operator exposure in a field study are above the AOEL, even assuming the use of personal protective equipment and respiratory protective equipment. Only the use of Surefill containers might reduce the extent of exposure below the AOEL. Based on an air monitoring study, worker and bystander exposure are clearly below the AOEL.        The metabolism of ethoprophos in plants after soil application has been investigated in potatoes, cabbage and sweet corn. The degradation involves the hydrolysis of the S-propyl and O-ethyl ester links and further degradation to compounds later integrated in the structure of natural plant components. The major metabolite observed in plants is ethyl phosphate. This compound has no toxicological relevance. Other compounds were identified at lower levels: EPPA (O-ethyl-S-propylphosphorothioate), OME (O-ethyl-O-methyl-S-propyl-phosphorothioate) and SME (O-Ethyl-Smethyl- S-propyl-phosphorothioate). These metabolites have a level of toxicity similar to that of ethoprophos. In rotational crops metabolism data suggest a similar degradation pathway. A residue definition for risk assessment is proposed as the sum of ethoprophos, EPPA, OME and SME expressed as ethoprophos. This definition is proposed taking the available information on all crops into consideration because the data on potato tubers are not conclusive enough for a reliable residue definition for that crop. The residue definition for monitoring purposes is ethoprophos only.        Supervised residue trials on potatoes were conducted in accordance with the representative uses supported by the notifier. They lead to a proposal for a MRL of 0.02 mg/kg for potatoes, covering potatoes harvested in an early stage of their growth to be specifically marketed as small size potatoes. These trials were carried out with analysis of ethoprophos only and therefore are not appropriate to be used for risk assessment for the health of the consumer. Additional supervised residue trials in potatoes are necessary with analysis of residues according to the residue definition for risk assessment. Such studies are currently ongoing and a first set of results has already been submitted to the RMS. Before finalising acute and chronic risk assessments, further information on the nature of extractable residues in rotational crops and, depending on that information, field trials on rotational crops are also necessary.        Due to the very low exposure of livestock to residues of ethoprophos, residues in animal commodities are expected to be extremely low and do not need to be monitored and taken into consideration for assessment of the risk for the health of the consumer.        The route of degradation in soil of ethoprophos was studied under aerobic and anaerobic conditions using ethyl-or propyl-labelled compound. Ethoprophos was degraded to the minor metabolite Oethyl- S-propylphosphorothioic acid (AE 0592496) with final degradation products CO2 and unextracted residues. The route of degradation of ethoprophos under anaerobic conditions was comparable to that under aerobic conditions. The rate of degradation under laboratory conditions indicate that ethoprophos is moderately to highly persistent in soil. There is some indication (1 laboratory and two field soils) that at the low end of the soil pH range (pH 5.3 and 4.5) ethoprophos may degrade more slowly. Adsorption studies have shown that ethoprophos has very high to medium potential for mobility in soil. These data combined with groundwater modelling, indicate under European conditions there is generally a negligible risk that ethoprophos will reach ground water when applied in accordance with usual Good Agricultural Practice for potatoes, except when grown in vulnerable scenarios (i. e. FOCUS groundwater scenarios of Piacenza and Hamburg). Chemical hydrolysis and photodegradation are not considered to be relevant degradation pathways under natural environmental conditions. The metabolic pattern in water/sediment system under aerobic conditions was similar to that observed in soil. In sediment with high organic carbon content, up to 44% of ethoprophos partitioning to sediment can be observed. Estimated concentrations of ethoprophos in surface water, arising from sub surface flow, indicate that except in very vulnerable situations, there is no cause for concern. Concentrations of ethoprophos in the air compartment will be negligible, due to the method of application (soil incorporation) and short persistence in the atmosphere. There were no major metabolites identified in any of the fate and behaviour studies.        The consumption of contaminated soil organisms (earthworms) and systemic residues in volunteer plants growing in potato fields were assumed as the main routes of exposure for birds and mammals. Uptake of granules as grit was identified to be a main route of exposure for birds. The acute risk, short-term risk and long term-risk to small granivorous birds from intentional uptake of granules is high. Further risk refinement steps and risk mitigation measures to ensure high incorporation efficiency are required. The refined acute risk assessment for herbivorous birds is low but needs Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, i. e. ethoprophos in food of plant origin (potatoes, only) in soil, water and air.        A validated analytical method for the determination of ethoprophos in blood and animal tissues is also available.        Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Ethoprophos has a high acute toxicity and is a skin sensitizer. The proposal for classification is T+, R26/27 ""Very toxic by inhalation and in contact with skin""; T, R25 ""Toxic if swallowed""; Xi, R43 "" May cause sensitisation by skin contact"".        The most sensitive endpoint during short term exposure was cholinesterase inhibition in all species. Considering available evidence, there is no genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. The classification Xn, R48/22 ""Harmful: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed"", based on the high mortality in the first weeks of the long term rat study, is proposed. There is no evidence of reproductive toxicity, and ethoprophos was not shown to be teratogenic. Delayed neurotoxicity in acute studies with hens has not been demonstrated.        The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) 0.001 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) 0.01 mg/kg bw/day. All reference values were set using a safety factor of 100. The agreed dermal absorption value of 10% represents a worst case assumption.        The measurements of operator exposure in a field study are above the AOEL, even assuming the use of personal protective equipment and respiratory protective equipment. Only the use of Surefill containers might reduce the extent of exposure below the AOEL. Based on an air monitoring study, worker and bystander exposure are clearly below the AOEL.        The metabolism of ethoprophos in plants after soil application has been investigated in potatoes, cabbage and sweet corn. The degradation involves the hydrolysis of the S-propyl and 0-ethyl ester links and further degradation to compounds later integrated in the structure of natural plant components. The major metabolite observed in plants is ethyl phosphate. This compound has no toxicological relevance. Other compounds were identified at lower levels: EPPA (O-ethyl-S-propylphosphorothioate), OME (O-ethyl-O-methyl-S-propyl-phosphorothioate) and SME (O-Ethyl-Smethyl- S-propyl-phosphorothioate). These metabolites have a level of toxicity similar to that of ethoprophos. In rotational crops metabolism data suggest a similar degradation pathway. A residue definition for risk assessment is proposed as the sum of ethoprophos, EPPA, OME and SME expressed as ethoprophos. This definition is proposed taking the available information on all crops into consideration because the data on potato tubers are not conclusive enough for a reliable residue definition for that crop. The residue definition for monitoring purposes is ethoprophos only.        Supervised residue trials on potatoes were conducted in accordance with the representative uses supported by the notifier. They lead to a proposal for a MRL of 0.02 mg/kg for potatoes, covering potatoes harvested in an early stage of their growth to be specifically marketed as small size potatoes. These trials were carried out with analysis of ethoprophos only and therefore are not appropriate to be used for risk assessment for the health of the consumer. Additional supervised residue trials in potatoes are necessary with analysis of residues according to the residue definition for risk assessment. Such studies are currently ongoing and a first set of results has already been submitted to the RMS. Before finalising acute and chronic risk assessments, further information on the nature of extractable residues in rotational crops and, depending on that information, field trials on rotational crops are also necessary.        Due to the very low exposure of livestock to residues of ethoprophos, residues in animal commodities are expected to be extremely low and do not need to be monitored and taken into consideration for assessment of the risk for the health of the consumer.

The acute risk, short-term risk and long term-risk to small granivorous birds from intentional uptake of granules is high. Further risk refinement steps and risk mitigation measures to ensure high incorporation efficiency are required. The refined acute risk assessment for herbivorous birds is low but needs further support by data. The short term risk and the long-term risk to herbivorous birds were considered to be low. A high acute, short-term and long-term risk to earthworm eating birds was indicated and further data are required to support the suggested risk refinement steps. The acute and long-term risk to herbivorous mammals such as the hare was assessed as low. The long-term risk to earthworm eating mammals is high. Further risk refinement steps are required. The chronic risk to aquatic invertebrates and the potential risk of bioaccumulation is high under vulnerable conditions where contamination of surface water arises. The study with Chironomus riparius needs to be evaluated in order to draw a final conclusion on the risk to sediment dwelling organisms. A potential risk of bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms was identified if contamination of aquatic habitats arises. For conditions where contamination of surface water arises the risk of biomagnification in aquatic food chains and the risk of secondary poisoning of fish eating birds and mammals needs to be addressed. Severe acute and sublethal effects were observed in tests with non-target arthropods and a high risk was indicated. The higher tier risk assessment for non-target arthropods was discussed in the EPCO expert meeting. It was concluded that the potential of recovery was sufficiently demonstrated taking into account that the field margins remain unaffected and thus providing a reservoir for recolonisation. A high acute and long-term risk was indicated for earthworms in the first tier risk assessment. In a field study severe acute effects were observed. However the effects full recovery was observed within 5 months after the application and it is concluded that the risk to earthworms is sufficiently addressed. The risk to bees, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target flora and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.

rayyan-1227191444,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fenitrothion finalised: 13 January 2006,2006,2,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,4,2,,EFSA,,English,,,"Fenitrothion is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fenitrothion in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 4 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 24 November 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Sumitomo Chemical Agro Europe S.A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in July 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January - March 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 28 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying in tomato and grapevine at application rates up to 750 g per hectare. Fenitrothion can be used only as insecticide.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""IPM 400"", a capsule suspension concentrate (CS), registered under different trade names in southern Member States of the EU.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of fenitrothion.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Fenitrothion (FNT) is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. It is mainly distributed to the liver, blood and carcass. Elimination is very rapid. The main metabolites are the phosphate fenitrothion (FNO), the mono methyl analogues of FNT and FNO (DM-FNT and DM-FNO respectively) and 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol (NMC) and its corresponding sulphate and glucuronide.        The oral LD50 is 330-1700 mg/kg bw.The dermal LD50 is 890 mg/kg bw, therefore the classification R21 (Harmful in contact with the skin), is proposed. FNT acute inhalatory toxicity is low. FNT is not a skin or an eye irritant in rabbits, but it is a skin sensitiser. Therefore, the classification R43 (May cause sensitisation in contact with the skin), is proposed.        The critical effect is decreased erythrocyte and brain cholinesterase. The relevant short term toxicity NOAEL is 1.32 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day study in rats. No evidence of delayed neurotoxicity was found in hens following acute and subacute exposures.        The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.005 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) are 0.013 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor (SF) of 100. The estimated operator exposure in grapes exceeds the AOEL, as well as re-entry exposure estimates for workers not wearing PPE. In outdoor tomatoes: the estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL only for field crop spraying with the use of PPE; re-entry exposure estimates for workers not wearing PPE exceed the AOEL. A biomonitoring study in greenhouse tomatoes not fully representative of the intended uses showed exposure below the AOEL (maximum 25%). The exposure to harvesters without PPE would be acceptable. Exposure estimates for general re-entry activities exceed the AOEL for workers not wearing PPE.        Metabolism studies of fenitrothion in tomatoes and grapes indicate that the major metabolic pathway proceeds through the hydrolysis of the compound leading to 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol and dimethylphosphorothioic acid. 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol is further conjugated and has no anticholinesterase activity. Due to the labelling position, the fate of dimethylphosphorothioic acid was not further investigated. Another minor pathway consists in O-demethylation of fenitrothion leading to desmethylfenitrothion. The proposed residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment is fenitrothion only. However the possible contribution of desmethylfenitrothion and dimethylphosphorothioic acid to the toxicological burden is not known and should be investigated before the residue definition for risk assessment can be finalised.        Sufficient supervised residue trials were submitted in accordance with the representative uses and supporting the establishment of MRLs at 3 and 0.1 mg/kg in grapes (table and wine grapes) and tomatoes respectively. The behaviour of residues through processing was investigated and it was shown that fenitrothion is degraded into desmethylfenitrothion under hydrolysis conditions. Low transfer factors of fenitrothion were calculated for the processing to grape juice, wine, tomato puree and tomato juice.        Metabolism studies in livestock were submitted although not required as the representative uses do not imply animal exposure to residues of fenitrothion through feedingstuffs. These studies were not sufficient to build a complete picture of the nature of the residues to be expected in all animal commodities.        Acute and chronic risk assessments have been carried out taking into account fenitrothion residues only. These assessments have demonstrated a potential for acute risk for the consumer resulting from the consumption of treated table grapes. For the other commodities, although the exposure to fenitrothion residues is below the trigger toxicological values, a robust conclusion is not possible at this stage, given the lack of information on the toxicological relevance and the actual levels in commodities of desmethylfenitrothion and dimethylphosphorothioic acid.        In soil under dark aerobic conditions fenitrothion yields the major metabolite NMC. Substantial formation of unextractable residues and mineralization was observed. Under dark anaerobic conditions AM-FNT and AA-FNT were found to be the major metabolites.        Photolysis in soil is unlikely to contribute to the environmental degradation of fenitrothion.        Fenitrothion is low persistent in soil under aerobic conditions when applied directly or formulated as and emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Half life is significantly longer for the encapsulated formulation proposed for the representative uses (CS: DT (50 lab CS) = 82.3 d). Additional laboratory and field dissipation studies with the CS formulation were required and have been presented but have not been evaluated by the RMS. The experts' meeting agreed to propose a restriction to use only in green houses until the data requirements for the CS formulation are fulfilled.        The major metabolite NMC is low persistent in soil under aerobic conditions (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 2.8 -3.3 d).        PECs in soil presented in the DAR can not be regarded as worst case. Therefore, risk assessment for the EU representative uses may not be considered concluded and reassessment will be necessary once the data requirement for further soil studies with the CS formulation is fulfilled.        Fenitrothion is medium mobile (K-oc = 252- 384 mL / g) and NMC is medium mobile (K-foc = 270-303 mL / g) in soil. Fenitrothion shows a slow hydrolytic degradation. The release rate of the CS formulation was investigated in sterile aqueous buffer solutions. It is reasonable to expect that the further soil studies already required for the CS formulation will provide additional information on the release rate of fenitrothion in soil.        Photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of fenitrothion in water. However, this contribution is deemed to be low for the fenitrothion applied as an encapsulated formulation. Fenitrothion is not readily biodegradable in water.        In water-sediment systems fenitrothion (pure active substance) dissipated rapidly from the water phase. NMC, AM-FNT, Unk 2 (tentatively identified as DM-AM-FNT), Unk 6 (tentatively identified as A-NMC and considered an analytical artefact of NMC) were the major metabolites in the water phase. In the sediment phase only NMC was measured at levels above 10 % of AR. All metabolites declined to very low levels until the end of the study. Most of the applied radioactivity accumulated in the NER fraction of the sediment that undergoes slow further mineralization with CO2 release. An aerobic water-sediment study compares the degradation of fenitrothion applied as the CS formulation with an EC formulation. When applied as CS formulation the capsules tend to settle in the sediment phase. The DT50 for the CS formulated fenitrothion was beyond the duration of the study and estimated to be 84 97 days for the whole system.        The PECSW and PECSED were calculated for the field uses with spray drift as the only entry route into surface water. PECSW values were also provided for the metabolites AM-FNT, DM-AM-FNT and NMC. These PECSW/SED may need to be revised on basis of new information on the release rate. The applicant submitted PECSW / PECSED calculation for the use in glasshouses based on the Netherlands scheme. However, this calculation was not evaluated by the RMS which proposed a non exposure situation for this use. Experts' meeting concluded that potential surface water contamination arising from glasshouse representative use needs to be assessed taking also into account the high potential risk to aquatic organisms and the potential for volatilization (see chapter 5.2.). However, the difficulties to perform this risk assessment at this stage, due to the lack of EU agreed procedure, were recognized by the meeting.        On basis of the FOCUS ground water calculations, concentrations of fenitrothion and the metabolite NMC were not expected to exceed 0.1 mu g / L in ground water, irrespective to the release rate from the capsules (DT50 release = 0 - 250 d were simulated).        According the Henry Law constant there is some potential for volatilization of fenitrothion. The use as a microencapsulated formulation will reduce this potential for volatilization. Furthermore, half life in air was calculated to be 6 h indicating that long range transport is not likely.        The acute, short-term and the long-term risk to birds and the long term risk to mammals from uptake of contaminated food items was assessed as high from the representative outdoor uses (tomato and grapevine). Consequently further risk refinement steps are necessary to address the risk to birds and mammals. A high long term risk to birds and mammals was identified from the uptake of contaminated earthworms. The applicant submitted new information on the risk to birds and mammals from fenitrothion residues in earthworms and further information to address the risk of secondary poisoning from consumption of contaminated fish and a statement on the risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water. This new information was not evaluated by the RMS.        Daphnia magna was the most sensitive tested aquatic species. A high acute and chronic risk from the representative outdoor uses was identified. The relevant acute Annex VI TER trigger values are exceeded only if buffer zones of 200 m (tomato) and 175 m (grapevine) are taken into account. However, even with buffer zones as large as 250 m the chronic TER values are still below the Annex VI trigger value of 10. The applicant submitted a risk assessment based on the Netherlands scheme for calculating emissions from greenhouses. This risk assessment was not evaluated by the RMS. Instead a no exposure situation was proposed. The Experts' meeting agreed that PECsw water calculations for the greenhouse use are needed. A final conclusion on the risk to aquatic organisms from the representative use in greenhouses cannot be drawn. However, taking into account the very high toxicity to daphnids, a high risk to aquatic organisms from the greenhouse use cannot be excluded if exposure of aquatic organisms from greenhouse use is possible. The acute risk of the major metabolites in the water-sediment system, NMC and AM-FNT were assessed as low. Testing with the metabolite DM-AM-FNT was considered as not necessary because it is very unstable and the precursor AM-FNT is three orders of magnitude less toxic than fenitrothion. A mesocosm study was submitted by the applicant prior to the Experts' meeting to refine the risk to aquatic invertebrates. The mesocosm study was not evaluated by the RMS because it was considered as not relevant by the RMS for the greenhouse use.        A high risk to bees was shown from oral and contact exposure to fenitrothion (technical) and for contact toxicity of the formulation IPM 400 CS. Higher tier studies with bees were available. However, the studies were conducted for other uses than the representative uses. It was not clear whether the available studies address the risk from the representative uses in tomato and grapevine. Therefore a high risk to bees from the representative outdoor uses cannot be excluded. Risk mitigation measures like labelling were suggested by the RMS. It was agreed at the EPCO Experts` meeting that risk mitigation measures for pollinating insects have to be set at MS level for the representative use in greenhouses.        Higher tier tests were conducted to address the risk to non-target arthropods. Freshly dried residues of an application of IPM 400 at a dose rate similar to the GAP led to significant mortality in the tested non-target arthropods. Aphidius rhopalosiphi was the most sensitive species. No significant effects on mortality or fecundity of A. rhopalosiphi were observed in tests with 42 d aged residues showing the potential of recolonisation. An elaborated risk assessment for the off-field risk from the representative outdoor uses (tomato and grapevine) to non-target arthropods is considered necessary. A final conclusion on the risk to non-target arthropods from the outdoor use can be drawn when the off-field risk assessment is made available. Because of the high toxicity to non-target arthropods the meeting proposed a labelling for the greenhouse use to protect species which are used for biological pest control.        The acute risk to earthworms was assessed to be low but the long-term risk to earthworms was assessed as high. Further information to address the long-term risk to earthworms was submitted by the applicant in September 2004 but not evaluated by the RMS. The chronic risk from the soil metabolite NMC posed to earthworms is considered to be low.        No information was available on the toxicity of fenitrothion to other soil non-target organisms. Fenitrothion is formulated as a slow release micro-capsule and the DT90lab for the formulation was estimated to be 283 days. A high long term risk was observed for earthworms and for non-target arthropods in the higher tier studies. Therefore a data requirement was set by the RMS to address the risk to other soil non-target macro-organisms. Further information to address the risk to soil non-target macro-organisms was submitted by the applicant in September 2004 but was not evaluated by the RMS. The risk from fenitrothion from the representative uses to soil non-target micro-organisms was assessed to be low. Further information submitted by the applicant to address the risk of the soil metabolite NMC was not evaluated by the RMS. Therefore a final conclusion on the risk of the soil metabolite NMC to soil non-target micro-organisms cannot be drawn.        The risk of fenitrothion to other non-target organisms (flora) and biological methods of biological sewage treatment is considered to be low.        Further data/information to address the risk from the outdoor uses to birds and mammals, aquatic organisms, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms was submitted prior to the EPCO Experts' meeting. This data/information was not evaluated by the RMS and no further risk assessment was conducted. As far as the risk from the representative outdoor uses was assessed (not taking into account the new information/data and further risk refinement steps) it is preliminary concluded that the outdoor uses pose a high risk to birds and mammals, aquatic organisms, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro-organisms and soil-non target micro-organisms. The risk from the greenhouse use (provided it is a permanent construction and no natural soil is used) posed to birds and mammals, earthworms, soil non-target macro-organisms and soil non-target micro-organisms is considered to be low. Risk mitigation measures are suggested for the greenhouse use for pollinating insects, non-target arthropods (species used in biological pest control). A risk assessment for aquatic organisms should be conducted for the representative use in greenhouses at Member State level.

Austria being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on pyrimethanil in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 15 April 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 18 May 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 8 November 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 28 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar spraying to control Botrytis cinerea in grape (wine), Venturia inaequalis in apples and Botrytis spp. in protein peas, respectively. The application rates are up to 1 kg pyrimethanil per hectare in grape (wine)(3) and up to 600 g per hectare in apples and protein peas. Pyrimethanil can be used only as fungicide.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Scala"" (""CQ 1294"", ""EXP 10588A""), a suspension concentrate (SC), registered in most of the EU Member States.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of pyrimethanil.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Pyrimethanil is rapidly orally absorbed (70 - 80 %), and also quickly excreted. There is no potential for bioaccumulation. The metabolic degradation of pyrimethanil in rats occurs primarily via oxidation on one or both rings of the molecule and subsequent conjugation. Pyrimethanil has a low acute toxicity and is not a skin or eye irritant, nor a skin sensitizer. In short term toxicity studies in rats and mice, main target organs were liver (increased weight, histopathological changes) and thyroid (histopathological changes). In dogs, a dose-related marked decrease in water intake was observed. The relevant oral no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for short term toxicity is 5.4 mg/kg bw/day (90-days rat study). There is no evidence from the available studies of a mutagenic, genotoxic or carcinogenic potential of pyrimethanil. The relevant oral NOAEL for long term toxicity is 17.3 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study. Pyrimethanil did not show any adverse effects on reproduction parameters. Pyrimethanil is not teratogenic. No signs of neurotoxicity were observed in any test. Supplementary studies were conducted with the soil metabolite AE F132593. The metabolite was of moderate acute oral toxicity and was found of no genotoxic potential and it can be considered of no toxicological relevance. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that enhanced hepatic metabolism induced by pyrimethanil resulted in an increased thyroid hormone clearance resulting in a chronic stimulation of the thyroid.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.17 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL from the 2-year rat study with a safety factor of 100; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.12 mg/kg bw/day based on the overall NOAEL of 17.4 mg/kg bw/day from the collective results of the 90-day and the 104 week rat study. An additional correction factor was applied due to the limited enteral absorption rate of approx. 72%. From the evaluation of the available toxicological data base of pyrimethanil it was concluded that there is no need to establish an acute reference dos (ARfD). Based on the results of an in vitro study with human skin samples performed with a SC-formulation, a dermal absorption rate of pyrimethanil of 1% for the concentrate and 20% for the spray dilution was proposed for human risk assessment.        According to UK POEM model as well as German BBA model the estimated operator exposure for most of the intended uses is below the AOEL only when appropriate PPE (gloves, coverall) is considered. The estimated worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL.        The metabolism of pyrimethanil has been investigated in a large range of crops and it was shown that the parent compound is forming the major part of the residue even for PHI as long as 42 days. The metabolites identified do not cause any concern due to their nature and their amount. The residue definition in plant commodities can be limited to pyrimethanil for both monitoring and risk assessment. The supervised residue trials submitted are sufficient to propose the setting of MRLs at 1 and 3 mg/kg for apples and wine grapes respectively. Pyrimethanil is not degraded under processing conditions. The transfer factors to wine, apple juice and puree are below 1, indicating that the compound is preferably transferred to the non food processed fractions. Under field conditions the presence of residues of pyrimethanil and its metabolites in rotational crops is limited to low amounts below 0.05 mg/kg and do not represent a significant toxicological burden.        In cattle pyrimethanil is extensively metabolised and 2 metabolites were identified as major (2-(4-hydroxyanilino)-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine and 2-anilino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-5-ol), but their presence at measurable levels under practical condition, taking into account the exposure of livestock through apple pomace and protein peas, can be excluded. Therefore no residue definition for animal commodities is needed.        No dietary risk was identified due to residues resulting from the use of pyrimethanil according to the representative uses in apples, wine grapes and protein peas supported by the manufacturer.        Pyrimethanil is moderate to medium persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions. The major transformation product was 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine. This metabolite is moderate to high persistent in soil. Mineralization after 90 -100 d was in the range of 4 - 7 % AR and the bounded residues reached levels between 42 - 62 % AR. The half lives used on the FOCUS ground water modelling were derived from a separated kinetic multicompartmental analysis with TopFit 2.0. Degradation is much slower under anaerobic conditions (DT50 > 300 d). Dissipation in field trials in Germany confirms that pyrimethanil is a moderate persistent substance in soil (DT50 field = 23 54 d).        PEC soil were calculated for the representative uses based on worst case field half life (DT50 = 54 d). As metabolite 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine was not detected in field studies the PECmax in soil was estimated from the LOD (LOD <= 0.02 mg/kg).        Pyrimethanil is low to high mobile in soil (K-oc = 75 751 mL / g) and 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine is medium to high mobile in soil (K-oc = 56 240 mL / g).        A three years lysimeter study in Germany on two lysimeters with vines is available. No pyrimethanil was found in both lysimeters at any sampling date. Most of the radioactivity in the leachate was found as not extractable from the water phase.        Pyrimethanil is hydrolytically stable in sterile buffer solutions at environmental relevant pH and temperature. Direct photolysis does not contribute to the environmental degradation of pyrimethanil in water. Pyrimethanil is not ready biodegradable.        Degradation of pyrimethanil in dark aerobic water environment at 20 degrees C was investigated in two water sediment systems. Dissipation of pyrimethanil from the water phase took place with half lives of 8.9 and 24 d, mainly due to adsorption to the sediment. Degradation in the whole system proceeds slowly (DT50 whole system = 40 121 d or DT50 whole system = 29 114 d with TopFit multicompartmental kinetic evaluation) with the formation of 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine (max 10.4 % AR after 100 d in the whole system) and the formation of non extractable sediment residues (max 27.3 47.7 % AR). Mineralization was low to moderate (CO2 = 2.4 9.1 % AR).        PECSW and PECSED were calculated using the Top Fit derived kinetic constants assuming the application pattern proposed in the table of GAP for the representative uses but only including the spray drift route of entry to surface water. Worst case parameters were selected in the calculation. Peak concentration reached after repeated applications were taken as initial PECSW / PECSED for the risk assessment. Member States should assess the potential for soil residues to reach surface water as a result of the drainage and runoff.        Potential for ground water contamination was assessed for pyrimethanil and metabolite 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine based on FOCUS PELMO 1.1.1. The trigger of 0.1 mu g/L was not exceeded for any of the nine scenarios neither by pyrimethanil nor by the metabolite 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine.        Significant volatilization from leave surface (27 %) and soil surface (10 %) was observed in the study provided. However, the potential for photochemical degradation of pyrimethanil in air is high (DT50 air Atkinson = 1.8 h), indicating very low potential for long transport in air.        The acute and short term risk to birds can be regarded as low for all the representative uses evaluated. Also the long term risk to birds for the representative uses in apples and protein peas and the long term risk to large herbivorous birds in grapes can be regarded as low. The long term risk to insectivorous birds in grapes is high in the first tier risk assessment but based on a weight of evidence approach the EPCO experts' meeting considered the long term risk to insectivorous birds in grapes addressed. The acute risk to mammals is considered to be low but a potential high long term risk to mammals was identified in the first tier risk assessment for all representative uses evaluated. After refinement of these assessments, the long term risk to mammals can be regarded as low for all representative uses evaluated. The EPCO experts' meeting agreed to refine the long term risk to mammals for the use in apples for Annex I inclusion based on the diet composition data for voles as no such data for the most appropriate focal species wood mouse was available. Particular attention should be paid at MS level on the choice of focal species to refine the long term risk to mammals in orchards.        The risk to aquatic organisms is driven by the chronic risk to fish. The EPCO experts' meeting did not accept the available fish ELS study and set a data gap for a new fish ELS study and in addition considered an argumentation for the use of the PECtwa-value necessary. Based on the next most pivotal endpoint the risk to aquatic organisms for the representative use in protein peas and vines can be considered as low without the need for risk mitigation measures. For the representative uses in apple orchards the risk can be regarded as low if risk mitigation measures such as a 10 meter buffer zone are taken into account. The EFSA would like to point out that the risk to aquatic organisms can only be concluded once the new fish ELS study becomes available and that most likely more risk mitigation measures will be needed once this study becomes available.        The risk for bioconcentration in fish from the metabolite AE F132593 cannot be concluded as the LogPow is not known. Therefore the EFSA proposes a data requirement for the notifier to make the LogPow of AE F132593 available.        The risk to bees and non-target arthropods can be regarded as low.        The acute risk to earthworms can be regarded as low. Also the long term risk to earthworms for the uses in protein peas and grapes can be regarded as low but a high long term risk to earthworms from the use in apple orchards was identified. The refinement of this risk was not accepted by the EPCO expert's meeting and therefore the meeting set a further data gap for an additional long term toxicity study to earthworms with the lead formulation Scala with more doses and lower organic material. Furthermore a long term study on earthworms with the soil metabolite 2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine is requested. No adverse effects on organic matter breakdown are expected from pyrimethanil from the representative uses evaluated.        The risk to soil non-target micro-organisms from the lead formulation Scala is considered to be low, but a study on soil micro-organisms with the metabolite 2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine is still required.        The risk from pyrimethanil on non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is considered to be low for all representative uses evaluated.

rayyan-1227191448,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance trifluralin,2005,4,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,3,4,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Trifluralin is one of the 52 substances of the second stage covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on trifluralin in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 11 July 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 24 July 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifier, the European Union Trifluralin Taskforce comprising of Agan Chemical Manufacturers Ltd. and Dintec Agroquimica Produtos Quimicos Lda. at the time of finalisation of the conclusion. Subsequently, the comments received were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 15 January 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April, May and June 2004.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from Member States on 10 February 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises spraying to bare soil to control grass and broad-leaved weeds in oilseed rape, sunflowers, cotton and winter cereals at application rate up 1.2 kg trifluralin per hectare. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""EF-1521"" (""Treflan""), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Europe. In case of oilseed rape, sunflowers, cotton, incorporation into soil takes place after the application. Trifluralin can be Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition.        Trifluralin is extensively and rapidly metabolised and absorbed. It has a low acute toxicity, but has sensitising properties (proposed classification: R43). Trifluralin induced neoplastic changes and carcinogenic effects were seen in rats such as Leydig cell tumours, thyroid tumours and renal carcinoma (proposed classification: R40). A no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) could not be established but the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 30 mg/kg bw/day in the rat was assigned as the most relevant effect level. There were no direct effects on reproductive performance or fertility.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the LOAEL in the rat carcinogenicity study with a margin of safety between LOAEL and ADI of 2000. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.026 mg/kg bw/day and no acute reference dose (ARfD) was allocated. The estimated operator exposure was below the AOEL only if personal protective equipment (PPE) is worn both during mixing/loading and during application.        The metabolism of trifluralin in cereals is extensive and does not yield metabolites of toxicological concern. No residues of trifluralin were quantified in any of the cereal grain or straw samples from field trials conducted according the critical good agricultural practise (GAP) in Northern Europe. Further information is needed to conclude on the residue situation in cereals for Southern European uses.        For oilseed crops the present studies do not fully address consumer exposure via seeds. Therefore a further metabolism study is required for oilseeds to support uses on these crops. Subsequently the applicability of the submitted residue trials in oilseed crops has to be reviewed. Due to the above mentioned requirements a final conclusion on the livestock dietary burden and on the possibly occurrence of residues in food of animal origin cannot be drawn at this stage. The chronic dietary exposure assessment for consumers based on the currently available information in line with the Northern European GAP on cereals leads to estimated intakes less than 4% of the proposed ADI for the consumer subgroups of infants and young children. However, this assessment needs to be reviewed upon receipt of the outstanding data. An ARfD was not allocated, thus there is no acute risk for consumers arising from trifluralin residues in food.        In aerobic conditions degradation of trifluralin in soil did not lead to any major metabolite. Under flooded anaerobic conditions a major metabolite TR-43 is formed. Furthermore, metabolite TR-144 was formed at amounts above 5 % at the end of the study in all three anaerobic soils tested. Due to its potential degradation under aerobic conditions, TR-4 may be addressed by Member States where anaerobic conditions are envisaged to be relevant. Whereas not discussed in particular during the Peer Review, it is EFSA's opinion that the same conclusion may be reached for metabolite TR-14.        Under aerobic laboratory conditions trifluralin is medium to highly persistent with half-lives between 81 to 356 d at 22 degrees C. The degradation under anaerobic conditions was faster than under aerobic conditions. Data indicate that trifluralin is strongly adsorbed to soil and could be classified as immobile. Trifluralin is hydrolytically stable under environmental relevant conditions. Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of trifluralin producing TR-65 and TR-156 metabolites. Trifluralin is not readily biodegradable. During the Peer Review, it was agreed that worst case DT50 = 13 d should be employed for the risk assessment performed in the context of Annex I inclusion and that a DT50 = 2 d could be used to refine risk assessment when appropriate. Due to the potential contribution of photolysis to the dissipation of trifluralin in water, the fate and behaviour in the environment expert meeting confirmed the need of a water sediment study conducted in the presence of light that could be used by MS to refine the risk assessment performed in the context of Annex I inclusion. Neither trifluralin nor its anaerobic metabolite TR-4 are expected to contaminate ground water at levels above 0.1 mu g / L under the proposed conditions of use.        Trifluralin was designated as a ""priority substance"" under the Water Framework Directive7 but has not been identified as a ""priority hazardous substance"". However, trifluralin has been added to the OSPAR (Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) List of Chemicals for Priority action in 2002 because it is considered to be a PBT substance fulfilling the criteria for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity.        Because of its high volatility the occurrence of trifluralin in air and transport trough air is possible. However, photochemical half life in air is estimated to be short.        The risk to insectivorous and fish-eating birds and mammals, bees, ground dwelling arthropods, soil micro-organisms, including earthworms is low with respect to trifluralin and the metabolites as far as investigated. High risks were identified for aquatic organisms, in particular the chronic risk to fish, which require consideration of appropriate risk mitigation measures. Using the initial predicted environmental concentrations (PEC's) together with the no observed effect level (NOEC) of 0.3 mu g/L leads to a toxicity exposure ratio (TER)-value of 0.38 when a bufferzone of 15 metres is taken into account which is below the Annex VI trigger value of 10 (without detailed calculations, a bufferzone of 50 m should lead to a TER-value of approximately 1). Further data to address this risk is needed and the risk assessment can only be concluded when the outstanding data is evaluated.        The EPCO expert meeting (section ecotoxicology, June 2004) considered the risk to earthworm eating birds and mammals as low, based on the TER value reflecting the soil accumulation plateau. EFSA would like to highlight that the risk to earthworm eating birds and mammals should be considered further at MS-level when the product is applied after this plateau value is reached. EFSA proposes that a new litterbag study should be made available in which the tested dose rate reflects the concentration in the soil after a single application when the accumulation plateau has been reached as the study which is available at present was performed at a lower dose rate. This data requirement has not been discussed in an EPCO expert meeting        The risk to non-target plants could not be calculated with the appropriate endpoint (median emergence rate (ER50) value) as this value is not reported in the DAR. Based on a conservative no observed effect concentration (NOEC), the risk to non-target plants can be certainly regarded as low if a bufferzone of 5 metres is taken into account.        Regulation (EC) No 850/20048 of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC9 entered into force when the Peer Review of trifluralin was in an advanced stage. For this reason, EFSA's conclusion does not specifically assess trifluralin against the criteria set in the paragraph 1 of Annex D of the Stockholm Convention(10). However, available information assessed during the Peer Review and provided in this conclusion should allow the Commission and the Member States to conduct the assessment of trifluralin with respect to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004. As this conclusion only considers a limited range of representative uses, other information may need to be considered by the Commission and the Member States when assessing trifluralin with respect to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004.

rayyan-1227191449,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance tolylfluanid,2005,4,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,3,4,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Tolylfluanid is one of the 52 substances of the second stage covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tolylfluanid in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 13 June 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 30 July 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Bayer AG. Subsequently, the comments received were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 12 March 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2004.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from Member States on 9 February 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a foliar fungicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprises spray treatment to foliar to control a wide range of fungicidal diseases such as apple scab, grey mould, leaf spot diseases and powdery and downy mildew in different fruits, vegetables and hops at application rate up 3 kg tolylfluanid per hectare. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "" Euparen M WG 50"", a water dispersible granule (WG), registered in almost all Member States of the EU.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition apart from food of animal origin.        Tolylfluanid is extensively and rapidly absorbed (> 90%). Oral and dermal toxicity is low. However, toxicity during inhalation exposure was low to high which was related to the particle size leading to a differentiated proposal for classification i.e. tolylfluanid containing >= 0.1% particles < 50 mu m (T+; R26). Tolylfluanid has irritating properties in both eyes and skin (proposed classification: Xi; R36/37/38) and has sensitizing properties (proposed classification: R43). Main effects during short term oral exposure were functional disturbance of the thyroid, increased liver weights and decreased liver enzyme levels in the rat and dog and slight histopathological changes in the kidney in the dog at high dose levels. During inhalation exposure severe respiratory tract irritation including deaths was observed. Depending on the particle size, tolylfluanid containing >= 0.1% particles < 50 mu m is classified as toxic (proposed classification: T, R48/R23). Tolylfluanid is neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic. There were no effects on reproductive or developmental toxicity observed and no evidence of neurotoxicity was observed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is set to 0.1 mg/kg, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) to 0.3 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) to 0.25 mg/kg bw/day. The estimated operator, worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL for proposed uses of Euparen M 50 WG.        The metabolism of tolylfluanid in plants proceeds through degradation to DMST3, being the main metabolite in the majority of investigated crops. Moreover, under processing conditions tolylfluanid degrades rapidly and almost completely to DMST, that has a similar toxicity compared to tolylfluanid. The residue situation in food of plant origin was proved with a sufficient number of trials according to the critical GAP for a wide range of fruit and vegetable crops and for hops; and also with studies determining the level of residues in processed products.        In livestock tolylfluanid is rapidly metabolised to DMST that was detected in all organs and tissues as well as in eggs. Assuming fruit pomace as the only relevant feed item possibly containing residues from tolylfluanid treatment, no quantifiable residues are expected in edible products of animal origin. The chronic and acute dietary exposure assessment for adult consumers indicates that the intake of residues via the total diet for food of plant origin or any individual food item considered does not exceed the ADI and the ARfD, respectively.        For toddlers and children the theoretical maximum daily residue intake from fruit and vegetables (TMDI) occupies no more than 70% of the ADI, indicating that long-term exposure to residues from tolylfluanid treated crops does not pose an adverse health risk to these consumer subgroups. The estimation of the short term exposure revealed that the ARfD is slightly exceeded (102%, WHO/GEMS Food data) for children consuming table grapes. However, Germany pointed out during the last discussion of tolylfluanid that a greater exceedance of the ARfD (121%) was obtained based on national consumption data for children.        Under aerobic conditions, tolylfluanid yields DMST that is subsequently degraded to other minor metabolites (none > 10 % AR) and ultimately bound residue and CO2. Photolysis will not significantly contribute to the overall degradation of tolylfluanid under environmental conditions. Tolylfluanid is between very low to low persistent in soil and metabolite DMST is low persistent. Tolylfluanid should be classified as a slightly to low mobile compound and DMST can be classified as a medium to high mobile compound.        Hydrolysis of tolylfluanid is rapid and slightly pH dependent. DMST is stable in all range of environmental relevant pH. Direct photodegradation is not expected to contribute to the degradation of tolylfluanid or its metabolite DMST in the aqueous environment. Tolylfluanid is not ready biodegradable. In water sediment systems, tolylfluanid completely disappear from water phase in about three days mainly due to degradation. Levels of tolylfluanid found in the sediment never attained the 10 % of AR. Major metabolite, both in water and sediment, was DMST. DMST dissipates from the water phase by degradation and adsorption to the sediment. On the basis of FOCUS-PELMO model simulations neither tolylfluanid nor DMST are expected to exceed the 0.1 mu g /L trigger in ground water.        The risk to birds, bees, soil micro-and macro-organisms, including earthworms and non-target terrestrial plants is low with respect to tolylfluanid and the metabolites as far as investigated. A high long term risk to mammals was identified. The toxicity exposure ratio (TER) values range from 0.84 to 2.78 depending on the representative use evaluated and therefore breaching the Annex VI trigger value of 5 for all the representative uses evaluated. Further data to address this risk is needed and the risk assessment can only be concluded when the outstanding data is evaluated. High risk is identified for fish (being the most sensitive aquatic organism), which requires consideration of appropriate risk mitigation measures. Pending on the representative use, bufferzones of 5-20 metres are needed to respect the Annex VI trigger value. The toxicity to fish is higher at lower pH-values therefore it is proposed that Member States with surface water bodies of low pH (< 6) associated with agricultural landscapes should consider the effect of pH on toxicity to fish at the local level.        Also for non-target arthropods (other than bees) a high risk was identified in-field however a recovery before the start of next season is considered possible.

Two specific carbamates used in agriculture are ziram and maneb; ziram also is used as an additive in rubber products including latex gloves. In previous studies we demonstrated that at concentrations in the 150-200 nM range, the OTs tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT) were capable of disrupting the function of human NK cells after incubations to as short as 24 h. Previously, we also examined the effects of ziram and maneb at higher concentrations on the cytotoxic function of human NK cells. The current study examined the effects of exposure of up to 6 days to lower concentrations of each of these compounds on the cytotoxic function of NK cells. The OTs were studied at concentrations ranging from 200 to 10 nM; ziram was studied at concentrations of 2.5 muM-125 nM and maneb at concentrations of 10-1 muM. These conditions were studied both in highly purified NK cells and in a mixture of lymphocytes containing both T and NK cells. As little as 25 nM TBT decreased the function of purified NK cells after 24 and 48 h, whereas 10 nM TBT was effective after 6 days. The lowest level of TPT that was effective at 24 h was 50 nM whereas the results after 48 h and 6 days were similar to those seen with TBT. The presence of T lymphocytes diminished the effects of both TBT and TPT on NK cytotoxic function. A concentration of ziram as low as 125 nM produced significant loss of cytotoxic function in highly purified NK cells (65% decrease in function after 6 days). The toxicity of each of the compounds studied increased very significantly with length of exposure.

Groups of fish were fed with a basal diet (controls) or with the basal diet supplemented with glucan for two different periods of time before being bath challenged with the bacterium. Groups of fish fed with 1 and 10 g kg(-1) of glucan for a short period (2 weeks with glucan and 1 week with the basal diet) showed a higher degree of protection against pasteurellosis than the control group. This was especially pronounced in groups of fish fed with the higher concentrations of glucan. The respiratory burst and phagocytic activity of spleen phagocytes varied with time but no significant differences were found between groups in the third week when the challenge was carried out. The group of fish fed with 1 g kg(-1) of glucan for longer periods of time (2 weeks with glucan, 1 week with the basal diet, 2 weeks with glucan, and I week with the basal diet) also showed enhanced protection against P damselae. However, the group fed with 5 g kg(-1) had mortality rates comparable to the control group, and protection in the group fed with 10 g kg(-1) of glucan was significantly lower than in the control group. These results suggest that glucans can be used in the diet to prevent or reduce mortalities in gilthead seabream due to pasteurellosis, and they show the importance of the concentration and the period of administration of glucan to obtain optimal protection against this disease.

The precise nature of the defects and their relative distribution can often provide clues as to the type of contamination. Such inferences clearly require baseline data on the frequency of such deformities, and that is the purpose of this paper. For Mid-continent lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) nesting at La Perouse Bay, the current rate of gross external abnormalities among embryos and near-hatch goslings at hatch is 3.937 X 10(-4) per egg (95% confidence limits 1.7053 X 10(-4) to 6.507 X 10(-4)) and is consistent with estimates made for other species in minimally or uncontaminated habitats. Among the abnormal specimens, however, the relative distribution of defects of the beak and eye is not consistent with rates of spontaneous abnormalities reported for chickens. If the higher relative frequency of beak defects persists in future or other geographic samples displaying overall levels of abnormalities higher than our benchmark, then contaminants acting as type 1 teratogens should be suspected. Of the compounds this increasingly agriculturally dependent species is exposed to, insecticides rather than herbicides would be the more likely class of candidates. We urge others who may have similar data on other species to make it more broadly available since such benchmarks are crucial for the use of birds as bioindicators of environmental conditions.

In toxicology, clinical biochemistry can be used to search for diverse toxic effects in laboratory animal species through experiments about the evaluation of the toxicity of xenobiotics such as pesticides, human or veterinary drugs. As environment is concerned, animal clinical biochemistry can be used to investigate the possible effects of endocrine modulators in various species, which is currently a major environmental concern. It can also help evaluate the effects of pollution in fish.        All the results obtained with clinical biochemistry lead to an evidence : in all animals, there is a system of chemical defense based on a large number of mechanisms, which allow to fight efficiently against this type of aggression. This system of defense has many similarities with the immune system : immaturity at birth, inducibility, specificity, overflow by toxic effects when doses are too high. Moreover, the actions of this system allow to better understand the concept of hormesis, elaborated in the latest years, which shows that in many cases low doses of toxicants can have beneficial effects on vital processes.

S. and do Vale, Ana",,eng,,,"AIP56 (apoptosis-inducing protein of 56 kDa) is a metalloprotease AB toxin secreted by Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida that acts by cleaving NF-κB.  During infection, AIP56 spreads systemically and depletes phagocytes by  postapoptotic secondary necrosis, impairing the host phagocytic defense and  contributing to the genesis of infection-associated necrotic lesions. Here we  show that mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMDM) intoxicated by AIP56  undergo NF-κB p65 depletion and apoptosis. Similarly to what was reported for sea  bass phagocytes, intoxication of mBMDM involves interaction of AIP56 C-terminal  region with cell surface components, suggesting the existence of a conserved  receptor. Biochemical approaches and confocal microscopy revealed that AIP56  undergoes clathrin-dependent endocytosis, reaches early endosomes, and follows  the recycling pathway. Translocation of AIP56 into the cytosol requires endosome  acidification, and an acidic pulse triggers translocation of cell surface-bound  AIP56 into the cytosol. Accordingly, at acidic pH, AIP56 becomes more  hydrophobic, interacting with artificial lipid bilayer membranes. Altogether,  these data indicate that AIP56 is a short-trip toxin that reaches the cytosol  using an acidic-pH-dependent mechanism, probably from early endosomes. Usually,  for short-trip AB toxins, a minor pool reaches the cytosol by translocating from  endosomes, whereas the rest is routed to lysosomes for degradation. Here we  demonstrate that part of endocytosed AIP56 is recycled back and released  extracellularly through a mechanism requiring phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)  activity but independent of endosome acidification. So far, we have been unable  to detect biological activity of recycled AIP56, thereby bringing into question  its biological relevance as well as the importance of the recycling pathway.",,10.1128/IAI.02623-14,"*Apoptosis;Animals;Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism;Bacterial Toxins/*metabolism;Cell Survival;Cells, Cultured;Cytosol/chemistry;Endocytosis;Endosomes/chemistry;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Macrophages/microbiology/physiology;Male;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Microscopy, Confocal;NF-kappa B/*metabolism;Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism;Photobacterium/*metabolism;Protein Transport;Proteolysis",NA,NA,intracellular trafficking of aip56 an nfκbcleaving toxin from photobacterium damselae subsp piscicida

In this ultrasound-assisted microextraction (UAME),  chloroform was emulsified with an aqueous sample solution containing trace  fenitrothion (MEP) by ultrasonic irradiation (48 kHz) for 5 min. The emulsion was  then demulsified by ultrasonic irradiation (2.4 MHz) for 10 min. This resulted in  phase separation of the water and chloroform without centrifugation. The  demulsified chloroform was collected by a microsyringe and submitted to gas  chromatography-mass spectrometry. In conventional extraction with mechanical  stirring, the extraction recovery (ER) of MEP was strongly dependent on the  sample/chloroform volume ratio. However, in UAME, the ER was independent of the  volume ratio and the ER was >80 % when the enrichment factor was 40. In UAME, MEP  was rapidly extracted into the chloroform because of the large specific surface  areas of the small chloroform droplets in the oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion. This  gave a high extraction efficiency for MEP. UAME is a simple method requiring only  a change in the ultrasound frequency and with no pretreatment steps that could  contaminate the sample.

The diverse functions of these  proteins were identified, including amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress  defense and energy production. Interestingly, superoxidase dismutase and thiol  peroxidase were the most significantly down-regulated by EsrB. Furthermore, other  reported reactive oxygen species (ROS) resistance-related genes were also  down-regulated by EsrB as revealed by quantitative real-time. Compared with the  wild-type and the complement strain esrB(+), ΔesrB displayed a significantly  enhanced ROS resistance. These results demonstrated that EsrB plays important  roles in the ROS resistance pathway in E. piscicida grown in LB conditions.",,10.1093/femsle/fnw269,"*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial;*Proteomics;Animals;Bacterial Proteins/*genetics;Edwardsiella piscicida;Edwardsiella/*genetics/*physiology;Enterobacteriaceae Infections/microbiology/veterinary;EsrB, comparative proteomics;Fish Diseases/microbiology;Hemolysin Proteins/genetics;Humans;Mutation;Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism;ROS;Stress, Physiological/*genetics;Superoxide Dismutase/genetics;Virulence Factors/genetics;Proteomics;Proteome;Reactive Oxygen Species;Oxygenators",NA,NA,comparative proteomic analysis unravels a role for esrb in the regulation of reactive oxygen species stress responses in edwardsiella piscicida

Increasing evidence suggests that many risk factors for AD are modifiable. AD  pathology develops over decades. Hence risk reduction interventions require very  long follow-ups to show effects on AD incidence. Focussing on AD risk, instead of  diagnosis, provides a more realistic target for prevention strategies. We  developed a novel methodology that yields a global approach to risk assessment  for AD for use in population-based settings and interventions. The methodology  was used to develop a risk assessment tool that can be updated as more evidence  becomes available. First, a systematic search strategy identified risk and  protective factors for AD. Eleven risk factors and four protective factors for AD  were identified for which odds ratios were published or could be calculated (age,  sex, education, body mass index, diabetes, depression, serum cholesterol,  traumatic brain injury, smoking, alcohol intake, social engagement, physical  activity, cognitive activity, fish intake, and pesticide exposure). An algorithm  was developed to combine the odds ratios into an AD risk score. The approach  allows for interactions among risk factors which provides for their varying  impact over the life-course as current evidence suggests midlife is a critical  period for some risk factors. Finally, a questionnaire was developed to assess  the risk and protective factors by self-report. Compared with developing risk  indices on single cohort studies, this approach allows for more risk factors to  be included, greater generalizeability of results, and incorporation of  interactions based on findings from different stages of the lifecourse.",,10.1007/s11121-012-0313-2,"*Population Surveillance;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Alzheimer Disease/*epidemiology/prevention & control;Female;Humans;Male;Risk Factors;Alzheimer Disease",NA,NA,development of a new method for assessing global risk of alzheimers disease for use in population health approaches to prevention

Widespread marine pollution such as oil spills, persistent organic  pollutants, metals, and ocean plastic pollution has been linked to concerning  changes in the ecophysiology and health of Galápagos species. Simultaneously,  illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing are reshaping the composition and  structure of endemic and native Galápagos pelagic communities. In this novel  review, we discuss the impact of anthropogenic pollutants and their associated  ecotoxicological implications for Galápagos species in the face of climate change  stressors. We emphasize the importance of considering fishing pressure and marine  pollution, in combination with climate-change impacts, when assessing the  evolutionary fitness of species inhabiting the Galápagos. For example, the  survival of endemic marine iguanas has been negatively affected by organic  hydrocarbons introduced via oil spills, and endangered Galápagos sea lions  exhibit detectable concentrations of DDT, triggering potential feminization  effects and compromising the species' survival. During periods of ocean warming  (El Niño events) when endemic species undergo nutritional stress, climate change  may increase the vulnerability of these species to the impacts of pollutants,  resulting in the species reaching its population tipping point. Marine plastics  are emerging as a deleterious and widespread threat to endemic species. The  Galápagos is treasured for its historical significance and its unparalleled  living laboratory and display of evolutionary processes; however, this unique and  iconic paradise will remain in jeopardy until multidisciplinary and comprehensive  preventative management plans are put in place to mitigate and eliminate the  effects of anthropogenic stressors facing the islands today.

Influent and effluent  wastewaters were submitted to solid phase extraction on Oasis HLB cartridges,  followed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography Orbitrap high-resolution  mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Orbitrap MS). Influent concentrations in both WWTPs were  notably higher than effluent, with caffeine, acetaminophen, irbesartan and  valsartan being the most ubiquitous compounds, exhibiting elevated  concentrations.

In conjunction with refuges of non-Bt host plants, fitness costs can delay  the evolution of resistance. Furthermore, fitness costs often vary with  ecological conditions, suggesting that agricultural landscapes can be manipulated  to magnify fitness costs and thereby prolong the efficacy of Bt crops. In the  current study, we tested the effects of four species of entomopathogenic  nematodes (Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) on the magnitude and dominance  of fitness costs of resistance to Bt toxin CrylAc in pink bollworm, Pectinophora  gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae).

For protection of aquatic life,  regulators need to know what levels of contaminants a water body can tolerate,  without producing adverse effects. The USEPA has developed water quality criteria  for many chemicals, but few are for current-use pesticides. Other countries also  derive aquatic life criteria utilizing a variety of methodologies. As a prelude  to developing a new criteria derivation methodology, this chapter explores the  current state of aquatic life criteria derivation around the world. Rather than  discussing each methodology independently, this review is organized according to  critical elements that must be part of a scientifically defensible methodology.  All of the reviewed methodologies rely on effects data to derive aquatic life  criteria. Water quality criteria may be derived from single-species toxicity data  by statistical extrapolation procedures (for adequate data sets), or by use of  empirically based AFs (for data sets of any size). Assessment factor methods are  conservative and have a low probability of underestimating risk, with a  concomitant high probability of overestimating risk. Extrapolation methods may  also under-, or overestimate risk, but uncertainty is quantifiable and is reduced  when larger data sets are used. Although less common, methods are also available  for criteria derivation using multispecies toxicity data. Environmental toxicity  of chemicals is affected by several factors. Some of these factors can be  addressed in criteria derivation, and some cannot. For example, factors such as  magnitude, duration and frequency of exposure may be incorporated into criteria,  either through use of time-to-event and population models or by derivation of  both acute and chronic criteria that have duration and frequency components.  Aquatic species may be exposed to hydrophobic organic chemicals by multiple  routes. They may take up residues directly from water, or may be exposed  dietarily, or combinations of both. Unfortunately, to properly address such  multiple routes in criteria derivation, food web models are needed that work for  chemicals that have specific modes of action. Similarly, both bioavailability and  toxicity parameters may contribute to derivation of criteria, providing  sufficient data are available. Ecotoxicological effects and physical-chemical  data are needed for criteria derivation. The quality and quantity of required  data are clearly stated in existing methodologies; some guidelines provide very  specific data quality requirements. The level of detail provided by guidelines  varies among methodologies. Most helpful are those that provide lists of  acceptable data sources, descriptions of adequate data searches, schemes for  rating ecotoxicity data, specifications of required data types (e.g., acute vs  chronic), and instructions for data reduction. Many methodologies present  procedures for deriving criteria from both large and small data sets. Very small  data sets may be supplemented through the use of QSARs for selected pesticides,  and through the use of models such as ICE (for prediction of toxicity to  under-tested species), and ACE (for estimation of chronic toxicity from acute  data). The toxicity of mixtures is addressed by several existing methodologies.  In some cases, additional AFs are applied to criteria to account for exposure to  mixtures, whereas in others, concentration addition models are used to assess  compliance. Multiple stressors and bioaccumulation are also addressed in some  methodologies, by providing for application of additional safety factors. Methods  are also available for translating dietary exposure limits for humans or other  fish-eating animals into water concentrations. Options for addressing the safety  of TES exist, and rely heavily on data from surrogate species to derive criteria.  Utilizing partition coefficients, criteria may be harmonized across media to  ensure that levels set to protect one compartment do not result in unacceptable  levels in other compartments. Several methodologies derive criteria from entire  data sets through the use of statistical extrapolations; other methods utilize  only the lowest (most sensitive) data point or points. Utilization of entire data  sets allows derivation of confidence limits for criteria, and encourages data  generation. Criteria derivation methodologies have improved over the past two  decades as they have incorporated more ecological risk assessment techniques. No  single existing methodology is ideal, but elements of several may be combined,  and when used with newer risk assessment tools, will produce more usable and  flexible criteria derivation procedures that are protective.",,,"Animals;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Databases, Factual;Fresh Water;Humans;Pesticide Residues/*analysis/*toxicity;Water Pollutants, Chemical/*analysis/*toxicity;Pesticides",NA,NA,methods for deriving pesticide aquatic life criteria

The application of certain techniques has the potential to  enhance various aspects of plant development, including growth, yield, proximate  content (such as protein and carbohydrate levels), as well as the ability to  withstand abiotic stresses such as herbicide exposure. The current investigation  focused on examining the influence of bioactive compounds derived from the  cyanobacterium Neowestiellopsis persica strain A1387 on enhancing the antioxidant  and anyimicrobial activity of wheat plants in their defense against the plant  pathogenic Sunn pest. The findings of the study indicate that the levels of  H(2)O(2) and GP(x) in wheat plants that were infected with aphids were  significantly elevated compared to the treatments where aphids and cyanobacteria  extract were present. The confirmation of these results was achieved through the  utilization of confocal and fluorescent microscope tests, respectively.  Furthermore, the findings indicated that the constituents of the cyanobacterial  extract augmented the plant's capacity to withstand stress by enhancing its  defense mechanisms. In a broader context, the utilization of cyanobacterial  extract demonstrated the ability to regulate the generation and impact of oxygen  (O(2)) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), while concurrently enhancing the  functionality of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione  peroxidase (GP(x)) enzymes within wheat plants.

Werres & A.W.A.M. de Cock was isolated from leaflets of wood rose (Rosa gymnocarpa Nutt.), a native, low shrub of the  Rosaceae family, at the Jack London State Park in Sonoma County, California.  Affected leaflets had cream-to-brown lesions or spots, sometimes delimited by a  chlorotic zone. Lesions coalesced with time and spread into the petiole and  rachis. Lesions on the stems were not observed. Isolates were typical of P.  ramorum with large chlamydospores and caduceus, semipapillate sporangia, and the  sequence (GenBank Accession No. AY526571) of the internal transcribed spacer  (ITS) region of the rDNA matched those published previously (4). The site was a  mixed forest containing some confirmed P. ramorum-infected trees of coast redwood  (Sequoia sempervirens), bay laurel (Umbellularia californica), and tanoak  (Lithocarpus densiflorus) (3,4). These sites also contained California rose (R.  californica Cham. & Schldl.); however, no symptoms were observed on this species.  A terminal leaflet of asymptomatic, pesticide-free, potted-plants of California  rose and wood rose (four plants each) was inoculated with zoospores of a P.  ramorum isolate (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, ATCC MYA-3281;  Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures, Baarn, the Netherlands, CBS 114390)  obtained from infected wood rose (2). A control leaflet of each plant was dipped  in sterile deionized water. Branches containing the inoculated and control  leaflets were placed in moist plastic bags, and plants were maintained at 21 to  22°C in the laboratory for 6 days. The inoculation experiment was repeated. In  both inoculations, brown lesions (extending up to 8 mm from the leaflet tip) were  observed on leaflets of both species 2 days after inoculation with P. ramorum. At  6 days after inoculation, lesions starting from the leaflet tip averaged 12.2 mm  in length (range 10 to 16 mm) for wood rose and 9.6 mm (range 3 to 20 mm) for  California rose. Some lesions extended into the petiole in both rose species.  Sporangia were observed in washings of the lesions from four plants of California  rose and one plant of wood rose, and P. ramorum was reisolated on  Phytophthora-selective agar medium modified with 25 mg of pentachloronitrobenzene  (PCNB) (4) from all lesions. Control leaflets had no lesions, and P. ramorum was  not reisolated. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a species of Rosa  as a natural host for P. ramorum, although R. sempervirens was identified as  being susceptible in artificial inoculations of detached leaves (E. Moralejo and  L. Hernández, personal communication). Toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia) in  California and salmon berry (Rubus spectabilis) in Oregon are the other known  hosts from the family Rosaceae (1). Wood rose is popular in the horticultural  industry and is readily available from native plant nurseries in California,  Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, Canada. California rose is also  popular, primarily in California. The pathogen could be disseminated on these  plants, especially since sporangia were obtained from inoculated leaflets of  these two species. References: (1) J. M. Davidson et al.

Each night (18:00h-07:00h), trained residents  recorded human activities indoors, in peri-domestic outdoor areas, and in  communal gatherings. Host-seeking mosquitoes were repeatedly collected indoors  and outdoors hourly, using miniaturized exposure-free double net traps (DN-Mini)  occupied by volunteers. In-depth interviews were conducted with household  representatives to explore perceptions on persistent malaria and its control.  Higher proportions of people stayed outdoors than indoors in early-evening and  early-morning hours, resulting in higher exposures outdoors than indoors during  these times. However, exposure during late-night hours (22:00h-05:00h) occurred  mostly indoors. Some of the popular activities that kept people outdoors included  cooking, eating, relaxing and playing. All households had at least one bed net,  and 83.9% of people had access to ITNs. Average ITN use was 96.3%, preventing  most indoor exposure. Participants recorgnized the importance of ITNs but also  noted that the nets were not perfect. No complementary interventions were  reported being used widely. Most people believed transmission happens after  midnight. We conclude that insecticide-treated nets, where properly used, can  still prevent most indoor exposures, but significant risk continues unabated  before bedtime, outdoors and at communal gatherings. Such exposure is greatest  for rural and low-income households. There is therefore an urgent need for  complementary interventions, particularly those targeting outdoor-biting and are  applicable for all people including the marginalised populations such as  migratory farmers and fishermen.

This communication reports the identification of venom components of  this scorpion with biological activity over insects/crickets (Acheta domestica),  crustaceans/fresh water shrimps (Cambarellus montezumae), and mammalians/mice  (Mus musculus, strain CD1). It also describes the pharmacological effects on cell  lines in culture (L5178Y cells, HeLa cells, HuTu cells and Jurkat E6-1 cells), as  well as on several types of bacteria (see below). The soluble venom of this  scorpion was fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and  collected separately in twelve independent fractions collected over 60 min run  (5 min time apart each other). The HPLC components of fraction VII were lethal to  all three species used for assay. The IVth fraction had a toxic effect on  freshwater shrimps. In this species, fractions VI, VII and VIII were all lethal.  For crickets, fractions V and VI were toxic and fraction VII was lethal. In  mouse, the lethal components were found in fraction VII, whereas fraction VIII  was toxic, but not lethal, at the doses assayed. The molecular weight of peptides  from the various group of fractions were identified by mass spectrometry  determination. Components lethal to mice showed molecular weights from 7013 to  7487 Da. Two peptides were obtained in homogeneous form and shown to be lethal to  the three species of animal used for assay. The soluble venom tested on L5178Y  cell line survival was shown to be cytotoxic, at 10-100 μg/mL concentration, when  compared to control murine splenocytes (p = 0.007). The soluble venom applied to  Hela, Hutu and Jurkat cell lines did not show cytotoxic effects at these  concentrations. On the contrary, it seems to have a proliferative effect. However  the HPLC fractions I, III, VI and XII do have a cytotoxic effect on Jurkat  E06-1 cells in culture at 200 μg/mL concentration. The antimicrobial activity of  the venom fractions on Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive), Escherichia coli,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa y Salmonella spp (gram-negative) was measured, using the  liquid inhibition growth system.

A key component of this roadmap  is to provide universal national coverage with long-lasting insecticide-treated  nets (LLINs) in support of achieving the primary goal of reducing both morbidity  and mortality from malaria by 30% in the first three years, followed by a further  reduction of 20% by end of the programme cycle in 2020 1. The strategic plan  calls for this target to be supported by a comprehensive information, education  and communication (IEC) programme; however, there is limited prior research into  household and personal usage patterns to assist in the creation of targeted,  effective, and socio-culturally specific behaviour change materials. METHODS:  Nine separate focus group discussions (FGDs) were carried out in Dili, Manatuto,  and Covalima districts, Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, in July 2010.These  focus groups primarily explored themes of perceived malaria risk, causes of  malaria, net usage patterns within families, barriers to correct and consistent  usage, and the daily experience of users (both male and female) in households  with at least one net. Comprehensive qualitative analysis utilized open source  analysis software. RESULTS: The primary determinants of net usage were a  widespread perception that nets could or should only be used by pregnant women  and young children, and the availability of sufficient sleeping space under a  limited number of nets within households. Both nuisance biting and disease  prevention were commonly cited as primary motivations for usage, while  seasonality was not a significant factor. Long-term net durability and ease of  hanging were seen as key attributes in net design preference. Very frequent  washing cycles were common, potentially degrading net effectiveness. Finally,  extensive re-purposing of nets (fishing, protecting crops) was both reported and  observed, and may significantly decrease availability of nighttime sleeping space  for all family members if distributed nets do not remain within the household.  CONCLUSIONS: Emphasizing that net usage is acceptable and important for all  family members regardless of age or gender, and addressing the complex  behavioural economics of alternative net usages could have significant impacts on  malaria control efforts in Timor-Leste, as the country's programmes make progress  towards universal net coverage.",,10.1186/1475-2875-10-199,"*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;*Insecticide-Treated Bednets;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Focus Groups;Humans;Indonesia;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Malaria/*prevention & control;Male;Middle Aged;Mosquito Control/*methods;Pregnancy;Protective Devices/*statistics & numerical data;Young Adult",NA,NA,an exploratory study of treatedbed nets in timorleste patterns of intended and alternative usage

The analyses revealed that Malaria has  reached an epidemic proportion and despite major inroads by PSI in combating  malaria on the principles of social marketing, the strategies of pricing and  segmentation of the clients are not appropriate for Sub-Saharan African countries  that are mired in absolute poverty where majority of the rural communities eke a  living on less than a dollar per day and the health sector does not receive  priority attention from policy makers and politicians. The descriptive statistics  and a one sample t test for the sampled countries suggest that sub-Saharan  countries have not even met the hypothesized 5% investment of their GDP on  health, compared to their counterparts, the developed countries, who are all  above this figure. The null hypothesis that there is no significant different  between the population and the sample means of both developed and a developing  country in their investments in the health sector was also tested and rejected.  Though the elements in some of the existent models and theories of social  marketing such as Health Belief Model, Theory of Reasoned Action, Social  Cognitive Theory and Trans-theoretical Models all attempt to advocate for  elimination of constraints and barriers to effective access to a service or  product, PSI is adamant to these and try to generalize these principles in all  contexts, including in Sub-Saharan Africa. The African scenario, where about 90%  of Malaria related deaths cases in the world occur, demands more than what these  theories present. Accordingly, it was concluded that however good intentioned  social marketing is, in the case of ITNs in this region, it is counter productive  as the pricing de-motivates clients who usually have other pressing needs to  address and segmentation limits coverage. Social marketing is thus more relevant  to developed economies where absolute poverty no longer exist and people can  afford to pay for health services. Malaria in sub-Saharan Africa needs a ""carpet  bombing"" strategy. It was also concluded that for Sub-Saharan countries to  effectively address the MDG six on malaria, and implement the Abuja Summit and  the Roll Back Malaria partnership declarations, it requires a high degree of  political commitment, amongst others, to enable the vulnerable communities have  access to free malaria treatment related drugs. Partners in the fight against  malaria such as PSI should adopt a more eclectic intervention strategy, and be  cognizant of the fact that the strategy that works for Africa should be that  which is based on strict equity and stimulates demand for ITNs. The paper  concludes by agreeing with Professors Curtis and Sachs that comprehensive malaria  control in Africa is achievable by 2010, at the minimal cost if sound principles  of public health and economics are observed. Millions of lives can be saved and  Africa will be given vital help in escaping from the viscous circle of poverty  and diseases that continue to grip the continent. The target for all intervention  efforts should be to eliminate the cost factor and ensure free distribution of  all malaria related treatment products.",,,"*Insecticide-Treated Bednets;*Social Marketing;Africa South of the Sahara;Bedding and Linens/*statistics & numerical data;Humans;Insecticides;Malaria/*prevention & control;Mosquito Control/*methods;Organizations, Nonprofit/*organization & administration;Socioeconomic Factors;Malaria;Social Marketing",NA,NA,social marketing and the fight against malaria in africa population services international psi and insecticide treated nets itns

Few studies have been  performed to investigate the effects of these toxic agents on intracellular  structures of diatom cells. Nuclear alterations and cell wall abnormalities were  reported for diatoms exposed to toxic compounds. Nevertheless, the cellular  mechanisms implicated in the development of such alterations and abnormalities  remain unclear. Sensitivity to pesticides is known to be quite different among  different diatom species. Eutrophic and small species are recognized for their  tolerance to pesticides exposure. More pronounced cell defenses against oxidative  stress may explain this absence of sensitivity in species of smaller physical  size. Notwithstanding, on the whole, explaining the rationale behind tolerance  variations among species has been quite difficult, thus far. In this context, the  understanding of intracellular toxicity in diatoms and the relation between these  intracellular effects and the disturbance of species composition in communities  represent a key target for further research. The original community species  structure determines the response of a diatom community to toxic agent exposure.  Diatom communities that have species capable of switching from autotrophic to  heterotrophic modes, when photosynthesis is inhibited (e.g., after pesticide  exposure), can continue to grow, even in the presence of high pesticide  pollution. How diatoms respond to toxic stress, and the degree to which they  respond, also depends on cell and community health, on ecological interactions  with other organisms, and on general environmental conditions. The general  structural parameters of diatom communities (biomass, global cell density) are  less sensitive to pesticide effects than are the specific structural parameters  of the unicellular organisms themselves (cell density by species, species  composition). For benthic species, biofilm development and grazing on this matrix  as a source of food for invertebrates and fishes may also modify the response of  diatom communities. Environmental parameters (light exposure, nutrient  concentrations, and hydraulic conditions) affect, and often interfere with, the  response of diatoms to pesticides. Therefore, the complexity of aquatic  ecosystems and the complexity of pesticide to easily detect the effects of such  pollutants on diatoms. Clearly more research will be required to address this  problem.",,10.1007/978-1-4419-1352-4_2,"Animals;Diatoms/cytology/*drug effects;Fresh Water;Pesticides/*toxicity;Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity;Pesticides",NA,NA,effects of pesticides on freshwater diatoms

BACKGROUND:  Multiple chemical sensitivity is poorly understood with few providers  specialising in its treatment. This lack of treatment and the ubiquity of  chemicals engender severe life impacts such as job loss, financial loss, social  isolation and even homelessness for persons who experience these sensitivities.  DESIGN: Survey. METHOD: We examined chemical incitants, symptoms and  sickness-related behavioural dysfunction as measured by the Sickness Impact  Profile in 254 persons self-identified with multiple chemical sensitivity.  RESULTS: Chemicals rated as causing the most symptomatology in respondents were  pesticide, formaldehyde, fresh paint, new carpet, diesel exhaust, perfume and air  fresheners. The five highest rated symptoms in this sample were  tiredness/lethargy, difficulty concentrating, muscle aches, memory difficulties  and long-term fatigue. Overall mean Sickness Impact Profile score was 25.25%,  showing serious impairment, with the most serious dysfunction in the categories  of work (55.36%), alertness behaviour (53.45%) and recreation and pastimes  (45.20%).

Relative species sensitivity was compared using three  procedures: standard acute toxicity testing, fractional estimates of lethal  concentrations, and accelerated life testing chronic estimation procedures. The  acutely lethal concentrations (ALC) resulting in 50% mortality at 96 h (96-h  ALC50s) were determined using linear regression and indicated that the three  herbicides were toxic in the order of picloram acid > 2,4-D acid > clopyralid  acid. The 96-h ALC50 values for rainbow trout were as follows: picloram, 41 mg/L;  2.4-D, 707 mg/L; and clopyralid, 700 mg/L. The 96-h ALC50 values for bull trout  were as follows: picloram, 24 mg/L; 2.4-D, 398 mg/L; and clopyralid, 802 mg/L.  Fractional estimates of safe concentrations, based on 5% of the 96-h ALC50, were  conservative (overestimated toxicity) of regression-derived 96-h ALC5 values by  an order of magnitude. Accelerated life testing procedures were used to estimate  chronic lethal concentrations (CLC) resulting in 1% mortality at 30 d (30-d CLC1)  for the three herbicides: picloram (1 mg/L rainbow trout, 5 mg/L bull trout),  2,4-D (56 mg/L rainbow trout, 84 mg/L bull trout), and clopyralid (477 mg/L  rainbow trout; 552 mg/L bull trout). Collectively, the results indicated that the  standard surrogate rainbow trout is similar in sensitivity to bull trout.

W.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Humic substances (HS) comprise the majority of dead and living organic carbon, including organisms. In the environment, they are  considered to be chemically inert or at least refractory. Recent papers, however,  show that HS (including natural organic matter-NOM, isolated by reverse osmosis)  are natural chemicals which interact with aquatic organisms. They are taken up  and cause a variety of stress defense reactions which are well known from  man-made chemicals. These reactions include chaperon activation, induction and  modulation of biotrans-formation enzymes, or induction of antioxidant defense  enzymes. One specific reaction with freshwater plants is the reduction of  photosynthetic oxygen release. In this contribution, we compare the  susceptibilities (cell yield) of two closely related coccal green algae,  Monoraphidium convolutum and M. minutum, towards various NOM isolates. METHODS:  Cultures of M. convolutum and M. minutum were obtained from the algal collection  of the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Berlin, and  from the Culture Collection of Algae, Göttingen, and maintained in a common  medium. The cultures were non-axenic. The algae were exposed to 5 mg L(-1) DOC of  each humic material, an environmentally realistic concentration. Cell numbers  were counted microscopically in Neugebauer cuvettes in 5 replicates on days 1, 4,  7, 10, 14, and 21. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Almost all NOM isolates modulated the  growth of the algae. Only the NOM of a Norwegian raised peat bog lake did not  reveal any significant effect with M. convolutuim. In general, the results with  two algal species are by no means uniform. For instance, Suwannee River NOM  causes a decrease in cell density with M. minutum, but temporarily stimulates the  growth of M. convolutum. The opposite applies to Aurevann NOM: Growth increase in  M. minutum, but a bi-phasic response in M. convolutum. Different responses of  both Monoraphidium species must be attributed to intrinsic factors of the algae  rather than only to chemical features of the exposed materials, because the  exposures were identical with both algal species. The reduction in growth yields  can be explained as a herbicide-like mode of action that affects the photosystem  II most prevalently. The growth promoting effect remains somewhat obscure. It may  be due to (1) an increase in bioavailability of some trace nutrients in the  presence of HS, (2) the release of some growth promoting substances by microbial  or photochemical processing of the humic materials, and (3) a hormetic effect  upon the exposure of HS. Hormesis means stimulation of organisms or metabolic  activities when exposed to noxes in low concentrations. However, it is still open  to discussion why the growth promotion only applies to one or the other, but not  simultaneously to both Monoraphidium species. CONCLUSION: Exposure of the closely  related coccal green algal species to humic material changes their growth  characteristics. Since the reactions are not consistent within the two species  and the various humic materials, it seems that the less sensitive species is  favored by HS exposure. The environmental relevance, however, is subject to  future studies.",,10.1065/espr2006.06.317,*Humic Substances;Chlorophyta/*growth & development;Species Specificity,NA,NA,natural organic matter differently modulates growth of two closely related coccal green algal species

This study examined the  symptom and psychological profiles of 263 older adults (aged 60-90 y, 71% women,  29% men); 57% reported that at least one chemical and 17% reported that at least  four of five chemicals (pesticide, automobile exhaust, paint, new carpet,  perfume) made them feel ill. Cacosmia ratings correlated weakly and negatively  with age (r = -0.19, p = .001) over the whole sample. Cacosmia correlated  significantly with self-reported illness from foods that may mobilize or generate  opioid peptides (wheat, dairy, eggs) (r = 0.32, p < .0001) and with illness from  opiate drugs (r = 0.23, p < .0001). When the sample was divided into four cells  on the basis of above-versus below-median total chemical-induced illness score  (CI) and total food-induced illness score (FI), the high CI and high FI, high CI  only, and high FI only groups had more frequent indigestion, and the high CI  group had more frequent difficulty concentrating than the groups below median for  illness from both chemicals and foods (NOILL), even after covarying for age and  anxiety. The most cacosmic subjects noted higher prevalence of  physician-diagnosed allergies and irritable bowel than did noncacosmic subjects.  In contrast with previous young adult cohort studies, the older illness groups  did not differ with regard to sex distribution, depression, shyness, or  repressive defensiveness. When considered with prior surveys of young adults, the  present findings are consistent with the presence of previously established,  time-dependent sensitization to multiple xenobiotic agents in susceptible  individuals for whom psychological variables do not explain the symptom of  cacosmia. If cacosmia is a symptom of TDS, then the neuropharmacology literature  suggests the possibility of excitatory amino acid, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis, dopaminergic, and/or opioid involvement.

E. and Cimino, M. C. and Moore, M. M.",,eng,,,"OPP: This paper provides the rationale and support for the decisions the OPP will make in requiring and reviewing mutagenicity information. The regulatory  requirement for mutagenicity testing to support a pesticide registration is found  in the 40 CFR Part 158. The guidance as to the specific mutagenicity testing to  be performed is found in the OPP's Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, Subdivision  F, Hazard Evaluation: Human and Domestic Animals (referred to as the Subdivision  F guideline). A revised Subdivision F guideline has been presented that becomes  the current guidance for submitters of mutagenicity data to the OPP. The decision  to revise the guideline was the result of close examination of the version  published in 1982 and the desire to update the guidance based on developments  since then and current state-of-the-science. After undergoing Agency and public  scrutiny, the revised guideline is to be published in 1991. The revised guideline  consists of an initial battery of tests (the Salmonella assay, an in vitro  mammalian gene mutation assay and an in vivo cytogenetics assay which may be  either a bone marrow assay for chromosomal aberrations or for micronuclei  formation) that should provide an adequate initial assessment of the potential  mutagenicity of a chemical. Follow-up testing to clarify results from the initial  testing may be necessary. After this information as well as all other relevant  information is obtained, a weight-of-evidence decision will be made about the  possible mutagenicity concern a chemical may present. Testing to pursue  qualitative and/or quantitative evidence for assessing heritable risk in relation  to human beings will then be considered if a mutagenicity concern exists. This  testing may range from tests for evidence of gonadal exposure to dominant lethal  testing to quantitative tests such as the specific locus and heritable  translocation assays. The mutagenicity assessment will be performed in accordance  with the Agency's Mutagenicity Risk Assessment Guidelines. The mutagenicity data  would also be used in the weight-of-evidence consideration for the potential  carcinogenicity of a chemical in accordance with the Agency's Carcinogen Risk  Assessment Guidelines. In instances where there are triggers for carcinogenicity  testing, mutagenicity data may be used as one of the triggers after a  consideration of available information. It is felt that the revised Subdivision F  guideline will provide appropriate, and more specific, guidance concerning the  OPP approach to mutagenicity testing for the registration of a pesticide.

The demographic transition, a long established concept, refers to  the change from a stage of high birth rates and mortality rates to one of low  birth rates and mortality rates. The mortality rates have always decreased before  the birth rates, giving rise to a period of rapid population growth in each  society. The recently-coined term ""health transition"" provides a more detailed  view of the different aspects of the mortality decline and of the changes in  morbidity and causes of morbidity which also accompany economic development. The  health transition is associated with major changes in exposure to environmental  and occupational health hazards. The traditional hazards of the pre-industrial  stage include unsafe drinking-water, poor sanitation, infected food, tropical  disease vectors, indoor air pollution from biomass smoke, and accidents in  agriculture and fishing. Gradually these are replaced by or overlap with the  modern hazards, such as urban air pollution, tobacco smoking, pesticides,  occupational hazards in new industries and traffic accidents. The health impact  of these hazards depends very much on the preventive measures taken. For some  hazards there is an increasing health risk, in parallel with the increasing  occurrence of the hazard, which is followed by a decreasing health risk as  preventive actions become effective.

To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the  compounds, possible mechanisms of antifungal action, and synergistic effects,  microdilution testing in broth was used. The structures of the synthesized  products were characterized with FTIR spectroscopy, (1) H-NMR, (13) C-NMR, and  HRMS.

In biomedicine the small-molecules targeting  cytoskeletal elements are in the frontline of anticancer research with  plant-derived cytoskeletal drugs such as Vinca alkaloids and toxoids, being  routinely used in the clinical practice. Moreover, plants are also major  material, food and energy resources for human activities ranging from  agriculture, textile industry, carpentry, energy production and new material  development to name some few.

As distribution of ITNs throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is being  scaled up, maintaining maximal levels of coverage will be necessary to sustain  current gains. The effectiveness of mass distribution of ITNs, requires careful  analysis of successes and failures if impacts are to be sustained over the long  term. METHODS: Mass distribution of ITNs to a rural Kenyan community along Lake  Victoria was performed in early 2011. Surveyors collected data on ITN use both  before and one year following this distribution. At both times, household  representatives were asked to provide a complete accounting of ITNs within the  dwelling, the location of each net, and the ages and genders of each person who  slept under that net the previous night. Other data on household material  possessions, education levels and occupations were recorded. Information on  malaria preventative factors such as ceiling nets and indoor residual spraying  was noted. Basic information on malaria knowledge and health-seeking behaviours  was also collected. Patterns of ITN use before and one year following net  distribution were compared using spatial and multi-variable statistical methods.  Associations of ITN use with various individual, household, demographic and  malaria related factors were tested using logistic regression. RESULTS: After  infancy (<1 year), ITN use sharply declined until the late teenage years then  began to rise again, plateauing at 30 years of age. Males were less likely to use  ITNs than females. Prior to distribution, socio-economic factors such as parental  education and occupation were associated with ITN use. Following distribution,  ITN use was similar across social groups. Household factors such as availability  of nets and sleeping arrangements still reduced consistent net use, however.  CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive, direct-to-household, mass distribution of ITNs was  effective in rapidly scaling up coverage, with use being maintained at a high  level at least one year following the intervention. Free distribution of ITNs  through direct-to-household distribution method can eliminate important  constraints in determining consistent ITN use, thus enhancing the sustainability  of effective intervention campaigns.",,10.1186/1475-2875-13-466,"Humans;Male;Female;Infant;Child;Middle Aged;Adult;Aged;Young Adult;Adolescent;Rural Population;Aged, 80 and over;Infant, Newborn;Malaria/*prevention & control;Insecticide-Treated Bednets/*statistics & numerical data;Child, Preschool;Disease Transmission, Infectious/*prevention & control;Health Services Research;Kenya;Victoria;Insecticides",NA,NA,insecticidetreated net use before and after mass distribution in a fishing community along lake victoria kenya successes and unavoidable pitfalls

J. and Fogle, D. G. and Tidwell, T. E.",,eng,,,"In November 2002, a disease was observed on eight cultivars of Asiatic hybrid lilies (Lilium sp.) in two fields in Carpinteria, CA. The same disease was  observed on greenhouse grown Asiatic hybrid lilies in Nipomo, CA in an adjacent  county. 'Monte Negro' was the most severely affected. Symptoms consisted of  necrotic leaf tips as well as 5- to 10-mm ellipsoidal necrotic spots on stems and  the abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces. Lesions were initially dark brown and  water soaked, becoming lighter as they dried. Although leaf spot symptoms usually  began at the leaf tip, eventually the entire leaf would become blighted. Disease  symptoms were not observed on Oriental hybrid lilies in the same nurseries. A  Botrytis sp. was consistently associated with the disease symptoms. In pure  culture, the fungus matched the description of Botryotinia sphaerosperma  (Gregory) Buchw. (anamorph Botrytis sphaerosperma (Gregory) Buchw.) (1). The  fungus is distinguished by its large, spherical conidia that average 23 to 25 μm  in diameter at maturity. The conidia are born in compact heads on unbranched  conidiophores. Conidia and conidiophores are hyaline when young. At maturity, the  conidia turn dark brown, whereas the conidiophores turn blackish brown. The  fungus formed abundant sclerotia on potato dextrose agar when incubated at room  temperature with 12 h per day of fluorescent lighting. The sclerotia were black,  ovate to sphaeroidal, had a rough surface, and were 1.5 to 2.5 × 1 to 2.5 mm.  Apothecia were not observed. Pathogenicity was tested on 12 Asiatic hybrid and 12  Oriental hybrid lilies. Inoculum consisting of mycelial fragments and conidia (1  × 10(5) conidia per ml) was produced on lily leaf agar (500 ml of H(2)O, 7.5 g of  agar, and 25 g of healthy, macerated lily leaves). Plants were inoculated by  rubbing leaves and stems with the spore and mycelial fragment suspension using  cotton swabs. Plants were maintained in a greenhouse at 25°C. After 7 days,  characteristic lesions were observed on the leaves and stems of Asiatic hybrid  and Oriental hybrid lilies, from which the same Botrytis sp. was consistently  isolated. Three control plants each of Asiatic hybrid and Oriental hybrid lilies  treated with water as a check, remained symptomless. Although studies to  determine potential fungicides for controlling this pathogen have not yet been  undertaken, good sanitation, a lily-free period, and steam sterilization of beds  should be considered in the management of this disease. In Europe, this fungus  has been reported as a pathogen on Lilium regale (2). To our knowledge, this is  the first report of this pathogen in North America.

H. and Tibenderana, James K.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) through universal coverage campaigns is a widely adopted approach for the prevention of  malaria at scale. While post-distribution surveys play a valuable role in  determining cross-sectional levels of LLIN retention and use, as well as  frequently cited reasons for non-use, few studies have explored the consistency  of LLIN use over time, within the expected lifespan of the net, and the factors  which may drive this. METHODS: In this qualitative study, 74 in-depth interviews  were conducted with (male) household heads and (female) caregivers of children in  LLIN recipient households, as well as community health workers, in Buliisa, Hoima  and Kiboga districts in Uganda, 25-29 months following a LLIN mass campaign  distribution. A triangulation approach to data analysis was taken, incorporating  thematic analysis, most significant change and positive deviance. RESULTS: The  factors found to be most influential in encouraging long-term LLIN use were  positive experience of net use prior to the distribution, and appreciation or  awareness of a range of benefits arising from their use, including protection  from malaria as well as importantly, other health, lifestyle, social and economic  benefits. Social support from within the community was also identified as an  important factor in determining continued use of LLINs. Net use appeared to be  more consistent amongst settled urban and rural communities, compared with  fishing, pastoralist, refugee and immigrant communities. CONCLUSIONS: A multitude  of interplaying factors encouraged consistent LLIN use in this setting. Whilst  the protection of malaria remains a powerful motivator, social and behaviour  change (SBC) strategies should also capitalize on the non-malaria benefits of net  use that provide a long-term rationale for consistent use. Where supplies are  available, SBC campaigns should promote replacement options, emphasizing ongoing  net care and replacement as a household responsibility, thus reducing dependence  on free distributions. The triangulation approach to qualitative data analysis  enabled increased confidence in the validity of findings and an enhanced  contextual understanding of the factors promoting consistent net use in  mid-western Uganda. The approach should be considered when designing future  studies to explore factors driving net retention and use trends.",,10.1186/s12936-016-1101-4,Humans;Male;Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Malaria/*prevention & control;Insecticide-Treated Bednets;Insecticides/*therapeutic use;Mosquito Control/*statistics & numerical data;Mosquito Nets/*statistics & numerical data;Uganda;Insecticides,NA,NA,what drives the consistent use of longlasting insecticidal nets over time a multimethod qualitative study in midwestern uganda

Recent molecular evidence suggests that  humpback dolphins in the Bay of Bengal may comprise a fifth species. These  moderate-sized dolphin species are found in shallow (<30m), coastal waters of the  eastern Atlantic, Indian, and western Pacific oceans. Abundance and trends have  only been studied in a few areas, mostly in eastern Africa, China, and northern  Australia. No global, empirically derived abundance estimates exist for any of  the four species, but none appear to number more than about 20,000 individuals.  Humpback dolphins feed mostly on small fishes, and sometimes shrimps; occur for  the most part in small groups (mostly 12 or less); have limited nearshore  movements; and in most parts of their range exhibit a fission/fusion type of  social organization. Major threats that affect all the species are entanglement  in fishing gear, and habitat degradation/destruction from various forms of  coastal development. Impacts from vessel traffic (including behavioural  disturbance and displacement, as well as mortality and morbidity from collisions  with vessels) appear to be significant in most areas. Several other threats are  apparently significant only in particular parts of the range of some species  (e.g. high levels of organochlorine contaminants affecting Indo-Pacific humpback  dolphins in Hong Kong). Direct hunting only occurs in limited areas and primarily  on a small scale. Conservation actions so far have been limited, with most  populations receiving little study and almost no management attention. Much more  work is needed on humpback dolphin population status, threats, and how the major  threats can be reduced or eliminated. Extinction risks for the four species and  some populations are preliminarily re-assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria  in the current volume. The results suggest that all four species in the genus are  threatened at some level (suggested Red List status ranges from Vulnerable for S.  chinensis and S. sahulensis to Critically Endangered for S. teuszii).",,10.1016/bs.amb.2015.04.001,Animals;Ecosystem;Species Specificity;Population Dynamics;Indian Ocean;Pacific Ocean;Conservation;Animal Distribution;Atlantic Ocean;Dolphins/anatomy & histology/classification/*genetics/*physiology;Endangered Species;General biology;Sousa chinensis;Sousa chinensis taiwanensis;Sousa plumbea;Sousa sahulensis;Sousa teuszii;Status,NA,NA,humpback dolphins a brief introduction to the genus sousa

However, some people in malaria endemic areas  used ITNs for alternative purposes such as fishery and agriculture. It is unclear  why people threatened by malaria misuse ITNs. Here we develop a N-player mosquito  net game, and theoretically show that the misuse of ITNs might be underpinned by  individual and social rationality. In the mosquito net game, each player uses  ITNs for malaria prevention or alternative purposes. The proper ITN use decreases  the probability of malaria infection, while the improper ITN use increases the  player's labor productivity. Each player's expected payoff is influenced by other  players' strategies. We found that the misuse of ITNs can be a Pareto efficient  Nash equilibrium. The maximum number of players using ITNs for malaria prevention  is limited by insecticidal effectiveness of ITNs and extra income from ITN  misuse. Furthermore, we found that players in a low-income community are  attracted to the misuse of ITNs even if the probability of malaria infection is  high. Introduction of a tax on ITN misuse was shown to be effective to motivate  the players to use ITNs for malaria prevention.

Therefore, as a novel approach, this study evaluated the genotoxic potential of Roundup (R) to blood cells of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) following short-term (1 and 3 days) exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations (58 and 116 mu g/l), addressing also the possible association with oxidative stress. Thus, comet and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) assays were adopted, as genotoxic end points, reflecting different types of genetic damage. The pro-oxidant state was assessed through enzymatic (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase) and non-enzymatic (total glutathione content) antioxidants, as well as by lipid peroxidation (LPO) measurements. The Roundup (R) potential to induce DNA strand breaks for both concentrations was demonstrated by the comet assay. The induction of chromosome breakage and/or segregational abnormalities was also demonstrated through the ENA assay, though only after 3-day exposure to both tested concentrations. In addition, the two genotoxic indicators were positively correlated. Antioxidant defences were unresponsive to Roundup (R). LPO levels increased only for the high concentration after the first day of exposure, indicating that oxidative stress caused by this agrochemical in blood was not severe. Overall results suggested that both DNA damaging effects induced by Roundup (R) are not directly related with an increased pro-oxidant state.

Through a series of laboratory experiments, this study investigated the impact of exposure to chemical contaminant such as DDT or copper (Cu), in combination with cold or warm temperature extremes on the marine medaka fish Oryzias melastigma. The results showed that extreme seawater temperatures (i.e., 15 and 32 degrees C in sub-tropical Hong Kong) exacerbated adverse chemical impacts on the growth performance of O. melastigma, in particular at the high thermal extreme. This was likely associated with an interruption of oxygen consumption and aerobic scope. Most importantly, the results of acclimation experiments, as reflected by thermal tolerance polygons, showed that chemical exposure substantially narrowed the thermal tolerance of the medaka, making them more vulnerable to temperature changes and extreme thermal events. Under dual stresses of thermal extremes and chemical exposure, the medaka switched their metabolic pathway to anaerobic respiration that might deplete their energy reserve for chemical detoxification. Although stress proteins such as heat shock proteins (HSP90) were up-regulated for cellular protection in the fish, such a defensive mechanism was repressed with intensifying dual stresses at high temperature and high chemical concentration. Bioconcentration of DDT or Cu generally increased with increasing temperature and its exposure concentration. Overall, these complex chemical-temperature interactions concomitantly exerted a concerted adverse impact to O. melastigma. The temperature-dependent toxicity of DDT or Cu shown in this study clearly demonstrated the potential challenge brought by the risk of chemical pollution under the impact of global climate change.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  44,10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.106226     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Thermal extremes;Metal;Insecticide;Marine medaka;Toxic mechanism;THERMAL TOLERANCE;DICHLORODIPHENYLTRICHLOROETHANES DDTS;SUBLETHAL CONCENTRATIONS;WATERBORNE COPPER;OXYGEN LIMITATION;CADMIUM EXPOSURE;TEMPERATURE;METABOLISM;RESPONSES;STRESS;Military Personnel;Cold Temperature,NA,NA,extreme cold or warm events can potentially exacerbate chemical toxicity to the marine medaka fish <i>oryzias melastigma<i>

Although other non-mammalian vertebrates provide parental care in the form of nutritive secretions for offspring to feed from, the potential for toxicant transfer during non-mammalian parental care is rarely considered. The discus fish, Symphysodon spp., employs an unusual parental care strategy where fry feed on parental epidermal mucus for several weeks after hatching. This strategy has the potential to act as a method of contaminant transfer. In discus adults, both waterborne and dietary toxicants are sequestered and secreted into their epidermal mucus, the food on which fry depend. To determine whether parents could channel these contaminants directly to offspring, we exposed parents to aqueous cadmium (Cd) and recorded the subsequent feeding behaviour and Cd content of fry. Fry continued to feed normally from contaminated mucus and accumulated significant tissue concentrations of Cd. In conclusion, this parental care mechanism of the discus fish can expose offspring to harmful contaminants during the sensitive early stages of life and highlights that parent to offspring contaminant transfer after birth may be more widespread than previously thought.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  34,10.1242/jeb.089102     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),biparental;cadmium;discus;mucus;EARLY-LIFE STAGES;MATERNAL TRANSFER;IN-UTERO;CADMIUM;ORGANOCHLORINES;EXPOSURE;SELENIUM;GROWTH;REPRODUCTION;METABOLISM,NA,NA,a toxic diet transfer of contaminants to offspring through a parental care mechanism

These social signals are important in establishing dominance, which in turn has an impact on an individual's ability to find and use mates, food, and habitat space. In this study, we investigated the impact of exposure to sublethal levels of the herbicide metolachlor on the ability of crayfish to respond to olfactory signals used in agonistic behaviors. Crayfish were exposed to three different environmentally relevant concentrations (60 ppb, 70 ppb, and 80 ppb) of metolachlor for 96 hours. Each exposed crayfish was then placed in a fight arena and was allowed to interact with a naive, untreated crayfish for 15 minutes. We analyzed several characteristics of fighting behavior, including initial aggressiveness, time to fight, intensity levels, duration, number of encounters, and the winner and loser of each fight. Crayfish exposed to 80 ppb metolachlor were less likely to initiate and win encounters against naive conspecifics than any other treatment group. Analysis of fight dynamics shows that metolachlor does not alter the temporal fighting dynamics within crayfish aggression.

Bifenthrin inhibited the fish humoral immune response to bacteria by altering the lymphocyte and neutrophil ratios and decreasing the production of lysozyme, complement component 3, immunoglobulin M, and C-reactive protein, particularly were 1.0 mu g/L. Bifenthrin caused intestinal damage and significantly reduced the volume of intes-tinal mucus at 12 and 36 hours postinjection (hpi) (p < 0.05). Moreover, 1.0 mu g/L bifenthrin significantly increased the fish mortality and bacterial loads at 12 and 36 hpi (p < 0.05). RNA-seq analysis revealed several enriched genes involved in pathogen attachment and recognition, inflammatory responses, and complement system at the early-to-mid stage of infection (4-12 hpi). Overall, our results corroborated that bifenthrin induced immunotoxicity in Gobiocypris rarus, resulting in immune dysfunction of fish and increasing their sensitivity to bacterial infection and accelerating mortality.

Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are environmental contaminants that mimic or alter the process of hormone signaling. In particular, EDCs that alter estrogen and androgen signaling pathways are of major concern for fishes because these EDCs may alter reproductive physiology, behavior, and ultimately sex ratio. Bifenthrin, a pyrethroid with escalating usage, is confirmed to disrupt estrogen signaling in several species of fish, including Menidia beryllina (inland silverside), an Atherinid recently established as a euryhaline model. Our main objective was to broadly assess the molecular and physiological responses of M. beryllina to the ng/L concentrations of bifenthrin typically found in the environment, with a focus on endocrine-related effects, and to discern links between different tiers of the biological hierarchy. As such, we evaluated the response of juvenile Menidia to bifenthrin using a Menidia-specific microarray, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on specific endocrine-related genes of interest, and a Menidia-specific ELISA to the egg-coat protein choriogenin, to evaluate a multitude of molecular-level responses that would inform mechanisms of toxicity and any underlying causes of change at higher biological levels of organization. The sublethal nominal concentrations tested (0.5, 5 and 50 ng/L) were chosen to represent the range of concentrations observed in the environment and to provide coverage of a variety of potential responses. We then employed a 21-day reproductive assay to evaluate reproductive responses to bifenthrin (at 0.5 ng/L) in a separate group of adult M. beryllina. The microarray analysis indicated that bifenthrin influences a diverse suite of molecular pathways, from baseline metabolic processes to carcinogenesis. A more targeted examination of gene expression via qPCR demonstrated that bifenthrin downregulates a number of estrogen-related transcripts, particularly at the lowest exposure level. Choriogenin protein also decreased with exposure to increasing concentrations of bifenthrin, and adult M. beryllina exposed to 0.5 ng/L had significantly reduced reproductive output (fertilized eggs per female). This reduction in fecundity is consistent with observed changes in endocrine-related gene expression and choriogenin production. Taken together, our results demonstrate that environmental concentrations of bifenthrin have potential to interfere with metabolic processes, endocrine signaling, and to decrease reproductive output.

Zebrafish were fed pellets spiked with 0.03, 0.15, or 1.8 mu g/g dieldrin for 21 days. Behavioral analysis revealed no difference in exploratory behaviors or those related to anxiety. Transcriptional networks for T-cell aggregation and selection were decreased in expression suggesting an immunosuppressive effect of dieldrin, consistent with other studies investigating organochlorine pesticides. Processes related to oxidative phosphorylation were also differentially affected by dieldrin. Quantitative proteomics (iTRAQ) using a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap identified 226 proteins that were different following one or more doses. These proteins included ATP synthase subunits (mitochondrial) and hypoxia up-regulated protein 1 which were decreased and NADH dehydrogenases (mitochondrial) and signal recognition particle 9 which were up-regulated. Thus, proteins affected were functionally associated with the mitochondria and a protein network analysis implicated Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease as diseases associated with altered proteins. Molecular networks related to mitochondrial dysfunction and T-cell regulation are hypothesized to underlie the association between dieldrin and PD. These data contribute to a comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic biomarker framework for pesticide exposures and neurodegenerative diseases.        Biological significance: Dieldrin is a persistent organochlorine pesticide that has been associated with human neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease. Dieldrin is ranked 18th on the 2015 U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and continues to be a pesticide of concern for human health. Transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics (ITRAQ) were employed to characterize the molecular networks in the central nervous system that are altered with dietary exposure to dieldrin. We found that transcriptional and protein networks related to the immune system, mitochondria, and Parkinson's disease were preferentially affected by dieldrin. The study provides new insight into the mechanisms of dieldrin neurotoxicity that may explain, in part, the association between this pesticide and increased risks to neurodegeneration. These data contribute in a significant way to developing a molecular framework for pesticide induced neurotoxicity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Olfactory function of juvenile chinook salmon was evaluated in two separate experiments following 2-h immersion exposures to 0, 1, 10, or 100 mu g diazinon/L. In the first test system. groups of 10 salmon were transferred to the prechoice zone of a Y-maze fluviarium with parallel streams of water. A dilute alarm scent composed of either chinook skin extract or L-serine was pumped into the water supply of one arm. Fish were allowed to choose either upstream arm by raising a containment screen for 10 min, then their positions were photographed and the screen lowered. In the second test system the relationship of diazinon exposure to predation susceptibility was directly examined by transferring groups of 20 salmon (10 diazinon-exposed, 10 control) to troughs containing a protective cover. These salmon were given two olfactory warnings by delivering conspecific skin extract to both their transfer container and the predation tank they entered. After a 2-min prey acclimation period, larger predator rainbow trout were allowed access to the downstream section of the tank containing the test salmon. The combined fish were observed until approximately 50% of the prey fish had been consumed. Statistical comparisons indicated that although the salmon did avoid the water streams containing alarm scents. none of the diazinon exposure levels resulted in significantly different outcomes from the controls (alpha = 0.05) in either the two-choice maze study or the predation study.

We previously reported that PCB-exposure induced abnormal schooling behavior in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). This abnormal behavior might be caused by the functional alteration of central or terminal nervous system. To understand the mechanism(s) of behavioral change by PCB-exposure, we analyzed the gene expression profiles in the brain of medaka exposed to 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) or a PCB mixture (Kanechlor-400: KC-400) using a cDNA microarray that we constructed. Twelve FLF-II strain medaka (six individuals per treatment) were dietary exposed to PCB126 (0,01 mu g/g b.w./day) or KC-400 (1 mu g/g b.w./day) for three weeks. For the control, six fish were fed a control diet. After the exposure period, fish were dissected, and the brain samples were collected. The samples from control fish were pooled and used as a common reference in the microarray experiment. Microarray data were normalized by the LOWESS method, and we screened the genes whose expression levels were altered more than 1.5-fold. Gene expression profiling showed 97 down-regulated and 379 up-regulated genes in the brain of medaka exposed to PCB126. KC-400 exposure suppressed 15 genes and induced 266 genes in medaka brain. Among these genes, the expression levels of 7 and 188 genes were commonly down- or up-regulated, respectively in both treatment groups. On the other hand, 31 gene expressions were significantly different between PCB126 and KC-400 treatment groups, and three out of 31 genes were received opposite effects. In addition, the microarray data showed that thyroid hormone-responsive genes were up-regulated by PCB-exposure, which may imply that PCBs or their metabolites mimic thyroid hormone effects in the brain of PCB-exposed medaka.

Dengue infection is a systemic and dynamic disease with a wide clinical spectrum that includes both severe and non-severe manifestations. In some cases dengue can lead to death. Cambodia has one of the highest per-capita incidence rates. Without a cure or routinely available vaccine, dengue control relies largely on reduction and avoidance mosquitoes. In Cambodia dengue mosquito control activities are focused on larviciding with temephos and pyrethroid based adulticide sprays to which Aedes have been shown to be increasingly resistant. The current qualitative study was designed to better understand the community acceptance and perceptions of biological controls that would overcome insecticide resistance for consideration in dengue control strategies for the future. Two control methods were deployed in different size water containers: (1) guppy fish to predate mosquito larvae in large containers, and (2) a slow-release larvicide (pyriproxyfen) product in small containers. A total of 103 people participated in 12 FGDs and nine IDIs. Both methods were generally seen positively. The advantages of guppy fish were their ease of use and rearing, and evident propensity to eat larvae. The advantages of pyriproxyfen was its long-lasting effectiveness, lack of smell, and easy maintenance. Interpersonal communication through health volunteers was the most preferred method of transmitting prevention messages. Both mosquito control interventions should be considered in future projects in Cambodia.        Background In Cambodia dengue vector control activities are focused on larviciding with temephos and pyrethroid based adulticide sprays to which Aedes have been shown to be increasingly resistant. A cluster randomized trial assessed the impact of using biological control tools (guppy fish, pyriproxyfen (PPF), and Communication for Behavioral Impact (COMBI) activities in combination), which would be used in a value comparison to traditional chemical control tools. Given these new intervention methods, a qualitative assessment was designed in order to represent the quality of understanding, acceptance, and implementation by participants. Methodology/Principal findings A total of 103 participants in 12 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and nine In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) were included in the study. The majority of participants in intervention villages (50 out of 80) preferred guppy fish over other vector control methods due to ease of use and rearing, quick reproduction and propensity to eat larvae. A substantial number of participants (11 out of 40) in intervention villages with PPF favored it due to long-lasting effectiveness, lack of smell and easy maintenance. Participants showed high demand for both interventions and were willing to pay between 100-500 riel (0.03-0.13 USD). Nearly all participants perceived that the interventions resulted in a reduction in Aedes mosquitos (both adults and immatures) and dengue cases. The presence of larvae in the water despite the use of PPF was a source of concern for some participants, although this was overcome in some cases with proper health education through health volunteers. Interpersonal communication through health volunteers was the most favorite method of transmitting prevention messages.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  42,10.1371/journal.pntd.0007907     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),WATER STORAGE CONTAINERS;AEDES-AEGYPTI;TEMEPHOS RESISTANCE;LARVIVOROUS FISH;VECTOR CONTROL;PARTICIPATION,NA,NA,implementation of guppy fish <i>poecilia reticulata<i> and a novel larvicide pyriproxyfen product sumilarv 2mr for dengue control in cambodia a qualitative study of acceptability sustainability and community engagement

Reproductive impairment observed in fish by dieldrin is likely the result of multiple effects along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, but the molecular signaling cascades are not well characterized. To better elucidate the mode of action of dieldrin in the hypothalamus, this study measured neurotransmitter levels and examined the transcriptomic response in female largemouth bass (LMB) to an acute treatment of dieldrin. Male and female LMB were injected with either vehicle or 10 mg dieldrin/kg and sacrificed after 7 days. There were no significant changes in dopamine or DOPAC concentrations in the neuroendocrine brain of males and females after treatment but GABA levels in females were moderately increased 20-30% in the hypothalamus and cerebellum. In the female hypothalamus, there were 227 transcripts (p < 0.001) identified as being differentially regulated by dieldrin. Functional enrichment analysis revealed transcription, DNA repair, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and cell communication, as biological processes over-represented in the microarray analysis. Pathway analysis identified DNA damage, inflammation, regeneration, and Alzheimer's disease as major cell processes and diseases affected by dieldrin. Using multiple bioinformatics approaches, this study demonstrates that the teleostean hypothalamus is a target for dieldrin-induced neurotoxicity and provides mechanistic evidence that dieldrin activates similar cell pathways and biological processes that are also associated with the etiology of human neurological disorders.

The glycogen, protein and lactic acid contents, along with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzyme activities in liver and muscle tissues of control and pesticide-exposed fish were estimated. When compared with those of control fish, significant depletion of glycogen content was observed in liver, and that of protein in muscle tissue of fish treated with both the pesticides at their higher as well as lower concentrations. Lactic acid reduction was significant only in fish muscle treated with deltamethrin. SDH level was reduced significantly in both liver and muscle tissues except in fish exposed to 0.0093 mg L-1 permethrin. AST level was reduced significantly in liver and muscle tissues and ALT in muscle tissue of deltamethrin treated fish only.

Nevertheless, concerns have arisen about its harmful side effects for both ecosystems and wildlife health. Therefore, the objective of this work was to assess the effects of a commercial formulation of glyphosate (RoundUp (R) UltraMax), at environmentally relevant concentrations on zebrafish embryos through a set of behavioural patterns. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 1, 2 and 5 mu g a.i. mL(-1) concentrations of the glyphosate formulation for 72 h (from 2.5 to 75 h post-fertilization (hpf)). After exposure, larvae were washed and allowed to develop until 144 hpf. At this point, the larvae behaviour was evaluated using a battery of tests to assess the general exploratory motility, escape-like responses, anxiety-related behaviours and social interactions. In addition, cortisol levels were assessed. No significant changes were observed relative to the exploratory behaviour in the standard open field. The anxiety-related behaviours were similar among groups, and no social interference was observed following exposure to these glyphosate concentrations. Likewise, cortisol levels remained similar among treatments. Still, the larvae exposed to 5 mu g a.i. mL(-1) did not react to the presence of an aversive stimulus, supporting glyphosate-induced changes in the sensory- motor coordination during development. In general, these results indicate a possible neurotoxic effect of this glyphosate-based formulation that should be further evaluated. In addition, the results obtained could impose a risk for wildlife sensitive species that should not be neglected. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Mortality of arthropod natural enemies resulting from the application of herbicides is negligible. But nothing is known how herbicides affect the behaviour of natural enemies and thus alter their pest control efficacy. Aim of the study was to assess the effect of the Roundup residues on the predatory, defensive, locomotory and reproductive behaviour of epigeic spiders and carabid beetles. Specimens of Pardosa agricola (Araneae: Lycosidae) and Poecilus cupreus (Coleoptera: Carabidae) were exposed for 2 h to the fresh and 1-day old residues of Roundup Biaktiv (Monsanto, IPA 480 g/l). Predation rate was similar for all treatments in both spiders and beetles. Spiders did not avoid surface treated with herbicide residues more than the control surface, but beetles slightly avoided surface with fresh residues. The speed of locomotion of spiders was not altered by herbicide residues, but beetles exposed to residues crawled at significantly lower speed than the control group. Herbicide residues did not affect the escape efficacy of spiders from a predator. Residues had no detrimental effect on the courtship, mating frequency and duration in spiders. Roundup Bioaktiv thus appears to be harmless to lycosid spiders and only slightly harmful to carabid beetles. The biological control potential of both predators should not be reduced by the application of Roundup Bioaktiv. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

On the contrary, the innate response appeared not enough to resolve the Phdp infection, which was characterized by tissue damage, bacterial widespread and substantial detection of specific humoral immunity in surviving fish, also associated to lymphocytes clonal expansion. Besides the opportunistic conditions involved in fish vibriosis and pasteurellosis, the comparison between these experimental infection models seems to suggest that the rate of development of the acquired immunity is strictly linked to the activation of the host innate response combined to the degree of bacterial virulence.

Drosophilids have been utilized previously as an effective tool in toxicological tests. In the present study, the effects of a glyphosate-based herbicide (Roundup [Original]) were investigated regarding oxidative stress, the antioxidant defence system and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in Drosophila melanogaster. Flies (of both genders) that were 1 to 3 days old were exposed to different glyphosate concentrations (0.0 mg/L = control, 1.0 mg/L, 2.0 mg/L, 5.0 mg/L and 10.0 mg/L) in the diet for 24 h and 96 h. After the exposure periods, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were quantified. In addition, the mRNA expression of antioxidant genes (i.e., keap1, sod, sod2, cat, irc, gclc, gclm, gss, trxt, trxr-1 and trxr-2) was evaluated via RT-PCR. Additionally, AChE activity was evaluated only after the 96 h exposure period. The results indicated that Roundup exposure leads to a reduction in ROS levels in flies exposed for 96 h. ACAP levels and gene expression of the antioxidant defence system exhibited an increase from 24 h, while LPO did not show any significant alterations in both exposure periods. AChE activity was not affected following Roundup exposure.

While the dysbiosis can be attributed to glyphosate's antimicrobial properties, the observed effects on neurotransmitter levels leading to the reported induction of oxidative stress in the brain indicate a novel and significant mode of action for glyphosate, namely the impairment of the microbiome-gut-axis.

A dike was constructed in 1995 to replace the function of the eroded barrier beach, but it contained a water-control structure to allow managed hydrologic connection to the lake. The control structure contained a fish passageway to allow movement of fish across the dike, while restricting entry of large common carp. Color-infrared aerial photos from project start in 1994 through 2010 (and 2022) were analyzed to track vegetation changes, and major vegetation types were sampled quantitatively. Drawdown of water levels in 1996 after dike construction elicited a response of mudflat species from the seed bank, as well as tree seedlings. Over half of the marsh was vegetated then and in subsequent years. The water-control structure was opened in 1998, and by 2000, invasive Phragmites australis had gained dominance. Most trees were eventually eliminated by herbicide treatment and flooding, and extent of Phragmites was reduced by management actions. Typha spp. and emergents Sagittaria latifolia and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani became dominant by 2022.

While many previous studies have been performed on the interactions between the gut microbiome and the host in mammals, studies in fish are still lacking. In this study, we investigated changes in the intestinal microbiome and pathogen susceptibility of zebrafish (Danio rerio) following chronic antibiotics exposure. The chronic antibiotics exposure assay was performed on zebrafish for 30 days using oxytetracycline (Otc), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Smx/Tmp), or erythromycin (Ery), which are antibiotics widely used in the aquaculture industry. The microbiome analysis indicated that Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in the gut microbiome of the zebrafish used in this study. However, in Smx/Tmp-treated zebrafish, the compositions of Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria were changed significantly, and in Ery-treated zebrafish, the compositions of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were altered significantly. Although alpha diversity analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the richness, beta diversity analysis revealed a community imbalance in the gut microbiome of all chronically antibiotics-exposed zebrafish. Intriguingly, in zebrafish with dysbiosis in the gut microbiome, the pathogen susceptibility to Edwardsiella piscicida, a representative Gram-negative fish pathogen, was reduced. Gut microbiome imbalance resulted in a higher count of goblet cells in intestinal tissue and an upregulation of genes related to the intestinal mucosal barrier. In addition, as innate immunity was enhanced by the increased mucosal barrier, immune and stress-related gene expression in the intestinal tissue was downregulated. In this study, we provide new insight into the effect of gut microbiome dysbiosis on pathogen susceptibility. © 2024 by the authors.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: K.H.

Neonicotinoids are a class of water-soluble systemic insecticides that have become a major concern in aquatic systems. In this study, we explored how a 10-day exposure to various concentrations (0, 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 μg/L) of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid affects the learned recognition of predator odour by non-target damselfly larvae (Lestes spp). Unexposed larvae and those exposed to the low concentration (0.1 μg/L) demonstrated an appropriate learned response to a novel predator odour following a conditioning with the odour paired with chemical alarm cues. However, such learning failed to occur for larvae that were exposed to imidacloprid concentrations of 1.0 and 10.0 μg/L. Thus, either the cognitive processing of the chemical information was impaired or the chemistry of one or both of the conditioning cues was altered, making them ineffective for learning. In a second experiment, we found evidence for this latter hypothesis. In the absence of background imidacloprid exposure, larvae did not show significant learned responses to the predator odour when the conditioning cues were mixed with imidacloprid (initial pulse solution of 3.0 μg/L) at the start of conditioning (reaching a final concentration of 0.01 μg/L). These findings indicate that even low levels of imidacloprid can have important implications for chemosensory cognition of non-target species in aquatic environments. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: A.L.

In this work, a NTR probe (ZJ) was constructed on the structure of pyrimidine derivatives with 4-animobenzyl carbamate groups. ZJ exhibited a responsive “turn-on” two-photon excited fluorescence by NTR recognition in cells and in vivo. The 4-nitrobenzyl carbamate groups in ZJ could be reduced by NTR to 4-animobenzyl carbamate groups in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Attributed to its self-immolation property, 4-animobenzyl carbamate would release to generate primary amine on pyrimidine, accompanied by fluorescence signal recovery of ZJ. Such responsive fluorescence turn-on process accomplished as fast as within 20 mins. The favorable stability and specificity of ZJ on NTR activity sensing was further illustrated according to the negligible interference by biological factors and the distinguishing on different NTR types.

The exposed females were mated with unexposed males to produce embryos (F1). The F1 generation were cultured (4–120 hours post-fertilization, hpf) with and without 1 mmol/L FA. The neurotoxic effects of early-life TBT exposure for zebrafish and their offspring (F1) were significantly enhanced anxiety and reduced aggression, decreased gene expression of DNA methyltransferase in the brain and increased serotonin levels in the body. Moreover, the intergenerational neurodevelopmental toxicity, as manifested in the F1 generation, was attenuated by FA supplementation. In summary, early-life TBT exposure led to intergenerational neurodevelopmental deficits in zebrafish, and DNA methyl donors had a protective effect on F1 neurodevelopment, which can inform the prevention and treatment of intergenerational neurotoxicity due to organotin pollutants. © 2023","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: Z.

Monitoring individual and collective behaviours produces large amounts of non-linear data that require tailor-suited computational methods to interpret and manage the information. Fractal dimension (FD) and entropy are two groups of such non-linear analysing methods that serve as indicators of the complexity (FD) and predictability (entropy) of the behaviours. Since behavioural complexity and predictability may be modulated by contaminants, the changes in its FD and entropy values have a clear potential to be embedded in a biological early warning system (BEWS), which may be particularly useful in Precision Fish Farming settings and to monitor wild populations. This work presents a review of the effects of a wide range of environmental contaminants, including toxic compounds, cleaning and disinfecting agents, stimulant (caffeine), anaesthetics and antibiotics, heavy metals (lead, cupper, and mercury), selenium, pesticides and persistent environmental pollutants, on the FD and entropy values of collective and individual behavioural responses of different fish species. All the revised studies demonstrate the usefulness of both FD and entropy to indicate the presence of pollutants and underline the need to consider early changes in the trend of the evolution of their values prior to them becoming significantly different from the control values, i.e., while it is still possible to identify the contaminant and preserve the health and integrity of the fish. © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: H.

In this study, common carp were treatment with FEN at 0.45 and 1.35 μg/L for 14 d, and the toxic effects and underlying mechanisms of FEN on the intestine of carp were revealed. RNA-seq results showed that FEN exposure cause a wide range of transcriptional alterations in the intestine and the differentially expressed genes were mainly enrichment in the pathways related to immune and metabolism. Specifically, FEN exposure induced pathological damage and altered submicroscopic structure of the intestine, elevated the levels of Bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin, altered the contents of claudin-1, occludin, and zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1), and causing injury to the intestinal barrier. In addition, inflammation-related index TNF-α in the serum and IL-6 in the intestinal tissues were generally increased after FEN exposure. Moreover, FEN exposure promoted an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), altered the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH), upregulated the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the intestines. The apoptosis-related parameter cytochrome c, caspase-9, and caspase-3 were significantly altered, indicating that inflammation reaction, oxidative stress, and apoptosis may be involved in the toxic mechanism of FEN on carp. Moreover, FEN treatment also altered the intestinal flora community significantly, which may affect the intestinal normal physiological function and thus affect the growth of fish.

The experimental results evidence a better removal performance for the aluminum than the carbon steel, and stationary removal conditions were reached at 40 min with a removal efficiency > 40% considering an input flow of 2 L min−1 and operational cost of 0.172 USD m−3 at 7.5 mA cm−2. The XRD analysis evidenced the interaction between the aluminum ion and the pesticide. The residual aluminum in the supernatant was < 10 mg L−1 at stationary removal conditions. The species distribution inside the reactor is described by the theoretical analysis, which takes into account the simultaneous solution of the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and kinetic-based mass conservation equation. Under full electrokinetic control (secondary current distribution), the electrode kinetics characterizing the flux generation of Al3+ on the anode is also taken into consideration.

We then used the tracking and heat maps of the behavior trajectories of zebrafish subjected to sham and imidacloprid exposure and compared their social behavior. Furthermore, histomorphology and immunohistochemistry of their brain tissue sections were performed to clarify possible neurotoxicity due to imidacloprid exposure in our adult zebrafish.

These residues recruit Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) that we show here to be required for endosomal IFITM activity. We identify PIP3 as an interferon-inducible phospholipid that acts as a rheostat for endosomal antiviral immunity. PIP3 levels correlated with the potency of endosomal IFITM restriction and exogenous PIP3 enhanced inhibition of endocytic viruses, including the recent SARS-CoV2 Omicron variant. Together, our results identify PIP3 as a critical regulator of endosomal IFITM restriction linking it to the Pi3K/Akt/mTORC pathway and elucidate cell-compartment-specific antiviral mechanisms with potential relevance for the development of broadly acting antiviral strategies. © 2023 The Authors.

It has been hypothesised that these population declines during the 1950s–1970s were largely driven by a combination of reproductive failure due to eggshell-thinning, egg breakage and embryonic death attributable to DDT and its metabolites, and to enhanced mortality attributable to the more toxic cyclodiene compounds such as aldrin and dieldrin. Using 75 years (1946–2021) of Peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) monitoring data (315 unique nest-sites monitored for 6110 nest-years), we studied the breeding performance of a resident Peregrine population in southern Scotland relative to the spatiotemporal pattern of organochlorine pesticide use. We show that (i) Peregrine breeding success and measures of breeding performance increased substantially following the reduction in, and subsequently a complete ban on, the use of organochlorine pesticides; (ii) improvements in Peregrine breeding performance were more dramatic in southeastern Scotland where agriculture was the predominant land use than in southwestern Scotland where there was less arable and more forested land; (iii) Peregrines nesting closer to the coast generally had higher fledging success (that is, a higher proportion of clutches that produced at least one fledgeling) than those nesting inland farther away from the coast; (iv) low temperatures and excessive rain in May negatively affected Peregrine fledging success; and (v) Peregrine abundance increased in parallel with improvements in reproductive performance following the reduction and then complete ban on the use of organochlorine pesticides in the UK. However, recovery was gradual and occurred over four decades, and rate of recovery varied among measures of reproductive performance (egg, nestling and fledgeling production). Our results suggest that the temporal pattern of organochlorine pesticide use strongly influenced Peregrine reproductive parameters but that the pattern of influence differed regionally. Overall results are consistent with the hypothesis that reproductive failure caused by organochlorine pesticides was an important driver of the decline in the south Scottish Peregrine population, and that improvements in all measures of breeding performance following a reduction and eventual ban on organochlorine use facilitated the observed increase in this population. © 2023 The Authors.

After exposure of fertilized eggs to FBZ for 72 h (h), the larvae were cultured to adulthood in clean water. In adult zebrafish embryonically exposed to 50 and 500 ng L−1 FBZ, the ratio of brain weight/body weight was significantly decreased, and the number of apoptotic cells in the brain was significantly increased, accompanied by upregulated protein levels of P53 and downregulated levels of BCL2. The novel tank test showed a significant reduction in the moved distance and speed, and a longer period of adaptation to new environments in the 500 ng L−1 group. The social preference experiment showed impaired social interaction behaviour and reduced time of aggregation in the 500 ng L−1 group. Increased dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain might be responsible for this anxiety-like behaviour. In addition to upregulated protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and β2-adrenoceptor, the transcription of genes related to dopamine and norepinephrine synthesis in the brain such as th1, th2, ddc, drd1b, dat, and dbh, was increased. The methylation levels of related genes were reduced, which were matched with their increased transcriptional levels. These results demonstrate that embryonic FBZ exposure might cause persistent neurotoxicity in adulthood, which suggests the rational cautious use of FBZ. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: C.

However, the characterization and classification of GIs are challenging due to their relatively small size and considerable genetic diversity. Predicting their intercellular mobility is of utmost importance in the context of the emerging crisis of multidrug resistance. Here, we propose a large-scale classification method to categorize GIs according to their mobility profile and, subsequently, analyze their gene cargo. We based our classification decision scheme on a collection of mobility protein motif definitions available in publicly accessible databases. Our results show that the size distribution of GI classes correlates with their respective structure and complexity. Self-transmissible GIs are usually the largest, except in Bacillota and Actinomycetota, accumulate antibiotic and phage resistance genes, and favour the use of a tyrosine recombinase to insert into a host's replicon. Non-mobilizable GIs tend to use a DDE transposase instead. Finally, although tRNA genes are more frequently targeted as insertion sites by GIs encoding a tyrosine recombinase, most GIs insert in a protein-encoding gene. This study is a stepping stone toward a better characterization of mobile GIs in bacterial genomes and their mechanism of mobility. © 2023 The Author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: P.-E.

Unfortunately, abuse of pesticide application by vegetable growers in Uganda increases risks of pesticide residue exposure among consumers, as they may be above Maximum Residue Limits (European Union Maximum Residue Limits used as a standard in Uganda). This study aimed to determine consumer attitudes and risk perceptions towards pesticide-stained tomatoes in Uganda to support interventions that could be used to reduce pesticide residue exposures in food. Methods A mixed methods cross-sectional study sampled 468 household consumers in four regions of Uganda, selecting one district (interventional project area) per region. In each district, about 60 household members were randomly selected from a total of three Sub Counties and interviewed. In addition, 9 tomato handlers (three tomato farmers, three tomato retailers, and three tomato wholesalers) participated in Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) per district. Collected data were entered into MS-Excel 13 and exported into Stata version 14.0 for cleaning and analysis at a 5% level of significance and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). The proportion of risk perceptions and attitudes were computed and presented as percentages, while factors associated with risk perception were determined using Fisher exact test. Qualitative data collected under a traditional theory were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results More than half, 54.2% (253/468), of the respondents were females, mean age was 37 years (SD = 13.13, ranging from 18 to 88 years). Half of the respondents, 50.9% (238/467), were farmers by occupation, and 40.3% (188/468) had completed upper primary education. Only 5.0% (20/396) of consumers reported a high-risk perception towards tomatoes stained with pesticide residues, the rest, 95.0% (376/396), were buying pesticide-stained tomatoes despite their awareness of the possible health effects. The main reason for buying the pesticide-stained tomatoes was that a majority, 59.0% (230/390), lacked an alternative to stained tomatoes like organically grown tomatoes. However, consumers generally had a negative attitude towards pesticide-stained tomatoes, with 67.0% (313/468) of the consumers disagreeing with the statement that tomatoes sold on the market are safe. Consumer risk perception was significantly associated with their awareness about residues in the tomatoes; where the proportion of consumers who were aware of the risk of pesticide-stained tomatoes was 42.8 times more likely not to buy stained tomatoes compared to the proportion of those who were not aware. OR, 42.8 (95% CI: 10.76–170.28). However, after Fisher-Exact tests analysis, level of education P(0.975), gender P(0.581), and age group P (0.680) were not associated with consumer risk perception (95% CI and 5% level of significance). Conclusion Although the consumers had a negative attitude towards the pesticide-stained tomatoes, their risk perception towards them ranked low, with most consumers buying tomatoes stained with pesticide residues due to a lack of an alternative. Ministry of Agriculture extension service efforts should promote and emphasize community to start household-based organic kitchen gardens as the efforts for the establishment of a national pesticide residue monitoring center awaits. © 2023 Sekabojja et al.

Run-off problems, poor wettability, limited effectiveness, and high dosages are the main drawbacks of its current formulations, which negatively affect consumers, pollinators, and the environment. In response to all of these issues, a powerful and environmentally safe imidacloprid nanosuspension (NS) formulation is made using liquid engineering and the biosynergistic pepper oleoresin. The effects of surfactant types, concentration, sheer mixing speed, duration on particle size, and polydispersity index were thoroughly investigated using Zetasizer and scanning electron microscopy. Quality indicators including zeta potential (−36 mV), viscosity, and particle size (30 nm) were successfully modified using CIPAC principles. Oleoresin increases the viscosity while lowering the sedimentation velocity, giving the NS stability for long-term storage. On cotton whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci), the NS has shown superior effectiveness (92%), which may be attributed to its improved (30%) retention and penetration as well as a lower contact angle (37.10). GC-MS analysis found terpene-rich bioactive compounds such as limonene and caryophyllene that may have improved the insecticidal effects of imidacloprid. The NS is less detrimental (69%) to natural defenses, has minor acute toxicity to fish (LC50 = 136.3 mg L-1), and exhibits low phytotoxicity. The NS reduced the detrimental effects on seed germination and growth. HPLC estimates that the reduced deposits (0.06 mg kg-1) on flowers make the NS 3.5 times less harmful for pollinators and more advantageous for soil microbes. Since the residual level in the NS-treated cotton seed oil was below the maximum residue limit (0.01 mg kg-1), the oil was determined to be safe for human consumption. Scientific validation of the production of a similar toxin in stable, effective, and safe agricultural nanoforms may increase its efficacy even at lower doses, safeguarding human and environmental health and fostering sustainable growth of green plant protection. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: D.K.

Short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) were listed under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in 2017. Further, in 2021, medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs) were proposed to be listed as POPs. We investigated SCCP and MCCP amounts and homolog profiles in four wild fish species from Bahía Blanca Estuary, a South Atlantic Ocean coastal habitat in Argentina. SCCPs and MCCPs were detected in 41% and 36% of the samples, respectively. SCCP amounts ranged from <12 to 29 ng g−1 wet weight and <750–5887 ng g−1 lipid weight, whereas MCCP amounts ranged from <7 to 19 ng g−1 wet weight and <440–2848 ng g−1 lipid weight. Amounts were equivalent to those found in fish from the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans and from some North American and Tibetan Plateau lakes. We performed a human health risk assessment and found no direct risks to human health for SCCP or MCCP ingestion, according to present knowledge. Regarding their environmental behavior, no significant differences were observed among SCCP amounts, sampling locations, species, sizes, lipid content, and age of the specimens. However, there were significant differences in MCCP amounts across species, which could be attributed to fish size and feeding habits.

In summer 2018 and winter 2019, we sampled crustaceans for chemical contaminants and anthropogenic debris and throughout the year surveyed people harvesting from three public fishing piers around San Diego Bay. Of the emerging contaminants found, pyrethroids, benzylbutyl phthalate, PFOS and anthropogenic debris were in differing concentrations in the muscle and viscera of the California spiny lobster and two species of crabs. Combined with previous metal and organic contaminant data from the lobster, 22 contaminants were detected with 5 exceeding consumption thresholds and 8 lacking defined thresholds. California spiny lobster was the main crustacean harvested from piers, attracting shellfishers from a range of ages, incomes, home locations and self-identified racial/ethnic groups. Consumption preferences (e.g., muscle or viscera) were non-discriminant, making lobster contamination a community-wide risk. More monitoring of emerging contaminants and different shellfish species (and tissues) of interest is recommended to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of health risks, especially because the use of bivalves as sentinels may not reveal the same risks (e.g., PFAS, phosphate flame retardants). © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: T.S.

There is an urgent need for strategies to monitor and analyze the coexistence of PFASs and PCNs, especially in food samples at trace levels, to ensure food safety. Herein, a novel β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) derived fluoro-functionalized covalent triazine-based frameworks named CD-F-CTF was firstly synthesized. This innovative framework effectively combines the porous nature of the covalent organic framework and the host-guest recognition property of β-CD enabling the simultaneous extraction of PFASs and PCNs. Under the optimal conditions, a simple and rapid method was developed to analyze PFASs and PCNs by solid-phase extraction (SPE) based simultaneous extraction and stepwise elution (SESE) strategy for the first time. When coupled with liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC−MS/MS) and gas chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (GC−MS/MS), this method achieved impressive detection limits for PFASs (0.020 −0.023 ng/g) and PCNs (0.016 −0.075 ng/g). Furthermore, the excellent performance was validated in food samples with recoveries of 76.7–107 % (for PFASs) and 78.0–108 % (for PCNs).

Herein, we have proposed a photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor based on two-dimensional (2D)/3D organic–inorganic heterojunction for the efficient detection of Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium). The heterojunction was established via the in situ growth of copper (II) selenide (CuSe) nanosheets around the photoactive triazine covalent-organic polymer (COP) nanospheres, which was synthesized using 2,4,6-Tris(4-aminophenyl)-1,3,5-Triazine (TAPT) and 2,4,6-trihydroxy-1,3,5-benzenetricarbaldehyde (Tp) as building blocks (denoted as TAPT-Tp-COP@CuSe). Integrating the features of TAPT-Tp-COP (such as large specific surface and pore size, multi-functionality, and rich defects) and CuSe (such as high photoabsorption ability, fast electron transfer and effective separation of the photo-generated charge carrier) not only can accelerate the photoelectric transformation efficiency, but also can promote the aptamer immobilization. Consequently, the constructed PEC aptasensor based on TAPT-Tp-COP@CuSe illustrated a low detection limit of 3.4 CFU mL−1 with a linear range from 1 × 101 to 1 × 105 CFU mL−1 toward S. typhimurium. In addition, it demonstrated high selectivity in light of the specific recognition of aptamer toward S. typhimurium, good reproducibility and stability, and promising regeneration ability, as well as wide applications for the detection of S. typhimurium in diverse foodstuffs systems. The present work provides a new aptasensing strategy for the effective detection of foodborne pathogens from diverse foodstuffs by combining the merits of COPs and PEC technique. © 2023","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: M.

Externalities of pesticides are associated with social and environmental costs. However, there is still a lack of a systematic method for evaluating and internalizing the externalities of pesticides. This study utilizes the pesticide’s environmental impact quotient and environmental accounting methods to assess the external costs associated with pesticide usage in the winter-wheat–summer-maize cropping system in China’s northern plains, with a specific focus on the pesticide use in Botou City during the year 2020 as a case study. Additionally, we introduce the concept of the net external value of pesticides and propose a methodology for its internalization, aiming to quantify the external costs induced by pesticide usage and explore the possibility of integrating them into market transactions. The results showed that the total external costs of pesticide use are 423.9 USD ha−1, with a positive external value of 171.9 USD ha−1 and a net external value of −252.0 USD ha−1. The negative external costs associated with pesticide use outweigh the positive external values. External costs varied significantly according to environmental receptors, after retaining two significant figures: applicators accounted for 45% of the total external costs, followed by pickers (32%), consumers (11%), groundwater (4.5%), fish (3.9%), beneficial insects (1.7%), birds (1.3%), and bees (1.1%). The external costs of maize cultivation were 33% higher than those of wheat cultivation. The application of herbicides resulted in the highest external costs compared with fungicides and insecticides. Based on the internalization of the results, imposing an ecological tax on pesticide users is recommended, with rates of 3.29% for wheat and 6.76% for maize.

At present, very little is known about the effects of azoxystrobin on courtship and aggressive behavior and the potential underlying mechanisms. In the present study, after exposing adult male and female zebrafish to worst-case scenario concentrations of azoxystrobin (0, 2 μg/L, 20 μg/L, and 200 μg/L) for 42 d, we observed a decrease in courtship behavior and an increase in aggressive behavior in both male and female zebrafish. In addition, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the behavioral effects of azoxystrobin, we quantified the changes in the concentrations of kisspeptin, 5-HT, GnIH, and their corresponding receptor mRNA expression in the brain. The results showed that 200 μg/L azoxystrobin decreased the concentrations of kisspeptin and increased the concentration of GnIH in both male and female zebrafish brain. In addition, azoxystrobin also significantly reduced 5-HT concentration in female zebrafish brain. Further investigation revealed that altered courtship and aggressive behavior were associated with the expression levels of genes (kiss1, kiss2, gnrh3, gnrhr3, 5ht1a, and 5ht2a) involved in kisspeptin-GnIH signaling pathway. In conclusion, our study suggested that azoxystrobin may impair courtship and aggressive behavior in zebrafish by interfering with the kisspeptin-GnIH signaling pathway, which may have more profound effects on natural zebrafish populations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: L.

These chemicals are highly toxic causing elevated cholesterol, immune suppression, reproductive failure, cancer and neuro-endocrine disruption in humans and wildlife being a significant threat to biodiversity and human health. The main reason for the submitted proposal is recent findings of significant flaws in the transition to PFAS replacements that is leading to a widespread pollution. Denmark was the first country banning PFAS, and now other EU countries support the restrictions of these carcinogenic, endocrine disruptive and immunotoxic chemicals. The proposed plan is among the most extensive received by the ECHA for 50 years. Denmark is now the first EU country to initiate the establishment of groundwater parks to try and protect its drinking water. These parks are areas free of agricultural activities and nutritious sewage sludge to secure drinking water free of xenobiotic including PFAS. The PFAS pollution also reflects the lack of comprehensive spatial and temporal environmental monitoring programs in the EU. Such monitoring programs should include key indicator species across ecosystems of livestock, fish and wildlife, to facilitate detection of early ecological warning signals and sustain public health. Simultaneously with inferring a total PFAS ban, the EU should also push for more persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) PFAS substances to be listed on the Stockholm Convention (SC) Annex A such as PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) that is currently listed on the SCs Annex B.

This study aims to investigate whether exposure to environmental levels of azoxystrobin (2 μg/L, 20 μg/L, and 200 μg/L) changes the behavior of male adult zebrafish. Herein, we evaluated behavioral response (locomotor, anxiety-like, and exploratory behaviors), histopathology, biochemical indicators, and gene expression in male adult zebrafish upon azoxystrobin exposure. The study showed that exposure to azoxystrobin for 42 days remarkably increased the locomotor ability of male zebrafish, resulted in anxiety-like behavior, and inhibited exploratory behavior. After treatment with 200 μg/L azoxystrobin, vasodilatation, and congestion were observed in male zebrafish brains. Exposure to 200 μg/L azoxystrobin notably elevated ROS level, MDA concentration, CAT activity, and AChE activity, while inhibiting SOD activity, GPx activity, ACh concentration, and DA concentration in male zebrafish brains.

The residual amount of triazophos detected in natural water may pose a potential threat to non-target aquatic organisms. This paper aims to investigate the toxic effect of triazophos on zebrafish. In this study, 3-month-old female zebrafish (Danio rerio) were continuously exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of triazophos (10 μg/L) for 21d. Subsequently, natural spawning and fertilization were performed using healthy males, and the toxicity of triazophos on both the parental females and their offspring was assessed. The assessment included measurements of female fertility, oxidative stress in parent and offspring, as well as indicators of embryonic development in the offspring. The main results were as follows: after exposure to 10 μg/L triazophosphos, the spawning capacity of parental female fish increased significantly (P<0.05), moreover, it caused a significantly decrease in the activity of liver acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (P<0.05), an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content (P<0.05), and a significant enhancement in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and carboxylesterase (CarE) (P<0.05). The embryo fertilization rate, fertilized egg diameter, embryo heart rate and body length of newly hatched larvae were significantly lower (P<0.05), while the malformation rate of larval fish was significantly higher (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the hatching rate (P>0.05). The activity of AChE and SOD in larvae decreased although not significant (P>0.05), whereas the MDA content increased significantly (P<0.05). Furthermore, the activities of GPx and GST were significantly decreased (P<0.05), while CarE activity was significantly increased (P<0.05). The above findings suggest that exposure to environmental concentrations of triazophos can increase female zebrafish's fecundity, cause oxidative stress in the parenta and their offspring, and adversely affect the developmental process of the offspring embryos. ©The Author(s) 2024.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: D.-M.

One exception involves the Dippers Cinclus spp., a genus of five passerines adapted uniquely to swim and dive in rivers on five continents to feed on aquatic invertebrates and small fishes. Here, we review the effectiveness of Dippers as pollution indicators while identifying further opportunities, caveats and uncertainties that are transferable to other indicator organisms. Dippers have been used as biodindicators i) through relationships linking their distribution, breeding performance and behaviour to river pollution through effects on prey quality and quantity; ii) where contaminants occur in their eggs, tissues, faeces or regurgitates, notably metals (Hg, Se), persistent pollutants (e.g. PCBs, PBDEs, DDE, HEOD) and microplastics. Most data are from C. cinclus in Europe and C. mexicanus in North America. While some pollution effects on Dipper distribution or fitness are well-evidenced, particularly acidification, the resulting impairments are not sufficient to diagnose the source of impact without additional data on water quality or prey abundance. Dippers in these cases provide a general rather than definitive indication of pollution. For contaminants, Dippers have revealed the distribution of specific pollutants at scales ranging from point-sources and regions to different continents. Influences of land use, trophic pathways, diet-shifts, contaminant transport, intergenerational transfer and trends through time have all been identified and supported by detailed knowledge of prey use, territoriality, dispersal, migration, life history, isotopic signatures and energetics. We suggest opportunities to expand the role of Dippers as bioindicators into other locations (Asia and South America), other influences on water quality (e.g. agriculture, wastewater), other contaminants (e.g. PFAs, pharmaceuticals) and through developments in modern biology such as ‘omics. Initial data also show that Dippers could integrate the effects on rivers of habitat modification, flow modification and climate change by indicating effects both directly and through interactions with other multiple stressors. This group of birds illustrates how fundamental ecological information aids the development of bioindicators but reveals the importance of using complementary environmental data when diagnosing bioindicator response. We suggest these are important lessons for ecological indicators more generally. © 2023 The Author(s)","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: M.Á.

Meanwhile, macrophages, neutrophils and Thymic T cells are an important component of the immune system. We studied the immunotoxicity of Spinosad using zebrafish and THP-1 cells. In vivo, Spinosad (0–20 μM) did not cause developmental toxicity in zebrafish, but induced damage to immune cells. In vitro, Spinosad (0–20 μM) inhibited THP-1 cells viability and induced mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress production. In further studies, it impaired phagocytosis of THP-1 cells and interfered with lipid metabolism. In addition, we found that Spinosad can promote the formation of the inflammatory body NLRP3 (NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3) and activate the NF-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway.

This study characterizes a periplasmic superoxide dismutase (SOD) and a cytoplasmic catalase in P. damselae. Purification and partial amino-terminal sequencing confirmed the SOD to be iron-cofactored, with a high degree of homology to other bacterial FeSODs. The SOD was common to all strains analysed in terms of type, location and activity, whilst the catalase varied in activity between strains. The catalase was constitutively expressed, but the SOD appeared to be repressed under low oxygen conditions. In spite of the presence of a periplasmic SOD, P. damselae was susceptible to killing by exogenous superoxide anion generated in a cell-free system. Addition of exogenous SOD to this system did not abolish the bactericidal effect; however, addition of catalase was protective.

CO2 is the most commonly used supercritical fluid due to its no flammability, no toxicity, is non corrosive and presents low critical point characteristics, besides it has been regarded as GRAS (generally recognised as safe) by the USFDA.        All the social and legal tendencies allow us to present this technology as an extraordinary tool for the revalorization of agrofood by-products obtaining high added value raw materials for different productive cycles. Some of the most outstanding examples can be the extraction and fractionation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from fish oil, obtaining of aromatic extracts and essential oils from different natural sources as orange peels, or the production of natural antioxidants from plants and vegetable by-products. All these products have a great market in pharmaceutical and cosmetic sector.        On the other hand, SFE can also be used for the recovery of contaminated soils and detoxification of hazardous wastes. Among the different contaminants capable of being removed from different matrix. are the PAHs, PCB's and organoclorinated pesticides. Some of these applications, as detoxification of industrial waste waters, or treatment of petrol refinery wastes are implanted at industrial levels in some countries like USA.

Although commercial aquaculture has contributed positively to the economies of many producing countries, there are considerable negative environmental and social impacts. In intensive and semi-intensive systems, artificial feeds supplemented with antibiotics are used to prevent the spread of disease and to improve feed conversion ratios. Current knowledge of the health and environmental impact of antibiotics used in aquaculture is poor, particularly in tropical regions. Residues may remain in fish used for human consumption and antibiotics released into the environment can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the food chain. The accumulation of waste feeds in ponds stimulates the growth of bacteria, including human pathogens, which can contaminate products and lead to foodborne disease and the rejection of products in export markets, In extensive systems, where fish are produced mainly for the domestic market, different food safety concerns exist. The consumption of aquatic plants and raw or partially cooked freshwater fish has been associated with foodborne trematode infections, These are a major public health problem in East and South East Asia and occur when products that are contaminated by the infective stages of the parasites are consumed. This paper reviews food safety hazards associated with products from aquaculture and proposes the application of principles of the hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) system as a general strategy to control the hazards identified.

Res.,34,1,221-226,"GALLAGHER, EP and DIGIULIO, RT",,English,,,"Maintenance of the glutathione (GSH) pathway is critical in guarding against the toxic effects of a variety of pollutants. However, despite their importance as an initial line of defense against waterborne toxicants, little is known regarding the role of fish gills in GSH-mediated xenobiotic metabolism. In these studies, the role of channel catfish gills in the detoxification of 2,4,5,6-tetrachloroisophthalonitrile (chlorothalonil), an electrophilic fungicide, was examined Chlorothalonil was metabolized in vitro by gill cytosolic and microsomal glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Chlorothalonil metabolism by cytosolic fractions was reduced markedly when GSH was omitted from reaction mixtures. Microsomal metabolism of chlorothalonil did not occur in the absence of GSH and in the presence of an NA DPH-regenerating system lacking GSH. Channel catfish exposed in vivo to chlorothalonil had increased gill GSH and cysteine concentrations after 72 h exposure, and increased gill gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) activity at 144 h of exposure. Our results show that the gills play an important role in the metabolism and detoxification of chlorothalonil in the channel catfish. Catfish can maintain elevated gill GSH concentrations in the presence of chlorothalonil by increasing gill cysteine concentrations.

Malachite green oxalate was the example fungicide, and all experiments were at 10-degrees-C.  If the fungicide is to be used as a continuous addition to the water, as a protectant, then target stages of the fungus are identified as zoospores and secondary zoospore cysts; the latter, although physically sedimentary, have a remarkably high degree of buoyancy in the water and hence pose a constant threat to the fish.  Continuous addition to the water, to give 0.25 mg l-1 malachite green oxalate, would be expected to kill zoospores and zoospore cysts, but 0.05 mg l-1, while allowing zoospore cyst germination, was a strong inhibitor to fungal growth and, aided by natural defences of the fish, might well succeed in disease prevention.  If the fungicide is to be used as an intermittent addition to the water (every 24 h), then target stages of the fungus are small mycelia on the fish in addition to zoospores and zoospore cysts in the water.  An experimental model was made to consider the vulnerability of these small mycelia, growing on the fish over the preceding 24 h, to malachite green oxalate.  If mycelia are of narrow diameter, as expected, then 0.25 mg l-1 malachite green oxalate, applied for 15 min, should control their growth and protect the fish.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  57     Total Times Cited:  61     Cited Reference Count:  10,10.1111/j.1365-2761.1992.tb00631.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),MALACHITE GREEN,NA,NA,towards strategic use of fungicides against saprolegniaparasitica in salmonid fish hatcheries

Despite the fact that total individual numbers of the carabid populations, total species numbers, and number of dominant species were clearly higher in the field under reduced management, RENKONEN'S R, showed only a slight difference between the fields with nearly three-quarter correspondence in dominance structure. The presence of five more carabid species on the field under reduced management is underlined by the low values Of JACCARD'S species identity and WAINSTEIN's K-w index of similarity. On the other hand, according to SHANNON-WEAVER's H-s for species diversity and SHANNON's E-s for evenness, the differences between the fields are minor. Even if only the dominant species were taken into account, the similarity between both fields was obvious, despite the fact that in the field under reduced management two more dominant carabid species were found, In both fields, phytophagous Amara similata was the most abundant species. Nevertheless, a special oil seed rape carabid coenosis seems to exist as well, as one was found for cereal crops and for root crops, which might consist of A. similata, Amara aenea, Harpalus affinis, Poecilus cupreus, Pseudophonus rufipes, and Pterostichus melanarius.        For P. cupreus, which was chosen as a typically predacious and beneficial carabid species in oil seed rape, biomass, fecundity and determination of the degree of gut filling also showed no differences for the fields. Even the length of elytrae as an indicator for nutritional situation in the preceding year showed no difference. Only the phenology of P. cupreus showed an obvious shift of the peak in activity-density in the intensively managed field, to a later date in the season, compared with the field under reduced management. The latter reflects the usual spring peak. No sufficient explanation was found for the peak 4 weeks later on the intensively managed field. It can be assumed that a less sufficient food supply (higher numbers of potential food, e.g. larvae of Meligethes spp. in the field under reduced management), due to insecticide input, or long-term biocide impact on P. cupreus, or a faster growth of rape plants due to high nitrogen input resulting in a less favourable microclimate on the intensively managed field, was responsible for this later peak in activity-density.        To conclude, the relations between the predacious carabids, their potential prey, and the abiotic factors in the habitats seem to be much more complicated than assumed.

Standard procedures were used to determine the zones of inhibition, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentrations (MBCs/MFCs) for Candida albicans, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The extract showed activity against some mycobacteria strains, especially M. tuberculosis. It also showed strong antimicrobial activity (zones of inhibition were between 9.00 and 14.10 mm) against C. albicans, Sa. typhi, and St. aureus. The extract gave a better zone of inhibition against C. albicans than fluconazole whose zone of inhibition was 13.00 mm. The MICs and MBCs for C. albicans and Sa. typhi were good. The crude extracts were also analyzed for the presence of phytochemicals. Phytochemical screening indicated that the extract most abundantly contained tannins, saponins, and flavonoids.

Semiochemicals that are used in pest control are called biopesticides. Conventional pesticides, which are generally synthetically derived and unnatural, inactivate or kill the pests, whereas biopesticides are naturally occurring compounds that attract insects to a trap or interfere with their reproduction. There are several advantages to biopesticides. Compared with conventional pesticides, biochemical-based pesticides are often less toxic and therefore have a significantly lower impact on human health and the environment. Moreover, biopesticides are pest-selective and as such do not negatively impact other organisms such as insects, mammals, or birds. Other advantages of biopesticides include high potency, meaning that smaller amounts of biopesticide are required, less resistance by target organisms, and the ability to biodegrade more quickly than conventional pesticides. Although biochemical-based pesticides are very promising materials, their production is often cumbersome, and their application is often limited. To date, most biopesticides have been synthesized by multistep, classical organic reactions that are not economical and have high environmental impact. However, in recent decades many efforts have been made to implement cost-effective and safer chemical procedures for the widespread application of biochemical-based pesticides. The purpose of this Perspective is to draw the attention of the green chemistry community to the applicability of olefin metathesis reactions in environmentally benign and cost-effective biopesticide synthesis.

It is recognized that sublethal concentrations of trichlorfon alter hepatic and branchial metabolism, but the pathways involved in this process remains unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether phosphoryl transfer network can be a pathway involved in the hepatic and branchial metabolic alterations during exposure to sublethal concentrations of trichlorfon. Hepatic and branchial CK (cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms) and PK activities were inhibited after 48 h of exposure to 11 and 22 mg/L trichlorfon compared to control group, while AK activity did not differ between groups. In addition, sodium-potassium pump (Na+, K+-ATPase) activity was lower after 48 h of exposure to 22 mg/L trichlorfon compared to control group. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were higher in liver samples after 24 h of exposure to 22 mg/L trichlorfon compared to control group, as well as after 48 h of exposure to 11 and 22 mg/L trichlorfon in liver and gills. Finally, hepatic and branchial non-protein thiol (NPSH) levels were lower after 48 h of exposure to 11 and 22 mg/L trichlorfon. All evaluated parameters did not recover after 48 h in clean water. Based on these evidence, the impairment of phosphoryl transfer network can be considered a pathway involved in the hepatic and branchial metabolic alterations during exposure to sublethal concentrations of trichlorfon.

Acidification can negatively impact coastal resources such as shellfish, finfish, and coral reefs, and the communities that rely on them. Organismal responses for species located in the U.S. Southeast document large negative impacts of acidification, especially in larval stages. For example, the toxicity of pesticides increases under acidified conditions and the combination of acidification and low oxygen has profoundly negative influences on genes regulating oxygen consumption. In corals, the rate of calcification decreases with acidification and processes such as wound recovery, reproduction, and recruitment are negatively impacted. Minimizing the changes in global ocean chemistry will ultimately depend on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, but adaptation to these changes and mitigation of the local stressors that exacerbate global acidification can be addressed locally. The evolution of our knowledge of acidification, from basic understanding of the problem to the emergence of applied research and monitoring, has been facilitated by the development of regional Coastal Acidification Networks (CANs) across the United States. This synthesis is a product of the Southeast Coastal and Ocean Acidification Network (SOCAN). SOCAN was established to better understand acidification in the coastal waters of the U.S. Southeast and to foster communication among scientists, resource managers, businesses, and governments in the region.

The major stocks of PFOS are firefighting foams with minor stocks in pesticides (ant baits) and possibly carpets. The inventory of firefighting foams assessed the import, current stocks and major use sites and recent releases. Considerable amount of PFOS and potentially PFOS containing firefighting foams are stored at the military base, the oil company and small firefighting departments throughout the country. The total amount of stored PFAS firefighting foam in Suriname is estimated to be at least 275.6 tonnes, where the major stockpile of 206 tonnes is at the oil storage facilities. For some of these foams PFOS content is confirmed and for others it is not clear if the foam contains PFOS or other per- or polyfluorinated alkylated substances (PFAS). The upper estimate of PFOS content is 4133 kg in these foams. Additionally, PFOS or other PFAS has also been discovered in fire extinguishers in institutions. The total amount of PFOS related substance EtFOSA imported with the pesticide sulfluramid was 75 kg. The imports were banned in 2014 and is controlled. A considerable amount of synthetic carpets are in stores even produced before 2003 where main use of PFOS from 3 M took place possibly containing PFOS related substances. A compilation of potentially PFOS contaminated sites has been made. Potentially contaminated sites result from firefighting foam use, dumpsites and sulfluramid use. The airport where firefighting foam was applied is above a major drinking water reservoir, where an urgent assessment is needed. Due to the lack of analytical capacity for PFOS and precursors, drinking water, firefighting foam or impacted carpets, could not been analysed.

Samples from selected standard profile were subjected to chemical, pollen, and palaeoalgological analyses in order to study the chronology of vegetation development, anthropogenic impact on the landscape, and the development of an artificial fishpond ecosystem. The palaeoecological record under study comprises the period of extensive change from pre-cultural, silver fir-dominated forest vegetation into managed, agricultural landscape dominated by cereal fields and pastures. After Medieval colonization, the proportion between wooded and open landscape changed, and the composition of original forests shifted to pine. Pollen spectra from the High Middle Ages are characterized by high percentages of anthropogenic indicators and closely resemble the results from urban deposits (cesspits, wells, communication horizons, etc.). This period can be subdivided into a first phase correlated with the High and Late Middle Ages and a second phase correlated with the post Medieval period and partly maybe also with the agricultural collectivization of the 20th century. The earlier phase has a rather uniform character with a significant presence of grazing indicators and cereal weeds. After the collectivization of the 1950s and later, a substantial change in agricultural practices can be detected: the large-scale use of herbicides affecting the composition of agricultural ruderal species (e.g. decline of cornflower (Centaurea cyanus), rye (Secale), etc.).        The development of the aquatic system of the fishpond Vajgar was studied by means of chemical and palaeoalgological analyses. On the basis of observed changes in the composition of subfossil algal communities, the fishpond history can be split into four distinct phases. It is assumed that the progression over individual phases was caused by changes in water chemistry that can be interpreted as shifts in water quality caused by the urbanization of the surrounding areas as well as by changes in agricultural practices. The results of the investigation of some chemical elements (especially heavy metals) show stratigraphic patterns that can be related to historical events.

Here, we investigate the association between occupation, industry and UBC.        Methods: Lifetime occupational history was collected by in-person interview for 604 newly diagnosed UBC patients and 604 cancer-free controls. Each job title was assigned a two-digit industry code and a three-digit occupation code. Odds ratios (ORs) for UBC associated with ever being employed in an industry or occupation were calculated by unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age, gender and smoking status. We also examined UBC risk by duration of employment (>0 to <10, >= 10 years) in industry or occupation.        Results: Significantly increased risk of UBC was observed among waiters and bartenders (OR 2.87; 95% CI 1.05 to 7.72) and occupations related to medicine and health (OR 2.17; 95% CI 1.21 to 3.92), agricultural production, livestock and animal specialties (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.03 to 3.49), electrical assembly, installation and repair (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.07 to 2.65), communications (OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.00 to 3.01), and health services (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.44).

This communication reports the identification of venom components of this scorpion with biological activity over insects/crickets (Acheta domestica), crustaceans/fresh water shrimps (Cambarellus montezumae), and mammalians/mice (Mus musculus, strain CD1). It also describes the pharmacological effects on cell lines in culture (L5178Y cells, HeLa cells, HuTu cells and Jurkat E6-1 cells), as well as on several types of bacteria (see below). The soluble venom of this scorpion was fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and collected separately in twelve independent fractions collected over 60 min run (5 min time apart each other). The HPLC components of fraction VII were lethal to all three species used for assay. The IVth fraction had a toxic effect on freshwater shrimps. In this species, fractions VI, VII and VIII were all lethal. For crickets, fractions V and VI were toxic and fraction VII was lethal. In mouse, the lethal components were found in fraction VII, whereas fraction VIII was toxic, but not lethal, at the doses assayed. The molecular weight of peptides from the various group of fractions were identified by mass spectrometry determination. Components lethal to mice showed molecular weights from 7013 to 7487 Da. Two peptides were obtained in homogeneous form and shown to be lethal to the three species of animal used for assay. The soluble venom tested on L5178Y cell line survival was shown to be cytotoxic, at 10-100 mu g/mL concentration, when compared to control murine splenocytes (p = 0.007). The soluble venom applied to Hela, Hutu and Jurkat cell lines did not show cytotoxic effects at these concentrations. On the contrary, it seems to have a proliferative effect. However the HPLC fractions I, III, VI and XII do have a cytotoxic effect on Jurkat E06-1 cells in culture at 200 mu/mL concentration. The antimicrobial activity of the venom fractions on Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa y Salmonella spp (gram-negative) was measured, using the liquid inhibition growth system.

The lake's fisheries have produced around one million tonnes in recent years, but the lake's growing population has resulted in a lower catch rate per capita. And the lake and its catchment have been negatively impacted by a wide variety of human activities, such as overfishing, oil spills, discharge of untreated waste, spread of invasive species, over-abstraction of water from the lake basin, and climate change, among other drivers of change. This paper presents existing research gaps, existing capacity, and presents a way forward for priority research on issues ranging from fish and fisheries, biodiversity, pollution, invasive species, aquaculture, human population growth and socio-economics, land use changes, habitat degradation, climate change and skills and knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to document: information that is currently available from previous research; the existing scientific capacity; and the resources required to guarantee that Lake Victoria becomes a heathy and biologically diverse resource for the millions of people who are dependent on it. It is clear from this synthesis that the biological, social, and economic benefits that can be derived from Lake Victoria can only be accomplished through the utilization of multi-disciplinary approaches in the research and monitoring of both basinwide and lake-wide biophysical processes, as well as the modeling of all potential interactions between the ecology of the basin and the lake.

While many weed management strategies have been developed and deployed, there is a greater need for the development of sustainable methods for employing integrated weed management. Gene drive systems can be used as one of the approaches to suppress the aggressive growth and reproductive behavior of weeds, although their efficacy is yet to be tested. Their popularity in insect pest management has increased, however, with the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, which provides specificity and precision in editing the target gene. This review focuses on the different types of gene drive systems, including the use of CRISPR-Cas9-based systems and their success stories in pest management, while also exploring their possible applications in weed species. Factors that govern the success of a gene drive system in weeds, including the mode of reproduction, the availability of weed genome databases, and well-established transformation protocols are also discussed.

Gill is structural basis for ion regulation and homeostasis in fish and susceptible to xenobiotics. However, current knowledge on the impacts of long-term exposure to TCEP on the structure and physiological function of fish gills are insufficient. In this work, zebrafish were exposed to environmental realistic concentrations (0.8, 4, 20 and 100 mu g/L) of TCEP from 3 h post ferterlization (hpf) till 120 days post ferterlization (dpf). Our results demonstrated that life-cycle exposure to TCEP significantly decreased the activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST), but elevated the activities of anti -oxidative enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content in zebrafish gills. Gene transcription analysis implied that the mRNA expressions of antioxidant-related genes (nrf2, cat and nqo1) were induced, while the transcription of gst alpha 1, hmox1, keap1 were down-regulated, indicating that Nrf2-Keap1 pathway might be activated to defend the oxidative stress induced by TCEP. Additionally, the ion homeostasis was disrupted by TCEP exposure, evidenced by reduced activities of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), Ca2+-ATPase and Mg2+-ATPase and downregulated transcription levels of ncc,nkcc, cftr and clc-3. Besides, whole-life exposure to TCEP resulted in a series of structural damages to gills, including epithelial lifting, epithelial rupture, telangiectasis, vacuolation, edema and shortened gill lamellae. Overall, our results demonstrated that long-term TCEP exposure could induce oxidative stress, affect ion regulation and cause histological changes in zebrafish gills.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  64,10.1016/j.cbpc.2023.109746,Tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate;Oxidative stress;Ion homeostasis;Histological changes;Zebrafish;TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR;ORGANOPHOSPHATE FLAME RETARDANTS;OXIDATIVE STRESS;HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ALTERATIONS;ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION;WATER;LIVER;COTRANSPORTER;EXPRESSION;TOXICITY;Antioxidants,NA,NA,lifecycle exposure to tris 2chloroethyl phosphate tcep causes alterations in antioxidative status ion regulation and histology of zebrafish gills

Several factors are attributed to the multidimensional vulnerabilities the small-scale fishers experience, spanning both natural (e.g., natural disasters, ecosystem change) and anthropogenic (e.g., policy change, hydrological interventions, aquaculture) pressures. While there is much literature on various natural and human drivers of vulnerability in small-scale fishery communities, an absence of research connecting vulnerability with water quality is evident. Fisher communities often talk about fish in relation to the health of their aquatic habitats wherein water quality is seen as a key parameter. The link between healthy fish and good quality water has significant implications for strong and viable fishing communities. This paper examines these links further by focusing on the nature of vulnerabilities caused by water quality changes in the small-scale fishery system of Chilika Lagoon in India. We undertake detailed analysis of the invasive shrimp aquaculture activities and hydrological interventions for opening of a lagoon inlet with the Bay of Bengal as two dominant drivers adversely impacting water quality and increasing vulnerabilities of the entire small-scale fisheries social-ecological system. Our analysis suggests that there are strong interconnections between changes in water quality and the levels of vulnerabilities in the SSFs of Chilika Lagoon. Pollutants such as pesticides, and organic compounds accumulate in fish tissues and affect their growth, reproduction, and overall health. This led to declines in fish populations, making it more difficult for fishers to make a living. In addition to direct impacts on fish populations, poor water quality also has indirect effects on the social and economic vulnerability of SSFs. For example, contamination of water sources led to the reduced number of fish species reducing the amount of time fishers can spend on fishing activities. This also affected the marketability of fish products, reduced income and increased poverty. To fully understand the interconnections between water quality and vulnerability in SSFs in Chilika Lagoon, it is important to consider both environmental and social factors, as well as the complex feedback loops between these factors. The study helps in bridging a crucial gap in our understanding of the role of water quality in vulnerability analysis within resource dependent communities. We conclude with key insights on possible coping responses and adaptive capacity necessary for the small-scale fisheries communities to transition toward viability.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  76,10.3389/fmars.2023.1087296     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),small-scale fisheries;water quality;vulnerability;viability;Chilika lagoon;India;ECOLOGICAL REGIME SHIFTS;COMMUNITIES;POLITICS,NA,NA,uncovering water quality and evaluating vulnerabilities of smallscale fisheries in chilika lagoon india

During the communist era, the surface area of the agricultural land increased at the expense of natural ecosystems. This resulted in increased provisions being made for crops and timber at the expense of the fish supply; it also caused a reduction in livestock. The costs of land reclamation, hydrotechnical works, and the use of fertilizers and pesticides, resulted in a net annual loss of EUR 36 million for the entire case study area, disregarding the losses of other ES.

In actual produc-tion, weed control in paddy fields is inseparable from cyhalofop-butyl and pyribenzoxim, while its risk to P. clarkii is still unclear. The present study investigated the risk of acute and subchronic toxicity of cyhalofop-butyl and pyribenzoxim to P. clarkii. The results showed that cyhalofop-butyl and pyribenzoxim exposure for 28 days could ac-cumulate in P. clarkii muscle and inhibit P. clarkii growth. Further research found that the malondialdehyde (MDA) level and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity in muscle of P. clarkii were significantly increased after exposure to cyhalofop-butyl and pyribenzoxim (4 days and 28 days), and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were significantly altered. Histological results also confirmed cyhalofop-butyl and pyribenzoxim-induced muscle damage in P. clarkii. Additionally, after 28 days exposure to 1.02 mg/L cyhalofop-butyl and 10.4 mg/L pyribenzoxim, transcriptome analysis identified 2029 and 4246 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively.

Intelligent nanopesticides with precise controlled release modes are currently an emerging area of interest in the field of green, safe, and sustainable pesticide formulation. In this study, beta- cypermethrin (beta-CYP) was loaded into ZIF-8 by the one-pot method, which successfully prepared a pH-responsive delivery nanoparticle (beta-CYP/ZIF-8) to control termites. Results demon-strated that beta-CYP/ZIF-8 had a mean diameter of 188 +/- 2 nm and a loading capacity of approximately 21%. In vitro release experiments showed that beta-CYP/ZIF-8 releases better in acidic than in neutral conditions due to the presence of intermediate acid-unstable imidazole organic compounds. The acidic microenviron-ment in which termites thrive can promote beta-CYP release due to ZIF-8 decomposition, thus improving pesticide targeting and reducing toxic side effects. The bioactivity survey confirmed that beta-CYP/ZIF-8 could control termites (Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki) for a longer duration compared to commercial wettable powder (WP) and emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Moreover, an acute toxicity test showed an over 2-and 10-fold reduction in the acute toxicity of beta-CYP/ZIF-8 to earthworms and zebrafish, respectively, compared to that of commercial WP and EC. Finally, the cytotoxicity assay of beta-CYP/ZIF-8 showed higher safety to human hepatocyte LO2 cells. Overall, these beta-CYP/ZIF-8 nanoparticles, prepared using the one-pot method, have great application potential in sustainable pest management and protection of the ecological environment.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  20     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  48,10.1021/acsanm.2c02856     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),metal-organic frameworks;nanoparticles;pesticide;pH-responsive release;termite control;environmental evaluation;SUSTAINED-RELEASE;BETA-CYPERMETHRIN;HOLLOW ZIF-8;TOXICITY;SYSTEM;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration,NA,NA,phresponsive zif8based metalorganicframework nanoparticles for termite control

Effects of climate changes have been already reported on feeding behaviour and reproductive process of organisms. Another consequence for organisms includes the POP bioaccumulation. Here we review the literature reporting the linkage between recorded effects of climate changes and POP bioaccumulation in resident marine Antarctic species (fish and penguins). Notwithstanding Antarctica is a final sink for persistent contaminants due to the extreme cold climate, a general decreasing POP trend has been observed for some POPs. Their concentrations in biota are reported to be linked to ice melting and large iceberg calving; the peculiar marine Antarctic ecosystems and the pelagic-benthic coupling may also contribute to alterations in the bioaccumulation processes. These effects are similar in polar regions, although the comparison with the Arctic biota is not possible due to the lack of data in the Antarctic Region.

This study is the first known attempt to use separated fish residues as soil amendments for soil biosolarization (SBS), a soil treatment method which is an environment-friendly alternative to chemical fumigation of soil. In this study a unique laboratory simulation system was used which mimics the conditions of field temperature, monitors the soil respiration and the follows the temporal profile of emitted volatile organic compounds. The fish waste residues were used as soil amendment in 2% wt. and the results showed elevated levels of aerobic soil respiration without unwanted CH4 emission. A different profile of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was also identified in the soils treated with fish residues. The profile of volatiles found in the soil with fish residues included changes in the amounts of compounds such as: Dimethylsulfide, Methanethiol and C9-aldehydes that have been found to supress soilborne plant pathogens. This is the first indication that VOCs can be used as indicators for the SBS process. Greenhouse studies and analyses of soils treated by fish residues showed no soil residual phytotoxicity affecting later growth of lettuce seedlings while not hindering the herbicidal effect of SBS on unwanted Bidens (Bidens pilosa) weeds.

Toxicity was examined at individual, biochemical, and molecular levels and via phenotypic traits. Rotifers exposed to 10 ng/L TPT group showed increased population size, improved reproductive rate, and a higher weekly growth rate. At 100 ng/L TPT group, the greatest degree of oxidative damage was seen. Exposure to 200 ng/L TPT group shorten generation time, delayed reproduction, and obscured the reproductive peak. Expression of the Vasa gene associated with reproduction was increased after exposure to 10 and 200 ng/L TPT group and decreased at 100 ng/L TPT group. High concentrations of TPT reduced rotifer body length and width and slowed swimming speed. Findings provide a better understanding of the adverse effects of changing TPT concentrations on marine rotifer, by the life cycle parameters, oxidative stress defense mechanisms, expression of a gene related to reproduction, and phenotypic traits.

Chemical-insecticide-based mosquito control has been successful in reducing the burden of malaria. However, the emergence of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors and concerns about the effect of the chemicals on the environment, human health, and non-target organisms present a need for new or alternative vector control intervention tools. Biocontrol methods using aquatic invertebrate predators have emerged as a potential alternative and additional tool to control mosquito populations. Ecological control specifically makes use of species insights for improving the physical habitat conditions of competitors and predators of vectors. A first step towards this is to gain knowledge on the predation potential of several typically present macroinvertebrates. Hence, this study aimed at (1) examining the influence of the predation of hemipterans on the number of emerging adult mosquitoes and (2) detecting Anopheles mosquito DNA in the gut of those predators. The prey and predators were collected from a range of water bodies located in the Gilgel Gibe watershed, southwest Ethiopia. A semi-field study was carried out using mesocosms which were constructed using plastic containers mimicking the natural aquatic habitat of immature Anopheles mosquitoes. Adult mosquitoes that emerged from the mesocosms were collected using a mechanical aspirator. At the end of the experiment, predators were withdrawn from the mesocosms and identified to genus level. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was employed to identify sibling species of Anopheles gambiae s.l. and to detect Anopheles mosquito DNA in the gut of the predators. Data were analysed using R software. Giant water bugs (belostomatids) were the most aggressive predators of Anopheles larvae, followed by backswimmers (notonectids) and water boatmen (corixids). All female Anopheles gambiae s.l. emerged from the mesocosms were identified as Anopheles arabiensis. Anopheles arabiensis DNA was detected in the gut content of hemipteran specimens analysed from the three families. The number of the adult mosquitoes emerging from the mesocosms was affected by the presence of predators. The findings of this study provide evidence of the potential use of aquatic macroinvertebrate predators as biocontrol agents against immature Anopheles mosquitoes and their potential to be considered as a component of integrated vector management for insecticide resistance and the combined restoration of aquatic ecosystems via smart ecological engineering.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  58,10.3390/ijerph18136904     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),malaria;Anopheles larvae;predators;gut analysis;semi-field experiment;Ethiopia;CULEX-QUINQUEFASCIATUS DIPTERA;OVIPOSITION HABITAT SELECTION;ANOPHELES-GAMBIAE;CULICIDAE;INSECTS;DYTISCIDAE;CORIXIDAE;FISH;Prednisolone;Culicidae;Malaria,NA,NA,mesocosm experiments to quantify predation of mosquito larvae by aquatic predators to determine potential of ecological control of malaria vectors in ethiopia

To identify effective peptides, the minimum inhibitory concentrations against bacterial pathogens Edwardsiella ictaluri S97-773, Edwardsiella piscicida E22-10, A. hydrophila ML09-119, Aeromonas veronii 03X03876, and Flavobacterium columnare GL-001 were determined in vitro. In general and overall, cathelicidins derived from alligator and sea snake exhibited more potent and rapid antimicrobial activities against the tested catfish pathogens as compared to cecropin and pleurocidin AMPs and ampicillin, the antibiotic control. When the peptides (2.5 mu g of peptide/g of fish) were injected into fish and simultaneously challenged with A. hydrophila through immersion, increased survival rates in Channel Catfish and hybrid catfish were observed in both cathelicidin (alligator and sea snake) treatments as compared to other peptides and the infected control (P < 0.001) with alligator cathelicidin being the overall best treatment. Bacterial numbers in the kidney and liver of Channel Catfish and hybrid catfish also decreased (P < 0.05) for cathelicidin-injected groups at 24 and 48 h after challenge infection. These results show the potential of cathelicidin to protect catfish against bacterial infections and suggest that an approach overexpressing the peptide in transgenic fish, which is the long-term goal of this research program, may provide a method of decreasing bacterial disease problems in catfish as delivering the peptides via individual injection or feeding would not be economically feasible.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  56,10.1002/aah.10131,HOST-DEFENSE PEPTIDES;CHANNEL CATFISH;ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY;RESISTANCE;INFECTION;PUNCTATUS;GENES;FISH;IDENTIFICATION;SEPTICEMIA;C-Peptide,NA,NA,effectiveness of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide against ictalurid catfish bacterial pathogens

In this context. Roundup (R), a glyphosate-based herbicide, has been widely detected in natural water bodies, representing a potential threat to non-target organisms, namely fish. Thus, the main goal of the present study was to evaluate the genotoxic potential of Roundup (R) in the teleost fish Anguilla anguilla, addressing the possible causative involvement of oxidative stress. Fish were exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of this herbicide (58 and 116 mu g L-1) during one or three clays. The standard procedure of the comet assay was applied to gill and liver cells in order to determine organ-specific genetic damage. Since liver is a central organ in xenobiotic metabolism, nucleoids of hepatic cells were also incubated with a lesion-specific repair enzyme (formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase - FPG), in order to recognise oxidised purines. Antioxidants were determined in both organs as indicators of pro-oxidant state. In general, both organs displayed an increase in DNA damage for the two Roundup (R) concentrations and exposure times, although liver showed to be less susceptible to the lower concentration. The enzyme-modified comet assay showed the occurrence of FPG-sensitive sites in liver only after a 3-day exposure to the higher Roundup (R) concentration. The antioxidant defences were in general unresponsive, despite a single increment of catalase activity in gills (116 mu L-1, 3-day) and a decrease of superoxide dismutase activity in liver (58 mu g L-1 3-day). Overall, the mechanisms involved in Roundup (R)-induced DNA strand-breaks showed to be similar in both organs. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the type of DNA damage varies with the concentration and exposure duration. Hence, after 1-day exposure, an increase on pro-oxidant state is not a necessary condition for the induction of DNA-damaging effects of Roundup (R). By increasing the duration of exposure to three days, ROS-depenclent processes gained preponderance as a mechanism of DNA-damage induction in the higher concentration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We document that the effectiveness of LERs in reducing border pollution can be attributed to the fact that LERs require local governments to make collective decisions in fighting livestock pollution.

The impact of these changes on inter- and intra-specific communication, and its evolutionary consequences, has only recently started to receive research attention. A disruption of the sensory environment is likely to impact communication, especially with respect to reproductive interactions that help to maintain species boundaries. Aquatic ecosystems around the world are being threatened by a variety of environmental stressors, causing dramatic losses of biodiversity and bringing urgency to the need to understand how fish respond to rapid environmental changes. Here, we discuss current research on different communication systems (visual, chemical, acoustic, electric) and explore the state of our knowledge of how complex systems respond to environmental stressors using fish as a model. By far the bulk of our understanding comes from research on visual communication in the context of mate selection and competition for mates, while work on other communication systems is accumulating. In particular, it is increasingly acknowledged that environmental effects on one mode of communication may trigger compensation through other modalities. The strength and direction of selection on communication traits may vary if such compensation occurs. However, we find a dearth of studies that have taken a multimodal approach to investigating the evolutionary impact of environmental change on communication in fish. Future research should focus on the interaction between different modes of communication, especially under changing environmental conditions.

At the neuroendocrine level, dopamine (DA) drives behavioral (locomotion, emotion, feeding, and social interactions, etc.) and reproductive functions of fish. In the current investigation, we examined effects of rotenone toxicity on neurobehavioral and reproductive functions in whole brain and in selected brain regions in an Indian freshwater catfish, locally known as gulsha (Mystus cavasius). After fish were exposed to water containing rotenone at 0, 2.5, 25, and 250 mu g/L for 2 days, significant reductions of DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC; a DA metabolite), and their ratio (DOPAC/DA) were observed in whole brain at 250 mg/L ambient concentrations of rotenone. When fish were treated with rotenone at 250 mg/L concentration for 2 days, there was a significant reduction of DA, DOPAC and DOPAC/DA in diencephalon, DA and DOPAC in pituitary, and only DA in the telencephalon, compared with control fish. In parallel, numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (THthorn) neurons declined significantly in the diencephalon and pituitary after rotenone treatment. Slowed, spontaneous movement and reduced feeding behavior were observed in rotenone-treated fish. Rotenone treatment resulted in a significantly higher gonadosomatic index with many mature vitellogenic oocytes in ovaries and lowered dopaminergic activity in these fish. These results indicate that rotenone influences neurobehavioral and reproductive functions through dopaminergic neuronal cell loss in gulsha brain. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Three types of lysozymes have been identified in metazoan, the c-type (chicken or conventional), the g-type (goose-type) and the i-type (invertebrate type). They are all involved in the hydrolysation of the bacterial cell wall. Our work has been focused on the molecular characterization, expression analysis by real-time PCR, both at basal condition and after in vivo challenges, and 3D structural studies on the g-type lysozyme from sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.). Moreover, a recombinant sea bass lysozyme has been produced in Escherichia coli and used to investigate the activity of the enzyme at different pH and temperatures and to perform antibacterial assays against typical fish pathogens. The cloned sea bass cDNA for g-type lysozyme (accession number FN667957) consists of 742 bp and translates for a putative protein of 188 amino acids. The molecular weight is 20.251, 41 Da with a theoretical pI of 8.53, two cysteine residues along the sequence and no putative signal peptide. These features of the enzyme are in agreement with the expected characteristics of a proper g-type lysozyme, except for the cysteine residues that in fish are quite variable in number. An alignment between known g-type lysozyme sequences evidences that the amino acid residues thought to be involved in the enzyme catalysis (G1u(71), Asp(84) and Asp(95) in sea bass) are quite well conserved between mammalian, avian and fish sequences. The sea bass g-type lysozyme gene is composed of four exons and three introns and this gene structure is more compact compared to other known fish lysozyme homologues. Modeling of 3D structure has been performed on the template structure of g-type lysozyme from Atlantic cod. The catalytic site appears well conserved when compared with known structures of fish g-type lysozymes (cod and salmon). The basal expression of lysozyme transcripts is highest in gills, followed by head kidney and peripheral blood leukocytes. The lysozyme expression is up regulated in head kidney leukocytes both after challenge with the fish bacterial pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida. The lytic activity, determined using as substrate Micrococcus lysodeikticus, was optimal at pH 5.5 and at a temperature of 30 degrees C. In conclusion, these results suggest that the identified g-type lysozyme should be involved in the innate immune responses of sea bass. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the leucocytes present in the peritoneal exudate of the infected fish (macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophilic granular cells, lymphocytes and thrombocytes), macrophages and neutrophils were the only phagocytic cells. Neutrophils were easily distinguished from macrophages in Antonow stained preparations by the pattern of peroxidase positivity. Using ultrastructural cytochemistry, neutrophils were found to have abundant cytoplasmic granules positive for peroxidase and arylsulphatase and were negative for alpha-naphthyl butyrate (ANB) esterase. In contrast, ANB esterase activity was detected in macrophages. These leucocytes were typically negative for peroxidase, but occasionally, some macrophages with peroxidase or arylsulphatase-positive vacuoles were observed. Both phagocytes had cytoplasmic granules positive for acid phosphatase. Glycogen particles were found in the cytoplasm of the two phagocytic cells, but they were much more abundant in neutrophils. Macrophages were much more abundant than neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity of non-injected sea bass but early after the intraperitoneal injection of bacteria, the number of neutrophils increased quickly and extensively. Higher numbers of intraperitoneally injected bacteria were found inside macrophages as compared to neutrophils because macrophages strongly predominated in the peritoneal population at the time of injection. However, when the bacteria were injected into peritoneal cavities with high numbers of neutrophils (attracted by a previous injection of 12% casein), the percentage of neutrophils with phagocytosed bacteria increased, approaching that of infected macrophages. Taken together, these results show that in sea bass, as in many other organisms, in addition to macrophages, neutrophils are important phagocytic cells, the relative participation of each, of the two phagocytes in defense mechanisms against infection depending on the opportunity to encounter the invading infectious agents.

In addition, several substances have been reported in the environment that can cause damage to aquatic species, such as potassium perchlorate (KClO4), if exposed to high concentrations or for long periods. Often, the co-presence of different contaminants can cause a synergistic action in terms of toxicity to fish. In the present study, we first analyzed different concentrations of IMI (75, 100 and 150 mg/L) and KClO4 (1, 1.5 and 5 mM) to highlight the morphological effects at 96 hpf and, subsequently, chose two nontoxic concentrations to evaluate their co-exposure and the pathway involved in their co-toxicity. Morphological alteration, mucus production, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression related to intestinal function and oxidative stress were measured.

The use of GBHs is intended to tackle weeds, but GBHs have been shown to affect the life-history traits and antioxidant defense system of invertebrates found in agroecosystems. Thus far, the effects of GBHs on detoxification pathways among invertebrates have not been sufficiently investigated. We performed two different experiments-1) the direct pure glyphosate and GBH treatment, and 2) the indirect GBH experiment via food-to examine the possible effects of environmentally relevant GBH levels on the survival of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) and the expression profiles of their detoxification genes. As candidate genes, we selected four cytochrome P450 (CYP), three glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and two acetylcholinesterase (AChE) genes that are known to be related to metabolic or target-site resistances in insects. We showed that environmentally relevant levels of pure glyphosate and GBH increased the probability for higher mortality in the Colorado potato beetle larvae in the direct experiment, but not in the indirect experiment. The GBHs or glyphosate did not affect the expression profiles of the studied CYP, GST, or AChE genes; however, we found a large family-level variation in expression profiles in both the direct and indirect treatment experiments. These results suggest that the genes selected for this study may not be the ones expressed in response to glyphosate or GBHs. It is also possible that the relatively short exposure time did not affect gene expression profiles, or the response may have already occurred at a shorter exposure time.

Materials and Methods: The experiment was carried out on 120 fish that randomly divided into four equal groups with three replicates: The first group kept as control, the second group exposed to 1/2 96 h lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of Roundup, the third group exposed to 1/2 96 h LC50 of Stomp, and the fourth one exposed to a combination of Roundup and Stomp at previously-mentioned doses. The experiment was terminated after 15 days; blood samples were obtained at 1st, 8th, and 15th days of treatment where the sera were separated for estimation of antioxidant enzymes. Meanwhile, at 15th day of exposure part of blood was collected from all groups with an anticoagulant for evaluation of phagocytic activity, then the fish were sacrificed, and specimens from the liver of all groups were obtained for histopathological examination.        Results: Our results indicated that both herbicides either individually or in combination elucidated significant decrease in phagocytic activity that was highly marked in group exposed to both herbicides. Furthermore, our data elicited an obvious elevation in the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Meanwhile, the data depicted reduction in levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Histopathological investigation of liver proved the aforementioned results.

Therefore, it's urgent to develop sensitive methods to detect and analyse pesticides. Herein, we successfully developed a new turn-on fluorescent chemosensor (TPE-4P), a tetraphenyl ethylene derivative modified with four pillar[5]arenes, which could sensitively, selectively, and rapidly detect the pesticide paraquat. In our study, we took full advantage of both the host-guest strategy and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) to achieve fluorescent enhancement of the chemosensor for paraquat, in which four pillar[5]arenes as the recognition units can selectively capture paraquat. The formation of the supramolecular complexes based on the interlaced host-guest interactions effectively restricted the intramolecular single-bond rotation and skeletal vibration, resulting in the intensive fluorescent emission. The detection limit for paraquat was low enough to reach 154.1 nM, and the detection time was short enough to meet the rapid detection conditions. Moreover, the test strips loaded-TPE-4P facilitated the detection process and achieved the semi-quantitative analysis for paraquat in real spiked samples. In addition, TPE-4P could respond to paraquat in living zebrafish obviously.

Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2))-mediated release of arachidonic acid has been shown to play an essential role in superoxide anion (O-2(-)) production in neutrophils exposed to various physiologic and pharmacologic agents. Therefore, studies were performed to determine if the organochlorine pesticides, lindane and dieldrin, activate neutrophils to produce O-2(-) by a mechanism that requires PLA(2). Production of O-2(-) and H-3-AA release increased with similar kinetics and concentration-response relations in neutrophils activated with either dieldrin or lindane. Significant release of H-3-AA was seen in neutrophils stimulated with dieldrin or lindane in calcium-free medium and in the presence of the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM, suggesting that these agents stimulate a PLA(2) that does not require calcium for activation. In addition, both O-2(-) production and H-3-AA release were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by EEL, a mechanism-based inhibitor of calcium-independent PLA(2), These data suggest that dieldrin and lindane stimulate O-2(-) production by a mechanism that involves PLA(2). However, release of H-3-AA was not abrogated completely by EEL nor, in the case of dieldrin, preserved entirely in the absence of calcium.

Biomarkers selected for stress monitoring were malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant defense system (ADS) mainly reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), peroxidase (GSH-PX), transferase (GST) and superoxidedismutase (SOD) activities in the liver, gills and muscle of fishes exposed to 0.5 and 1 ppm dosages of MP and diazinon for 24,48 and 72 h. According to these results, after the administrations of MP and diazinon promote MDA content in some of the tissues of fishes treated with both dosages of MP and diazinon. With regard to the ADS, GSH-Px, GST, SOD, GR activities and GSH levels fluctuated after 24, 48 and 72 h in all the treatment groups compared with controls. Collective results demonstrated that exposure of fish to pesticides induced an increase in MDA joined with fluctuated ADS.

However, studies on the effects of CL on freshwater fishes are still incipient. In this context, we evaluated the acute effects of a commercial formulation containing CL (Karate Zeon (R) CS 50) in juveniles of the teleost Prochilodus lineatus exposed for 96 h to four concentrations of the active ingredient (5, 50, 250 and 500 ng.L-1). Biochemical, physiological, and genotoxic biomarkers were evaluated in different organs of the fish. Exposure to CL induced significant changes in the enzymatic profiles of P. lineatus, with specific alterations in biotransformation enzymes and antioxidant defence in different tissues. Lipid peroxidation was observed in fish gills and kidney. Increases in esterases were observed in the liver of fish exposed to all CL concentrations evaluated, whereas acetylcholinesterase activity decreased in the muscles of fish at all concentrations. CL also promoted osmoregulatory disorders, with decreases in calcium and magnesium gill ATPases, with consequent hypocalcaemia, in addition an increase in sodium-potassium ATPase activity was observed in the gills of fish exposed to the highest CL concentration, probably in order to compensate a reduction in plasma sodium. Besides, increases in DNA damage were observed in the erythrocytes of fish exposed to all CL concentrations. Thus, despite the low CL concentrations and the short exposure time, this pyrethroid caused hematological adjustments, oxidative stress, osmoregulatory disorders, and DNA damage in P. lineatus, showing that the species is highly sensitive to the deleterious effects of CL.

In non-diazinon-exposed fish, the hepatic levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) elevated in fish supplemented with 6 and 10 g ORG/kg diet compared to control group (non-ORG-supplemented fish). The supplementation of fish with 14 g ORG/kg diet significantly decreased the hepatic antioxidant enzymes compared to control. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels remained unchanged in all groups throughout the experiment. The serum levels of hepatic metabolic enzymes [(aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LHD)] remained unchanged in all experimental groups throughout the experiment. In diazinon-exposed groups, the activity of SOD, GPx, and TAC in liver elevated after exposure to diazinon in fish fed 2, 6, and 10 g ORG/kg diet. The CAT activity increased only in fish supplemented with 6 and 10 g ORG/kg diet.

First, we review the early literature on the species and aim to resolve its path towards becoming the globally dominant fish for biological control of mosquitoes. We identify the initial advocates of mosquitofish use, we examine the reasons behind their advocacy, and we document the spread of their viewpoints into and from the globally foundational mosquito control texts. Second, we identify the people and institutions that facilitated early international translocations of mosquitofish, including, among others, David Starr Jordan, the Rockefeller Foundation and the International Red Cross. Third, we discuss the reduction in mosquitofish translocation and use during and after WWII, initially stemming from the discovery and use of other methods, like DDT and later from a recognition of the negative ecological consequences of non-native mosquitofish populations. Fourth, we propose that the future utility of mosquitofish is largely in its value as a model study organism.

To study the effect of fipronil toxicity on environmental health, 6 h post fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos were treated with fipronil for 72 h. LC50 value was obtained by applying varying concentrations of fipronil to zebrafish embryos for 72 h. As zebrafish embryos are useful vertebrate models for studying developmental and genetic findings in toxicology research, they were exposed to fipronil to study detailed elucidating mechanisms with hazardous end points of toxicity. Cell cycle arrest-related apoptosis supported pathological alterations, such as increased mortality, shortened body length, and reduced hatchability. Furthermore, observed heart defects, including edema and irregular heartbeat were caused due to abnormal blood circulation. In transgenic zebrafish models (fli1:eGFP and olig2:dsRED), disrupted blood vessel formations were indicated by eGFP(+) endothelial cells.

Aminotriazole (ATA), an inhibitor of catalase (CAT), L-buthionine sulfoximine (L-BSO), an inhibitor of glutathione (GSH) synthesis, and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a glutathione precursor, were used to investigate the role of CAT and GSH redox cycle in protection against the adrenal toxicity of endosulfan, a pesticide that impairs cell viability (LC50 366 muM) and cortisol secretion (EC50 19 muM) in a concentration-related manner. Pretreatment with ATA and L-BSO enhanced the toxicity of endosulfan (LC50 and EC50, respectively, 302 and 2.6 muM with ATA, 346 and 3.1 muM with L-BSO), while pretreatment with NAC had no significant effect on cell viability and increased the EC50 of endosulfan to 51 muM. CAT activity was significantly reduced following exposure to endosulfan when cells were pretreated with ATA. Pretreatment with L-BSO significantly decreased glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in a concentration-related manner following exposure to endosulfan, while GSH levels were significantly higher in NAC pretreated cells compared to untreated cells. Finally, pretreatment with ATA and L-BSO increased, while pretreatment with NAC decreased, lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) levels. CAT, GPx, and GSH were identified as important antioxidants in maintaining the function and integrity of rainbow trout adrenocortical cells and ATA, L-BSO, and NAC were identified as effective modulators of CAT and GSH redox cycle.

In this research, it was investigated the larvicidal effect and mechanisms of action of the ethanolic extract and of the main constituents of Annona mucosa against Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. The compounds were isolated from the ethanolic seed extract by successive silica gel chromatographic columns and characterized by NMR and Infrared spectroscopic analysis, as well as by comparison with literature data, as the acetogenins rolliniastatin 1 and rollinicin. Third- and fourth-instar larvae were submitted to different concentrations of ethanolic extract, rolliniastatin 1 and rollinicin to estimate the LC50 and LC90 after 24 h exposure. The ethanolic extract and rolliniastatin 1 were more active against Ae. albopictus, with LC50 values of 0.55 and 0.20 mu g.mL-1, respectively, compared with Ae. aegypti, on which they exhibited values of 2.60 and 0.43 mu g.mL-1, respectively.

Owing to the low degradation rate, highwater solubility, and leaching potential, TBU is believed to have harmful effects on aquatic organisms, such as anuran tadpoles. Contaminant effects can be influenced by temperature since increases in temperature are often associated with increased metabolic reactions. In this study, we evaluated the influence of temperature on the negative effects of TBU in bullfrog tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus) through a multibiomarker approach. Tadpoles were exposed to 0 (control) 10, 50, and 200 ng L-1 of TBU for 16 days at 25 and 32 degrees C. TBU increased the transcript levels of genes involved in biotransformation (glutathione S-transferase, GST, and sulfotransferase, SULT) and antioxidant (superoxide dismutase, SOD, and catalase, CAT) enzymes. TBU exposure also increased CAT and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, whereas SOD and carboxylesterase activities were decreased. The highest temperature caused a decrease in the activities of ethoxyresorufin-Odeethylase and SOD but increased the activities of GST, GPx, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and acetylcholinesterase. No effects of temperature or TBU exposure were observed in genotoxic markers (frequencies of micronucleous and nuclear abnormalities) or in lipid peroxidation levels. Tadpoles exposed to TBU at all tested concentrations presented a higher index of biomarker responses than that of the control groups. Higher values of severity scores from histological analyses were found in the liver of tadpoles exposed to 50 and 200 ng L-1 of TBU at 32 degrees C compared with those of the control group at the same temperature. These results indicate that TBU and temperature increases are able to disturb the metabolic homeostasis of L. catesbeianus tadpoles after 16 days of exposure, causing substantial alterations in biomarker responses and liver morphology.

Ecotoxicoproteomics has been employed to elucidate biological pathways affected by chemicals and provide data that can be incorporated into adverse outcome pathways (AOP) to better define the ecological risk of emerging pollutants. Microplastics (MPs) and plastic additives have raised global concern due to their widespread use in aquatic environments, bioaccumulation in tissues, and toxic effects in aquatic organisms. Despite showing sublethal toxicity in many cases, mechanisms underlying these emerging pollutants are underexplored. In this review, adverse effects and recent ecotoxicoproteomic studies of MPs and typical additives (i.e. plasticizers, flame retardants, antioxidants, and UV stabilizers) in aquatic organisms are summarized. Proteomics data show that MPs adversely affect ingestion and reproduction via disrupting pathways related to energy metabolism, stress-related defense, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Biological processes including lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, skeletal development, neurotransmitter signaling, and immune response are modulated by additives and induce developmental malformations in fish embryos/larvae. Furthermore, plastic additives also exert reproductive toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and neurotoxicity in invertebrates (e.g. mussel, abalone, and oyster) and fish by disrupting detoxification/oxidative stress, hormonal modulation, signal transduction, and apoptosis.

The exogenous treatments were applied under moist and dry soil conditions. Spore viability was determined by the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining technique, with a qPCR assay used to compare general patterns of decline. Over 96% of oospores lost viability over a period of 48 weeks irrespective of soil moisture conditions. The mean percentage viability for oospores decreased from 91% at time zero to 72, 35, 20 and 1% after 6, 12, 24 and 48 weeks, respectively. Reduction in viability of chlamydospores was more rapid than oospores, with viability declining from 92% to zero after 12 weeks.

It was more prevalent among workers older than 45 years (3.29-10.96 95% IC; OR = 3.30;p = .0018), Caucasians (phototypes I and II) (4.78-16.12 95% IC; OR = 10.81;p < .0001), illiterate individuals (2.16-21.59 95% IC; OR = 10.43;p = .0037), those with 6 or fewer years of formal schooling (2.03-7.89 95% IC; OR = 4.63;p = .0013), those regularly using pesticides (1.58-6.64 95% IC; OR = 2.79;p = .0260) and those who used the private health service in their last appointment (1.17-3.54 95% IC; OR = 2.72;p = .0083).        Conclusion: There was a substantial prevalence of AC among rural workers with advanced age, white skin, and illiteracy, those with lower levels of education, those who regularly use pesticides, and those who utilised private health services in their last appointment. Thus, healthcare strategies that include rural workers are required for the control and prevention of AC in both public and private health services.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  24,10.1111/odi.13610,cheilitis;epidemiology;rural population;solar energy;PREVALENCE;FISHERMEN;EXPOSURE;LESIONS,NA,NA,social and behavioural associated factors of actinic cheilitis in rural workers

The yellow mealworm is the most widely bred and traded insect species in Europe that has high feed conversion ratio; 3.4 to 6.1 kg of feed ingested per kg of harvested larvae. Mealworms could compete with livestock due to their high protein and fat content and low environmental impact. Mealworms have been extensively researched as a source of feed for animals, including poultry, fish, pets and birds. Its nutrient content depends on the processing method, where thermal processing is least desirable. Mealworms are characterised by a high and variable microbial load which has to be reduced before consumption. The antibiotics, pesticides and other substances should also be analysed to ensure that mealworms are a safe protein source for human consumption.

Community members' training for handling and preventing decompression sickness among divers, and the collaboration between a local health representative, stakeholders and authorities, were identified as contributing factors in reducing fatalities and sequels among divers in the past. Technology and safety on board the vessels, training of healthcare personnel in OSH, and access to health programs, were identified as remaining challenges. Through risk mapping, the participants identified the relationship between working and health conditions in the community, reinforcing the necessity of improving access to health and social security.

In this work, we evaluated the effects of the sulfated polysaccharide ulvan from Ulva ohnoi on Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) juveniles at the transcriptomic level. Cytotoxicity assay performed in liver primary cell cultures from sole determined that the different ulvan concentrations assayed did not impair cell viability. Juveniles were intraperitoneally (IP) injected with ulvan (0.5 mg/fish) followed by a challenge with Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp) at 7 days. RNASeq analyses at 2 days post injection (dpi) revealed that 402 transcripts were differentially expressed in liver between ulvan IP injected and control groups before the challenge. Genes related to bacterial and antiviral defence, complement system, chemokines, proteasomes and antigen presentation were upregulated in ulvan treated groups. A detailed expression analysis of sixteen genes related to innate and adaptive immune system was performed in two systemic tissues: liver and spleen. Ulvan injection provoked the upregulation of tlr22 and a transient inflammatory response was initiated in both liver and spleen at 2 dpi. As consequence, expression of acute phase proteins, antimicrobial peptides and complement genes was induced. Moreover, expression of mhcI, mhcII, psmb10 and bcl6 was also induced 2 dpi. M 2 dpi with Phdp, inflammatory cytokines and genes related to bacterial and antiviral defense, iron metabolism, complement system and antigen presentation were differentially modulated in survival juveniles previously IP injected with ulvan. Moreover, mortality was retarded in ulvan treated juveniles. These results provide new evidence about the role of ulvan as a bioactive compound with immunomodulatory activity in Senegalese sole as well as its possible use as vaccine adjuvant against Phdp.

TPHP has previously been shown to disrupt behaviour in fish and mammals, but to our knowledge, this is the first study on the behavioural effects of TPHP in birds. Early life stage Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were exposed to nominal doses of 0 ng/g (vehicle-control), 5 ng/g (low dose), 50 ng/g (mid dose), and 100 ng/g (high dose) TPHP, both as embryos (via air cell injection prior to incubation) and as chicks (via daily gavage until 5 days post-hatch). The low dose reflects TPHP levels recorded in wild avian eggs, but actual environmental exposure levels may be higher given that TPHP is known to be rapidly metabolized in birds. We previously reported that the chicks exposed to TPHP in this study experienced reduced growth and resting metabolic rate, and sex-specific changes in thyroid function. The current study focuses on behavioural endpoints. We found that high-TPHP chicks exhibited less neophobia than vehicle-controls, and low-TPHP chicks exhibited more aggression towards conspecifics. No differences were observed in the responses of Japanese quail chicks to activity or tonic immobility (fear response) tests. These data add weight of evidence to previous findings suggesting that TPHP, among other OPEs, can disrupt ecologically-relevant behaviours in exposed vertebrates.

In this study, kras(V12) genetically modified zebrafish, Tg(fabp10:rtTA2s-M2; TRE2:EGFP-kras(G12V)), a model system in which liver tumors can be induced by doxycycline (DOX), was used to evaluate the liver tumor promotion potential of TDCIPP. Briefly, kras(V12) transgenic females were exposed to 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP, 20 mg/L DOX or a binary mixture of 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP with 20 mg/L DOX, and liver size, histopathology, and transcriptional profiles of liver were determined. Treatment with TDCIPP resulted in increased liver size and caused more aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Compared with the exposure to DOX, TDCIPP in the presence of DOX up-regulated the expression of genes relevant with salmonella infection and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. These results implied an occurrence of inflammatory reaction, which was sustained by the increase in the amount of infiltrated neutrophils in the liver of Tg(lyz:DsRed2) transgenic zebrafish larvae whose neutrophils were labelled by red fluorescent protein under the lysozyme C promoter. Furthermore, compared with the binary exposure of DOX and TDCIPP, treatment with a ternary mixture of TDCIPP, DOX and inflammatory response inhibitor (ketoprofen) significantly decrease the liver size and the amounts of neutrophils in the livers of kras and lyz double transgenic zebrafish larvae.

Edwardsiella piscicida, a severe fish pathogen, has been shown to encode several thioredoxins including TrxA, TrxC, and TrxH, but their biological roles remain unknown. In this study, we characterized TrxH of E. piscicida (named TrxH(Ep)) and examined its expression and function. TrxH(Ep) is composed of 125 residues and possesses typical thioredoxin H motifs. Expression of trxH(Ep) was upregulated under conditions of oxidative stress, iron starvation, low pH, and during infection of host cells. trxH(Ep) expression was also regulated by ferric uptake regulator (Fur), an important global regulatory of E. piscicida. Compared to the wild type TX01, a markerless trxH(Ep) in-frame mutant strain TX01trxH exhibited markedly compromised tolerance of the pathogen to hydrogen peroxide, acid stress, and iron deficiency. Deletion of trxH(Ep) significantly retarded bacterial biofilm growth and decreased resistance against serum killing. Pathogenicity analysis shows that the inactivation of trxH(Ep) significantly impaired the ability of E. piscicida to invade host cells, reproduce in macrophages, and infect host tissues. Introduction of a trans-expressed trxH gene restored the lost virulence of TX01trxH. There is likely to be a complex relationship of functional complementation or expression regulation between TrxH and another two thioredoxins, TrxA and TrxC, of E. piscicida.

Recent studies demonstrated that E. piscicida can invade and survive within multiple nonphagocytic cells, but the internalization mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we used HeLa cells as a nonphagocytic cell model to investigate the endocytic strategy used by the pathogenic E. piscicida isolate EIB202. Using a combination of optical and electron microscopy, we observed obvious membrane ruffles and F-actin rearrangements in HeLa cells after EIB202 infection. We also revealed that EIB202 internalization significantly depended on the activity of Na+/H+ exchangers and multiple intracellular signaling events related to macropinocytosis, suggesting that E. piscicida utilizes the host macropinocytosis pathway to enter HeLa cells. Further, using inhibitory drugs and shRNAs to block specific endocytic pathways, we found that a caveolin-dependent but not clathrin-dependent pathway is involved in E. piscicida entry and that its entry requires dynamin and membrane cholesterol. Together, these data suggest that E. piscicida enters nonphagocytic cells via macropinocytosis and caveolindependent endocytosis involving cholesterol and dynamin, improving the understanding of how E. piscicida interacts with nonphagocytic cells.        IMPORTANCE Bacterial internalization is the first step in breaking through the host cell defense. Therefore, studying the mechanism of bacterial internalization improves the understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of bacteria. In this study, the internalization process on nonphagocytic cells by Edwardsiella piscicida was evaluated. Our results showed that E. piscicida can be internalized into nonphagocytic cells via macropinocytosis and caveolin-mediated endocytosis, and that cholesterol and dynamin are involved in this process.

Water planners and managers have a unique opportunity to design and manage WCI to incorporate fish and, in so doing, reduce conflicts and optimise the benefits to both people and the ecosystem services upon which they depend. Results from rice-fish culture experimental trials in Myanmar's Ayeyarwady Delta are providing an evidence base for the importance of integrating fish into WCI, highlighting a range of both environmental and social benefits. By using less than 13% of paddy land area and through best management practices, existing rice productivity is sustained, alongside a 25% increase in economic returns for the same land area from fish. In addition, there are considerably more protein and micronutrients available from the fish produced in the system. Should these farming system innovations be adopted at scale, Myanmar stands to benefit from increased employment, incomes and nutritional value of farm plots (alongside associated reductions in pesticide pollution) and water use benefits.(1</SUP)",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  49,10.1071/MF19182     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),landscape approach;rice-fish systems;sustainable development;water managers;MEKONG DELTA;FARMING SYSTEMS;AQUACULTURE;VIETNAM;WATER;CHALLENGES;BANGLADESH;FISHERIES;ADOPTION;Oryza sativa,NA,NA,integrating fish into irrigation infrastructure projects in myanmar ricefish what if

A non-native strain of Phragmites australis (Common Reed; hereafter Phragmites) is aggressively invading North American wetlands, and the species has been shown to alter hydrology and impact aquatic organisms. Clear Creek Wildlife Management Area, in Kentucky, is heavily impacted by Phragmites invasion. Portions of the Wildlife Management Area with Phragmites were treated with herbicide to restore wetland flora, and in this study, we evaluated the effects of both the presence and management of Phragmites on wildlife populations and ecosystem function. We selected 3 locations (treated Phragmites, untreated Phragmites, and Phragmites-free) and surveyed each for water chemistry, wildlife populations, and stable-isotope signatures over a 2-y period. Water chemistry varied with the presence or absence of Phragmites, suggesting differences in nutrient cycling. Fish diversity did not differ among sites, but individual species varied in distribution and abundance between the Phragmites sites and the Phragmites-free site. Turtles showed significant differences in both diversity and body size based on the presence or absence of Phragmites, but not herbicide treatment. We detected no significant differences in frog diversity across treatments. We recorded 8 Kentucky Species of Greatest Conservation Need, but there were few differences in the distribution of these species across sites. Stable-isotope analysis revealed variation in food-web structure based on the presence of Phragmites. These results indicate that herbicides had little effect on fish and herpetofaunal communities in the short term, but potentially significant ecological changes may occur if Phragmites were eradicated. Our conclusions highlight the importance of monitoring habitat restoration to guide future management.

Therefore, the current study was undertaken to highlight the effects of penoxsulam exposure on O. niloticus and to evaluate the advantages of Chlorella vulgaris (CV) dietary supplementation against the induced effects. The 96-h lethal concentration 50 (LC50) penoxsulam value for O. niloticus was estimated at 8.948 mg/L by probit analysis in a static bioassay experiment. Next, 360 healthy fish were randomly allocated into 6 treatment groups. The Ti group served as the negative control and was fed a basal diet. The T2 group served as the positive control and was fed a basal diet supplemented with 10% CV. The fish in the T3 and T4 groups were exposed to 1/10 the 96-h LC50 of penoxsulam (0.8948 mg/L) and were fed the basal diet alone or the basal diet supplemented with 10% CV, respectively. The fish in the T5 and T6 groups were exposed to 1/5 the 96-h LC50 of penoxsulam (1.7896 mg/L) and fed the basal diet alone or the basal diet supplemented with 10% CV, respectively. Sub-acute penoxsulam exposure significantly altered hematological indices, as well as compromised the fish's immune defense mechanisms, including the phagocytic percentage, phagocytic index, nitric oxide production, immunoglobulin M levels and lysozyme, anti-trypsin and bactericidal activities subsequently decreasing O. niloticus's resistance to the Aeromonus sobria challenge and increasing disease symptoms and the mortality rate. Furthermore, sub-chronic penoxsulam exposure markedly altered growth performance, oxidant/antioxidant status and liver status and down-regulated the expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis-alpha (TNF-alpha). Interestingly, incorporating 10% CV into the diet protects fish against sub-acute penoxsulam-induced immunotoxicity via improvement of immune responses that increases the resistance against bacterial infection. Further, it improved the growth performance, oxidant/antioxidant status, liver status and markedly up-regulated immune-related gene expression, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, in the spleens of fish sub-chronically exposed to penoxsulam.

Non-target organisms are exposed to 2,4-D via several ways, which could produce toxic effects depending on the dose, frequency of exposure, and the host factors that influence susceptibility and sensitivity. An increasing number of experimental evidences have shown concerns about its presence/detection in the environment, because several investigations have pointed out its potential lethal effects on non-target organisms. In this review, we critically evaluated the environmental fate and behavior of 2,4-D along with its eco-toxicological effects on aquatic, plants and human life to provide concise assessment in the light of recently published reports. The findings demonstrate that 2,4-D is present in a low concentration in surface water of regions where its usage is high. The highest concentrations of 2,4-D were detected in soil, air and surface water surrounded by crop fields, which suggest that mitigation strategies must be implanted locally to prevent the entry of 2,4-D into the environment. A general public may have frequent exposure to 2,4-D due to its wide applications at home lawns and public parks, etc. Various in vivo and in vitro investigations suggest that several species (or their organs) at different trophic levels are extremely sensitive to the 2,4-D exposure, which may explain variation in outcomes of reported investigations. However, implications for the prenatal exposure to 2,4-D remain unknown because 2,4-D-induced toxicity thresholds in organism have only been derived from juveniles or adults. In near future, introduction of 2,4-D resistant crops will increase its use in agriculture, which may cause relatively high and potentially unsafe residue levels in the environment. The recent findings indicate the urgent need to further explore fate, accumulation and its continuous low level exposure impacts on the environment to generate reliable database which is key in drafting new regulation and policies to protect the population from further exposure.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  234     Total Times Cited:  253     Cited Reference Count:  257,10.1016/j.envint.2017.10.020     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"2,4-D;Phenoxy herbicide;Runoff;Risk assessment;Pesticide exposure;Environmental fate;NON-HODGKINS-LYMPHOMA;ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSE SYSTEM;CATFISH RHAMDIA-QUELEN;SOFT-TISSUE SARCOMA;JUNCUS-EFFUSUS L;OXIDATIVE STRESS;2,4-D HERBICIDE;COMMERCIAL FORMULATION;AGRICULTURAL SOILS;DEGRADING BACTERIA;Humanities;Humanism;Humans",NA,NA,potential impact of the herbicide 24dichlorophenoxyacetic acid on human and ecosystems

During infection by Phdp, AIP56 is systemically disseminated and induces apoptosis of macrophages and neutrophils, compromising the host phagocytic defence and contributing to the genesis of pathology. Although it is well established that the secretion of AIP56 is crucial for Phdp pathogenicity, the protein secretion systems operating in Phdp and the mechanism responsible for the extracellular release of the toxin remain unknown.

The two-component regulatory system EsrA-EsrB plays essential roles in pathogenesis through the type III and type VI secretion systems, and hemolysin production in E. piscicida. It is unclear whether other virulence-or stress response-associated genes are regulated by EsrA-EsrB. In this study, the proteomes of wild-type E. piscicida EIB202 and esrB mutant strains were compared to reveal EsrB regulon components after growth in Luria-Bertani broth (LB). Overall, the expression levels of nine genes exhibited significant changes, and five of them required the presence of EsrB, while others exhibited higher levels in the esrB mutant. The diverse functions of these proteins were identified, including amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress defense and energy production. Interestingly, superoxidase dismutase and thiol peroxidase were the most significantly down-regulated by EsrB. Furthermore, other reported reactive oxygen species (ROS) resistance-related genes were also down-regulated by EsrB as revealed by quantitative real-time. Compared with the wild-type and the complement strain esrB(+), Delta esrB displayed a significantly enhanced ROS resistance. These results demonstrated that EsrB plays important roles in the ROS resistance pathway in E. piscicida grown in LB conditions.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  32,10.1093/femsle/fnw269     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Edwardsiella piscicida;EsrB;comparative proteomics;ROS;TARDA;VIRULENCE;REVEALS;PATHOGENICITY;ADAPTATION;EXPRESSION;SEQUENCE;PHOP;Proteomics;Proteome;Reactive Oxygen Species;Oxygenators,NA,NA,comparative proteomic analysis unravels a role for esrb in the regulation of reactive oxygen species stress responses in <i>edwardsiella piscicida<i>

Today, Dublin Port is the busiest port in Ireland, handling 31 million tonnes of cargo a year and over 1.6 million ferry passengers and covering an area of 260 hectares in the centre of Dublin Bay, which encloses an area of about 296 km(2). Close to the port there are wetlands that are home to internationally important populations of birds and a range of coastal, intertidal and subtidal habitats, many of which are protected under EU and other legislation. The bay has been designated as a UNESCO Biosphere.        Dublin has a population of over a million people. The bay has high cultural value and is extensively used for recreation. There is a power station and a waste water treatment plant close to the port, together with oil storage, scrap metal recycling and cement manufacture. There were some shell and fin-fish fisheries in the past but commercial fishing is very limited today, although there are some important nursery areas for fish species harvested in the Irish Sea. Levels of contaminants have reduced in sediments due to reductions in shipbuilding, although concentrations of PAHs, metals and a range of pesticides are high in some areas. Dublin is a major oil trans-shipment port and oil exploration has been proposed in the bay, so there is risk of further oil contamination. Water quality is generally good, but sewage infrastructure and treatment capacity need further enhancement to sustain recent improvements. Sea level rise will bring increased risk of coastal flooding and threatens some of the wetland habitats. Additional sea-defences will further add to the extent of artificial structures along the foreshore. Dublin Port is set to expand and there are concerns over invasive species and climate change, particularly given lack of knowledge of potential impacts of invaders and the complex combined effects of multiple local and global stressors.        Coastal management is currently characterised by a sectoral approach; greater integration is needed. It is beginning to develop, partly due to recent EU directives and stakeholder engagement will be facilitated by the Dublin Bay Biosphere partnership. Having expanded at the expense of the coastal environment, Dublin City and Port are now beginning to reconnect with nature and with people who are increasingly recognising the value of natural capital and ecosystem services.

Fertilizers, and pesticides applied in excess by homeowners and landscapers can impair stormwater ponds and cause nuisance algae blooms, eutrophication and fish kills. They can also affect water quality in downstream creeks, and bays. To reduce the potential for nutrient-laden runoff to the aquatic environment, local and state governments passed different regulatory mechanisms that govern the use of BMPs and a fertilizer black out period. Interviews, surveys, and participant observation were used to gather quantitative and qualitative data in order to establish social indicator scores and evaluate knowledge and attitudes surrounding the fertilizer ordinance in a Master Planned community in Manatee County Florida. Results showed that most residents (69%) had not seen any materials related to the blackout period and lacked awareness of the components of the ordinance, including its restrictions on phosphorous and nitrogen applications and disposal of grass and landscape debris. The findings reveal the importance of social dimensions in sustainable stormwater management and suggest target areas for increasing awareness of the fertilizer ordinance and strengthening the link between social norms and environmental stewardship.

They are bio-accumulate in humans primarily via the diet, specifically by ingestion of foods that have high lipid content which are generally associated with foods of animal origin such as oils and fats and with fishery and dairy products. In Colombia the Ministry of Health and Social Protection which is the entity responsible for surveillance food conditions, has established maximum levels for dioxins and dl-PCBs in oils from animal and vegetable origins. Oils of vegetable and animal origin represent an appreciable intake in the country thus the presence of dioxins and dl-PCBs in these materials is a matter of concern because they can bioaccumulate in fat. In this contribution the levels of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs in olive, soybean, fish oil, butter and shrimp consumed in Colombia were determined using HRGC-HRMS and were compared with the maximum levels permitted in oil samples according to both the Colombian and European regulations. WHO-TEQ concentrations for PCDD/Fs and dioxin like PCBs ranged from 0.24 to 1.710 pgWHO-TEQ PCDD/F g(-1) of fat and from 0.050 to 3.000 pg WHO-TEQ PCB g(-1) of fat, respectively. As expected, fish oils and shrimp present the highest WHO-TEQ PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs values followed by butter and soybean oil sample, while the olive oil shows the lowest levels. In general, the vegetable oils show levels below the limits established by both the Colombian and European regulations. The levels from soybean oil found in this study were slightly higher than the threshold established both by the Commission Regulation European Union (EU) and the Colombian legislation, while fish oils showed concentrations above the European regulations.

In our study, we investigated the potential association between KLK3, AR, RNASEL, MSR1, and ELAC2 polymorphisms, expression patterns, exposure to environmental factors, and PCa in a Spanish cohort. Blood and fresh tissue samples were collected from 322 subjects with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >4ng/ml to determine their genotypes (RNASEL, MSR1, and ELAC2) and assess messenger ribonucleic acid expression levels (by quantitative amplification testing).        Main findings: Among clinical parameters, a 63.6% of patients with CC variants in rs11545302 (ELAC2) had PSA > 20ng/ml (P = 0.008), and rs486907 (RNASEL), with 52.8% of patients with CT variants with Gleason score > 7. Regarding TNM stage, patients with GG variants, rs4792311 (ELAC2) generally had stage 1 tumors. Genetic expression analysis revealed RNASEL (P = 0.007) was underexpressed in PCa tissue, whereas KLK3 (P = 0.041) was overexpressed. As to environmental factors, the intake of dried fruits (P = 0.036) and practice of sports (P = 0.024) revealed an effect in PCa. Moreover, environmental factors were observed to affect gene expression patterns. Thus, RNASEL (P = 0.018) and ELAC2 (P = 0.023) were found to be underexpressed in patients who ate processed foods frequently; MSR1 (P = 0.024) and AR (P = 0.004) were underexpressed in patients who did not practice sports; and KLK3 (P = 0.039; P = 0.046) underexpressed in patients exposed to dust and toxic products.        Conclusions: This is the first study to analyze the correlation between RNASEL, MSR1, and ELAC2 genotypes and messenger ribonucleic acid expression in PCa. RNASEL and KLK3 show different expression patterns in normal vs. tumor tissue, which supports their reported relevance in human cancer. The results obtained confirm that RNASEL plays a crucial role in PCa. Environmental factors such as exercise, exposure to toxic agents, and intake of processed foods are associated with PCa.

Various oxidative stress indicators such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels and protein carbonyl content, as well as antioxidant defenses parameters, such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH) and non-protein thiols (NP-SH) levels were studied, using the liver, kidney and gill tissues. Pendimethalin exposure increased lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation processes. There was significant inhibition in levels of GSH and NP-SH. The activity of antioxidant enzymes GST and CAT depleted in all the tissues in a dose dependent manner. The histopathological change in the gill showed necrosis and atrophy of primary and secondary gill lamellae. The tissue damages like degeneration of cytoplasm in hepatocytes, atrophy, formation of vacuoles, are some histopathological changes observed in the liver.

Fish fed with 5.0 mg/kg of (PhSe)(2) experienced a significant decrease in weight, length, and condition factor after 30 days and these parameters increased after 60 days. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and protein carbonyl (PC) decreased in the liver of silver catfish supplemented with (PhSe)(2) after 30 days at all concentrations, while after 60 days these parameters decreased in liver, gills, brain, and muscle. Supplementationwith (PhSe)(2) induced a decrease in catalase (CAT) activity fromliver only after 60 days of feeding. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) decreased at 5.0 mg/kg after 30 and 60 days and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was enhanced at 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg after 30 and 60 days. Silver catfish supplemented for 30 days showed a significant increase in liver glutathione S-transferase (GST) at 3.0 mg/kg, while after 60 days GST activity increased in liver at 1.5, 3.0, and 5.0 mg/kg and in gills at 3.0 and 5.0 mg/kg of (PhSe)(2). After 30 days, non-protein thiols (NPSH) did not change, while after 60 days NPSH increased in liver, gills, brain, and muscle. In addition, ascorbic acid (AA) levels after 30 days increased in liver at three concentrations and in gills andmuscle at 1.5 mg/kg, while after 60 days, AA increased at all concentrations in all and tissues tested. Thus, diet supplemented with (PhSe)(2) for 60 days could be more effective for silver catfish.

Thus, this study aims to evaluate for the first time seminal plasma N-glycosylation as a biomarker of environmental exposure in semen samples from 82 normozoospermic men and 84 men with abnormal semen parameters and compare it with genome damage measured by DNA fragmentation. We obtained information about chronic exposure to environmental factors from the self-reported questionnaire, and determined sperm DNA fragmentation by sperm chromatin dispersion, while N-glycans were characterized with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Based on previously published results, ten N-glycans were selected. Results show that the selected seminal plasma N-glycans were significantly associated with smoking, exposure to pesticides, air pollution, agents emitted during photocopying, alcohol consumption, and obesity. Some N-glycans showed a simultaneous association with DNA fragmentation, semen parameters, and environmental stressors. These subgroups of N-glycans are new potential candidates for biomonitoring of exposure to different environmental factors in men with semen abnormalities. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: T.

We first prepared and characterized a novel ferrocenediamide bridged bis(β-cyclodextrin) chiral stationary phase (FeCDP) to explore its chiral separation function. Its HPLC performance was systematically evaluated by basic, acidic, amphoteric and neutral chiral probes, including triazoles, profens, flavanones, amino acids and β-blocker drugs in reversed-phase and polar organic modes, respectively. The results showed that FeCDP successfully resolved 44 kinds of tested analytes (Rs = 0.66–4.38), of which 36 were completely separated (Rs ≥ 1.5). The best resolutions of different types, such as hexaconazole, ketoprofen, 3'-hydroxyflavanone, phenylalanine and arotinolol on FeCDP were reached at 3.06, 1.90, 4.38, 1.89 and 2.12 in a short time, respectively. Especially, FeCDP could completely resolve imazalil (Rs = 1.97), ketoprofen (Rs = 1.90), dansylated arginine (Dns-Arg, Rs = 1.50), pindolol (Rs = 1.42), bevantolol (Rs = 1.41), which were very difficult to be resolved on the conventional CDCSPs. However, under optimal condition, the ordinary CDCSP could only separate 19 analytes with low resolutions (Rs = 0.29–1.27). Compared with the reported similar stationary phases, the HPLC performance of FeCDP was also further improved. Based on the above comparison results, the satisfactory enantioselectivity of FeCDP may be mainly due to the fact that the “pseudo-cavity” composed of two CDs and a ferrocene diamide, could provide cooperative inclusion for analytes. Meanwhile, the large π-conjugated ferrocenediamide bridging group could also provide hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking, dipole–dipole and hydrophobic interactions, which may promote the chiral recognition effect of FeCDP. Bridge CD-CSP was a versatile chiral separation material in drugs analysis.

Museomics is the study of historical DNA acquired from museum specimens that allows researchers to answer myriad questions across many taxa. Museomics is an effective way to understand how populations have been affected by human and climate factors from a historic perspective. Here, our goal is to investigate changes in wild populations of two small carpenter bee species (Ceratina calcarata and C. dupla) across a 50-year time span. We sampled museum specimens and recent collections to determine their genetic diversity, population structure, effective population size, signatures of selection, and local adaptation. Both species displayed reduced genetic diversity and effective population size through time. We identified signatures of adaptation in both species across human-altered land use and climate change scenarios. We found signatures of selection in genes related to biochemical defense, insecticide, and thermal tolerance, which are consistent with the observed increase in agricultural land use development and rising temperatures over the past 50 years. Our findings suggest that these species are facing population inbreeding, possibly attributable to human land-use change and agrochemicals in their environment.

Fish were allocated into 6 groups: the control group was reared in clean water and fed with a commercial basal diet (CNT), two groups were fed with the basal diet supplemented with two different levels of GEO (GEO1 and GEO2, respectively), one group was intoxicated with 1/5 of ATZ 96-h lethal concentration 50 (1.39 mg/L) (ATZ group), and the remaining two groups were fed with the GEO-supplemented diets and concurrently exposed to 1.39 mg ATZ/L (GEO1+ATZ and GEO2+ATZ, respectively). The experiment lasted for 60 days. GEO supplementation exerted a significantly positive influence on fish growth, feed utilization, and hepatic antioxidant defense systems at both levels of supplementation. ATZ exposure significantly reduced fish survival rates and impaired fish growth and feed utilization, with the lowest final weights, weight gain, total feed intake, and the highest feed conversion ratio being recorded in the ATZ-intoxicated group. ATZ exposure caused significant changes in intestinal digestive enzyme activity (decreased lipase activity), hematological indices (decreased hemoglobin, packed cell volume, erythrocytes, and leukocytes), blood biochemical variables (decreased total proteins, albumin, globulins, and immunoglobulin M; increased total cholesterol, triglycerides, and cortisol), and hepatic oxidative/antioxidant indices (decreased glutathione level, superoxide dismutase and catalase enzyme activity and mRNA expression levels, and increased malondialdehyde content). Moreover, in the hepatic tissue of ATZ-intoxicated Nile tilapia, histopathological alterations and upregulated mRNA expression levels of stress- and apoptosis-related genes (Hsp70, caspase 3, and p53) were observed. GEO supplementation in ATZ-treated groups significantly attenuated the aforementioned negative effects, though some parameters did not reach the CNT values. These findings provide further and partly new evidence that sub-lethal ATZ toxicity induces reduced survivability, growth retardation, impaired digestive function, anemia, immunosuppression, hepatic oxidative stress damage, and overall increased stress level in Nile tilapia, and suggest that GEO supplementation may be useful for mitigating this toxicity and provide more general support to the productive performance and health status of this fish species.

Behavioral analysis showed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in distance swam, as well as a subsequent increase in CAT. Vertical and horizontal spatial behavioral use were affected under heat and pesticides co-exposure conditions. In 3- and 4-week(s) exposure groups, horizontal spatial behavioral use demonstrated elevated time spent in the lower third of the aquarium. Similarly, during 3- and 4-week(s) exposure (32°C control and 32°C high doses) vertical spatial behavioral use was found to increase time spent in the outermost edges of the aquarium. In all treatment groups, the final condition factor (KM) showed significant attenuation when compared to the initial KM. However, there was an unclear relationship between heat/pesticide co-exposure and growth most notably in 32°C high-dose groups. In addition, the expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 1A mRNA was significantly higher in pesticide-exposed groups.

Although adaptations associated with the winter morph enhance this invasive pest’s capacity to survive in cold climates, winter is still a natural population bottleneck. Since monitoring early spring populations is important for accurate population forecasts, understanding the winter morph’s response to olfactory cues may improve current D. suzukii management programs. In this study, a comparative transcriptome analysis was conducted to assess gene expression differences between the female heads of the two D. suzukii morphs, which showed significant differences in 738 genes (p ≤ 0.0001). Out of twelve genes related to olfaction determined to be differentially expressed in the transcriptome, i.e., those related to location of food sources, chemosensory abilities, and mating behavior, nine genes were upregulated in the winter morph while three were downregulated. Three candidate olfactory-related genes that were most upregulated or downregulated in the winter morph were further validated using RT-qPCR. In addition, behavioral assays were performed at a range of temperatures to confirm a differing behavioral response of the two morphs to food odors. Our behavioral assays showed that, although winter morphs were more active at lower temperatures, the summer morphs were generally more attracted to food odors. This study provides new insights into the molecular and behavioral differences in response to olfactory cues between the two D. suzukii morphs that will assist in formulating more effective monitoring and physiological-based control tools.

Metastatic tRCC occurring in young patients is more aggressive than that occurring in older patients, and there are still no effective therapies. Organoids can mimic original tissues and be assessed by high-throughput screening (HTS). We aimed to utilize patient-derived organoids and HTS to screen drugs that can be repurposed for metastatic tRCC with PRCC-TFE3 fusion. Methods: Tumor tissues were obtained from treatment-naïve metastatic tRCC patients who underwent surgery. Histopathology and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the tRCC. Organoids derived from the dissected tissues were cultured and verified by FISH and RNA-seq. HTS was performed to seek promising drugs, and potential mechanisms were explored by RNA-seq and cell-based studies. Results: We successfully established a metastatic tRCC organoid with PRCC-TFE3 fusion, a common fusion subtype, and its characteristics were verified by histopathology, FISH, and RNA-seq. An HTS assay was developed, and the robustness was confirmed. A compound library of 1816 drugs was screened. Eventually, axitinib, crizotinib, and JQ-1 were selected for further validation and were found to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. RNA-seq analyses of posttreatment organoids indicated that crizotinib induced significant changes in autophagy-related genes, consistent with the potential pathogenesis of tRCC. Conclusions: We established and validated organoids derived from tissues dissected from a patient with metastatic tRCC with PRCC-TFE3 fusion and achieved the HTS process for the first time. Crizotinib might be a targeted therapy worthy of exploration in the clinic for metastatic tRCC with PRCC-TFE3 fusion. Such organoid and HTS assays may represent a promising model system in translational research assisting in the development of clinical strategies. © 2022, The Author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: J.

Their frequency of sensitization has been widely assessed in US and other countries but poorly in Western Europe. This narrative review aims to provide a synthesis of data resulting in MEDLINE concerning allergic sensitization/asthma to pests as well as their related environmental/social risk factors, specifically in the European area. Data Sources: We performed a literature research in MEDLINE for clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Study Selections: We selected studies to the following key words: allergic sensitization, allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, cockroach, hypersensitivity, integrated pest management, material hardship, medication compliance, mouse, pest, poverty, rat, rodents. Results: Current evidence indicates that residence in poor and urban areas, exposure to outdoor/indoor pollutants and tobacco smoke, poverty, material hardship, poor-quality housing, differences in health care quality, medication compliance, health care access contribute to increased pest-related allergic sensitization and asthma morbidity. Conclusion: Further research should be done on many aspects of pest allergy such as a better characterization of allergens and epidemiological aspects. Relevant social actions should be carried out against poverty, healthcare disparities, psycho-social stress, poor compliance to therapy, with economic contributions to improve private and public living environments. Allergic sensitization to pests and pest-allergic respiratory diseases like asthma are ""paradoxical"" conditions, as they typically affect the poorest communities but can only be corrected by high-cost (diagnostic and preventive) interventions.

This observation suggests that ordered self-assembly can act as an AMP-regulating mechanism, and, vice versa, that human amyloids play a role in host defense against pathogens, as opposed to their common association with neurodegenerative and systemic diseases. Based on previous structural information on toxic amyloid peptides, we developed a sequence-based bioinformatics platform and, led by its predictions, experimentally identified 14 fibril-forming AMPs (ffAMPs) from living organisms, which demonstrated cross-β and cross-α amyloid properties. The results support the amyloid-antimicrobial link. The high prevalence of ffAMPs produced by amphibians and marine creatures among other species suggests that they confer unique advantageous properties in distinctive environments, potentially providing stability and adherence properties. Most of the newly identified 14 ffAMPs showed lipid-induced and/or time-dependent secondary structure transitions in the fibril form, indicating structural and functional cross-α/β chameleons. Specifically, ffAMP cytotoxicity against human cells correlated with the inherent or lipid-induced α-helical fibril structure. The findings raise hypotheses about the role of fibril secondary structure switching in regulation of processes, such as the transition between a stable storage conformation and an active state with toxicity against specific cell types. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Issues concerning the food system include the governance and economics of food production, its sustainability, the degree to which food is wastefully not consumed, how food production affects the natural environment, and the impact of food on individuals and the wider population’s health. The Special Report on Climate Change and Land submitted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that 25%–30% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are attributable to food production systems, which also result in significant pollution of air, soil, water, and to biodiversity losses. Farm to Fork (F2F) aims at resolving the issue of food sustainability and ensure support to the producers, that is, the farmers and the fishermen. It combines both regulatory and nonregulatory initiatives to attain its objectives of making the entire food chain from production to consumption more sustainable and neutral in its impact on the environment. F2F includes ambitious and concrete targets on pesticides, fertilizers, nutrient losses, antimicrobial resistance, and organic farming to be achieved by 2030. This chapter posits an overview on strategies accents of agricultural practices, crop metabolomes, case studies, and legislation carried out across the globe in preventing food loss and waste.

Thereby in this investigation, we examined the LC50 value of afidopyropen, an insecticide, in addition to selected behavioural and ACh, AChE activity of Cyprinus carpio fingerlings. Fingerlings were exposed to different concentrations of afidopyropen ranging from 0.4mg to 1.6 mg/L by the semi-static bioassay method. And it had been found to be 1.0 mg/L. The fish exposed to this insecticide showed remarkable behavioural abnormalities in a dose-dependent manner. ACh accumulation and AChE inhibition in carp (Cyprinus carpio) exposed to a different concentration for the period of 96 hrs caused a significant increase in the elevation of acetylcholine (ACh), and was related to a marked decrease in the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In comparison with the corresponding controls, AChE activity was significantly decreased, whereas the ACh accumulation was markedly elevated due to the interaction of AChE activity which remarks in excess accumulation of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junctions and synapses leading to make them more excitable for the behavioural changes due to impaired neurophysiology of the fish brain.

Mechanistic understanding is the key to successfully translating zebrafish findings to humans. In the present study, we used a well-known dopaminergic (DA) neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) as a model chemical to uncover the molecular pathways for observed DNT effects. To enhance the specificity of potential molecular targets, we restricted our exposure to a concentration that is nonteratogenic yet exhibits high DNT effects and an exposure window sensitive to MPTP. Our DNT assessment based on a battery of motor and social behavioral tests revealed an effective concentration of 1 μM and a sensitive window of 48-96 h postfertilization (hpf) for MPTP-induced hypoactivity. It is worth noting that this hypoactivity persisted into later larval development until 28 dpf. We observed increased cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and decreased ATP levels in larvae immediately after exposure at 96 hpf. Significant reductions of DA neurons were found in the retina at 72, 96, and 120 hpf. No visible deformity was found in motoneurons at 72, 96, and 120 hpf. Transcriptome analysis uncovered a novel pathway manifested by significant upregulation of genes enriched with erythropoiesis. Sensitive window exposure of MPTP and other DA neurotoxins rotenone and paraquat exhibited a concentration-dependent effect on transcriptional changes of embryonic hemoglobins and anemia. Given that anemia is a significant risk factor for Parkinson's disease and MPTP is known to cause parkinsonism in humans, we concluded that anemia resulting from dysregulation of primitive erythropoiesis during embryonic development might serve as a common mechanism underlying DA neurotoxin-induced DNT effects between zebrafish and humans.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: J.

Since 2010, approximately 150 km2 of conventional and 16 km2 of organic rice have been grown in Sacramento and Yolo Counties. These fields are often within mosquito flight-range of both rural towns and urban centers. Culex tarsalis are highly competent vectors of West Nile virus, and An. freeborni are aggressive, mammalophagic, nuisance biters. The Sacramento–Yolo Mosquito and Vector Control District provides mosquito control for the two counties in its jurisdiction. The principles of Integrated Pest Management are used to control mosquitoes in rice growing areas, relying upon a range of surveillance and control interventions. Larvae are controlled by limiting habitats that enable development of immature mosquitoes while balancing agricultural and wildlife needs, applying larvicides, and the use of Gambusia affinis (mosquitofish). Adult mosquitoes are controlled by ultra-low volume pesticide applications. The program was assessed for larval and adult mosquito control efficacy and areas of programmatic improvement identified.

Among them, named entity recognition has been a key technology for intelligent question-answering and knowledge graph construction in the fields of agricultural domain. It is also a high demand for the accurate identification of named entities. Furthermore, the Chinese named entity recognition can be confined to the location and semantic information of characters, due to the long length of agricultural entity and complex naming. Therefore, it is very necessary to improve the recognition performance in the process of named entity recognition, particularly for the sufficient capture of character position, contextual semantic features, and long-distance dependency information. In this study, a novel Chinese named entity recognition of agriculture was proposed using EmBERT-BiLSTM-CRF model. Firstly, the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) pre-trained language model was applied as the layer of word embedding. The context semantic representation of the model was then improved to alleviate the polysemy, when pre-training the depth bidirectional representation of word vectors. Secondly, the language masking of BERT was enhanced significantly, according to the characteristics of Chinese. An Entity-level Masking strategy was utilized to completely mask the Chinese entities in the sentence with the consecutive tokens. The Chinese semantics was then better represented to alleviate the bias caused by incomplete semantics. Thirdly, the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (BiLSTM) model was adopted to learn the semantic features of long-sequence using two LSTM networks (forward and backward), considering the contextual information in both directions at the same time. The long-distance dependency information of text was then captured during this time. Finally, the Conditional Random Field (CRF) was used to learn the labelling constraint in the training data. Among them, the learned constraint rules were used to detect whether the label sequence was legal during prediction. After that, the CRF also utilized the information of adjacent labels to output the globally optimal label sequence. Thus, the output of the model was a dependent label sequence, but an optimal sequence was considered the rules and order. A focal loss function was also used to alleviate the unbalanced sample distribution. A series of experiments were performed to construct the corpus of named entity recognition. As such, the corpus contained a total of 29 790 agricultural entities after BIO labelling, including 11 057 crops, 8 121 pesticides, 4 505 diseases, and 6 107 pest entities, in which the training, validation, and test set were divided, according to the ratio of 7:2:1. Four types of agricultural entities from the text were identified, including the crop varieties, pesticides, diseases, and insect pests, and then to label them. The experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the EmBERT-BiLSTM-CRF model for the four types of entities was 94.97%, and the F1 score was 95.93%. Which compared with the models based on BiLSTM-CRF and BERT-BiLSTM-CRF, the recognition performance of EmBERT-BiLSTM-CRF is significantly improved, proved that used pre-trained language model as the a word embedding layer can represent the characteristics of characters well and the Entity-level Masking strategy can alleviate the bias caused by incomplete semantics, thereby enhanced the Chinese semantic representation ability of the model, so that enabling the model to more accurately identify Chinese agricultural named entities. This research can not only provide arelatively high entity recognition accuracy for tasks such as agricultural intelligence question answering, but also offer new ideas for the identification of Chinese named entities in fishery, animal husbandry, Chinese medical, and biological fields. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

In this study, the effects of parental synergistic exposure to glyphosate and temperature increase on the next generation were investigated in a zebrafish model. For this purpose, adult zebrafish were exposed to 1 ppm and 5 ppm glyphosate for 96 h at four different temperatures (28.5, 29.0, 29.5, 30.0 °C). At the end of this period, some of the fish were subjected to the recovery process for 10 days. At the end of both treatments, a new generation was taken from the fish and morphological, physiological, molecular and behavioral analysis were performed on the offspring. According to the results, in parallel with the 0.5-degree temperature increase applied to the parents with glyphosate exposure, lower survival rate, delay in hatching, increased body malformations and lower blood flow and heart rate were detected in the offspring. In addition, according to the results of whole mouth larva staining, increased apoptosis, free oxygen radical formation and lipid accumulation were detected in the offspring. Moreover, it has been observed that the temperature increases to which the parents are exposed affects the light signal transmission and serotonin pathways in the offspring, resulting in more dark/light locomotor activity and increased thigmotaxis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: S.B.

Through a critical discourse analysis of submissions to the public consultation concerning the European Union’s Farm to Fork Strategy, we examine the role of public consultations as a democratic process and the extent to which their non-deliberative nature advances solutions to contentious and complex challenges. We explore different perspectives around the future of agricultural pesticide use and find evidence of polarised submissions. Those in favour of reducing pesticides tend to argue on the grounds of planetary and human health, emphasizing that alternatives already exist and resistance to change results from a lack of political will. Those arguing against setting further restrictions on pesticide use, focus on food security and the lack of viable alternatives. Taking inspiration from Arnstein’s (1969) [A ladder of citizen participation. Journal of the American Institute of Planners, 35(4), 216–224] ladder of participation and Fishkin’s (2011) [Making deliberative democracy practical. Chapter 4. In When the people speak: Deliberative democracy and public consultation (pp. 95–105] questions around what makes deliberative democracy practical, we argue that consultations are not merely ‘tokenistic’, but do appear to be inadequate where discourses are strongly polarised, as they are not sufficiently inclusive or thoughtful, using scientific findings only where these support pre-existing views.

Vacuum samples (<80 µm fraction) were analysed for over 200 synthetic organic compounds and metal(loid)s. Spearman rank correlations between contaminant concentrations in dust and presence of children and pets, types of flooring, heating styles and other characteristics suggested a number of indoor sources, pointing to future research directions. Numerous synthetic organics were significantly associated with reported use of room deodorizers and with the presence of cats in the home. Hardwood flooring, which is a manufactured wood product, emerged as a source of metal(loid)s, phthalates, organophosphate flame retardants/plasticizers, and obsolete organochlorine pesticides such as ∑DDT (but not halogenated flame retardants). Many metal(loid)s were significantly correlated with flame-retardant compounds used in building materials and heating systems. Components of heating appliances and heat distribution systems appeared to contribute heat-resistant chemicals and alloys to settled dust. Carpets displayed a dual role as both a source and repository of dust-borne contaminants. Contaminant loadings (<80 µm fraction) were significantly elevated in heavily carpeted homes, particularly those located near industry. Depending on the chemical (and its source), the results show that increased dust mass loading may enrich or dilute chemical concentrations in dust.

The isolated strain was identified as Pseudoalteromonas ruthenica. In vivo experiments were conducted with P. ruthenica-immersed larvae and P. ruthenica-enriched Artemia fed to adult zebrafish. Disease tolerance of larval zebrafish against Edwardsiella piscicida was demonstrated by 66.34% cumulative per cent survival (CPS) in the P. ruthenica-exposed group, which was higher than the CPS of the control (46.67%) at 72 h post challenge (hpc). Heat-stressed larvae had 55% CPS in the P. ruthenica-immersed group, while the control had 30% CPS at 60 hpc. Immune-stress response gene transcripts (muc5.1, muc5.2, muc5.3, alpi2, alpi3, hsp70, and hsp90a) were induced, while pro-inflammatory genes (tnfα, il1b, and il6) were downregulated in P. ruthenica-immersed larvae compared to the control. This trend was confirmed by low pro-inflammatory and high stress-responsive protein expression levels in P. ruthenica-exposed larvae. Adult zebrafish had higher CPS (27.2%) in the P. ruthenica-fed group than the control (9.52%) upon E. piscicida challenge, suggesting increased disease tolerance. Histological analysis demonstrated modulation of goblet cell density and average villus height in the P. ruthenica-supplemented group. Metagenomics analysis clearly indicated modulation of alpha diversity indices and the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in the P. ruthenica-supplemented zebrafish gut. Furthermore, increased Firmicutes colonisation and reduced Bacteroidetes abundance in the gut were observed upon P. ruthenica supplementation. Additionally, this study confirmed the concentration-dependent increase of colony dispersion and macrophage uptake upon mucin treatment. In summary, P. ruthenica possesses remarkable functional properties as a probiotic that enhances host defence against diseases and thermal stress. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: C.

This study investigated the presence and antimicrobial activities of bioactive peptides in seven selected plants from the Rubiaceae, Apocynaceae, and Euphorbiaceae families. Methods: The reversed-phase solid-phase extraction was used to obtain the peptide-rich fractions from the crude extracts of the plants, and the circular peptides were chemically detected by a modified G-250 spray on a developed TLC plate. The peptide fraction and crude extracts were screened for their antimicrobial activities using the broth microdilution method. The rate of kill study was conducted for the peptide fractions Euphorbia hirta and Nauclea diderichii Results: The study revealed Nauclea diderichii peptide-rich fraction as the most potent on the tested strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and fungi (MIC = 7.8, 15.63-62.5, and 7.8 μg/mL respectively). Euphorbia hirta and Nauclea diderichii peptide fractions exhibited bactericidal activity (MIC index ≤4, and >3Log10 reduction of initial inoculum) and have a broad spectrum of activity, which further validates their ethnomedicinal use in the management of diverse infectious diseases, including enteric and respiratory tract infections. The peptide fractions of all the plants are more potent than the crude extracts.

Indeed, bacteria have developed the SOS response which facilitates the evolution of resistance under genotoxic stress. The transcriptional repressor, LexA, plays a key role in this response. Mutation of LexA to a non-cleavable form that prevents the induction of the SOS response sensitizes bacteria to antibiotics. Achieving the same inhibition of proteolysis with small molecules also increases antibiotic susceptibility and reduces drug resistance acquisition. The availability of multiple LexA crystal structures, and the unique Ser-119 and Lys-156 catalytic dyad in the protein enables the rational design of inhibitors. Methods: We pursued a binary approach to inhibit proteolysis; we first investigated β-turn mimetics, and in the second approach we tested covalent warheads targeting the Ser-119 residue. We found that the cleavage site region (CSR) of the LexA protein is a classical Type II β-turn, and that published 1,2,3-triazole compounds mimic the β-turn. Generic covalent molecule libraries and a β-turn mimetic library were docked to the LexA C-terminal domain using molecular modelling methods in FlexX and CovDock respectively. The 133 highest-scoring molecules were screened for their ability to inhibit LexA cleavage under alkaline conditions. The top molecules were then tested using a RecA-mediated cleavage assay. Results: The β-turn library screen did not produce any hit compounds that inhibited RecA-mediated cleavage. The covalent screen discovered an electrophilic serine warhead that can inhibit LexA proteolysis, reacting with Ser-119 via a nitrile moiety. Discussion: This research presents a starting point for hit-to-lead optimisation, which could lead to inhibition of the SOS response and prevent the acquisition of antibiotic resistance.

Importantly, it is one of peripheral mucosal immune organs of fish. The mucosal immune response of gill is the hot research topic. In this paper, we firstly analyzed the structure and features of gill. Then, we summarized the gene expressions and molecular functions of molecules involved in the innate immunity and adaptive immunity in gill. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including NK-lysins, β-defensins, piscidins and hepcidins, are important innate immune molecules in fish gill, which can directly inhibit or kill a variety of pathogenic microorganisms. Fish type I interferon (IFN) and type II IFN in gill can be up-regulated by bacteria, viruses and parasites, indicating their important roles in gill immune response against pathogens. The interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17 and heterodimer ILs are mainly expressed in gill, but possess distinct time-dependent patterns following pathogen invasion. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important pattern recognition receptors of fish. The TLR1-4, TLR7, TLR9, TLR12, TLR18, TLR21-22 are highly expressed in gill and up-regulated by pathogens. Fish possess similar complement molecules as mammals, and these complement molecules are highly expressed in gill and significantly up-regulated during pathogen invasion. T-cell receptors (TCRs) and immunoglobulins are the main adaptive immune molecules in gill. Similar to mammals, fish have four types of TCRs (TCRα, TCRβ, TCRγ and TCRδ). These four TCRs are induced by bacteria or parasites in gill. Three types of immunoglobulins (IgM, IgD, and IgZ/T) exist in gill. IgM and IgD in gill are involved in the recognition and binding of specific antigens, while IgZ/T is responsible for the mucosal immune response. Lastly, the effects of chemical factors (such as heavy metals, pesticides), biotic factor (such as bacteria, virus, parasites), nutriments, and vaccines on the structures of gill were analyzed. Heavy metals (such as copper, arsenic, mercury), pesticides, and pathogens invasion can destroy the normal structure of gills. Nutriments and vaccines have positive regulatory effects on the immune function of fish gill. This study may provide guidance for further study of the functional role and response mechanism of gill in fish mucosal immune response, and provide theoretical basis for the research and development of immune prevention and control strategies for pathogenic diseases of teleost. © 2023 Shanghai Ocean University.

Rapid detection of such contaminants is needed to keep us safe from being affected. For over three decades, immunoassay (IA) technology has been used for the detection of contaminants in seafood products. However, limitations inherent to antibody generation against small molecular targets that cannot elicit an immune response, along with the instability of antibodies under ambient conditions greatly limit their wider application for developing robust detection and monitoring tools, particularly for non-biomedical applications. As an alternative, aptamer-based biosensors (aptasensors) have emerged as a powerful yet robust analytical tool for the detection of a wide range of analytes. Due to the high specificity of aptamers in recognising targets ranging from small molecules to large proteins and even whole cells, these have been suggested to be viable molecular recognition elements (MREs) in the development of new diagnostic and biosensing tools for detecting a wide range of contaminants including heavy metals, antibiotics, pesticides, pathogens and biotoxins. In this review, we discuss the recent progress made in the field of aptasensors for detection of contaminants in seafood products with a view of effectively managing their potential human health hazards. A critical outlook is also provided to facilitate translation of aptasensors from academic laboratories to the mainstream seafood industry and consumer applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: B.K.

Darr College of Agriculture, Missouri State University, 9740 Red Spring Road, Mountain Grove, 65711, MO, United States","The codling moth, Cydia pomonella L. (Tortricidae), is a major pest of apples, potentially causing annual losses exceeding USD62 billion globally. Growers have limited options for combatting the codling moth. Sprays with azinphos-methyl have been banned in the European Union, Turkey, and the USA. To be effective, Bacillus thuringiensis or Carpocapsa pomonella must be ingested in large quantities, and the fruit is damaged before the larvae die. Mating disruption or an attract-and-kill strategy does not resolve problems caused by the migration of moths from adjacent areas or insecticide resistance. Discouraging neonates from burrowing into the fruit with feeding deterrents or repellents of plant origin may become a new strategy. This paper presents a list of twenty-three plants and six secondary metabolites preventing apple infestation by codling moth neonates. Some of these plant extracts or oils (Alium sativum, Tanacetum vulgare, Atremisia arborescens, Ginkgo biloba) showed deterrence exceeding 95% in comparison to controls. The prospects of codling moth control with botanicals are discussed, and further studies on these substances are suggested. In conclusion, the author states that twenty-nine plant-originated materials have great potential in organic apple protection.

To enhance and preserve these overexploited species, the effect of provenance on the chemical composition of essential oils and antimicrobial activity against human pathogens were studied. Essential oils (EO) obtained by hydrodistillation from the flowering tops of thyme species were analyzed by GC-SM. The determination of minimum inhibitory (MIC), bactericidal (MBC), and fungicide (MFC) concentrations of EO were studied by microplate microdilution. The correlation between the chemical composition of EO and antimicrobial properties were evaluated using R software. The samples studied gave variable yields, ranging from 0.70 ± 0.03% to 4.12 ± 0.21%. The main constituents of Thymus vulgaris harvested from the municipality of El Hammam are carvacrol (68.8%), γ-terpinene (11.5%), and p-cymene (3.9%), while borneol (41.3% and 31.7%) and carvacrol (14.6% and 9.8%) are the most abundant in Thymus satureioides of the communes of Tata and Tigrigra respectively. For Thymus zygis, the results revealed the dominance of carvacrol (51.7% and 57.5%) for the municipalities of Tigrigra and Ain Aghbal, thymol (47.1% and 42.1%) for the municipalities of Bensmim and Timahdite respectively. These chemical profiles have similarities, but also reveal differences from the results given in the literature. In addition, the essential oils most active towards the microorganisms evaluated were those of Thymus vulgaris, followed by Thymus zygis and Thymus satureioides. These EO have very powerful MIC (MIC ⩽ 300 μg/ml) against Gram-negative bacteria, and in particular, concerning Enterobacters cloacae, Citrobacter koseri, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Thymus zygis EO is the most active on candidates compared to Thymus vulgaris and Thymus satureioides EO, except Candida dubliniensis which was inhibited by Thymus satureioides EO from the commune of Azrou with a MIC = 18.75 μg/ml. The correlation determined between the major components and MIC showed that phenols have the strongest positive effects on antimicrobial properties, followed by terpenes and non-aromatic alcohols. In addition, different sensitivities of pathogens to chemical families have been observed against Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter koseri, Candida parapsilosis, Staphylococcus aureus multiresistant, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Aspergillus niger. Our results support the idea that these oils could be very useful in flavoring, food preservation, as well as a source of antimicrobial agents of great power against multidrug-resistant strains. © 2022 The Author(s)","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: A.

An increase of EROD activity (LOEC = 1 mg l(-1)), indicating the involvement of this enzyme in fenitrothion biotransformation, and a negative and significant correlation between EROD activity and swimming velocity were also found, suggesting that the two findings may somehow be related. Furthermore, results show a significant induction of SOD (LOEC = 0.13 mg l(-1)) without LPO increase, suggesting that the enzyme is preventing oxidative stress damage.

The number of larvae that engaged in cannibalistic activity within the initial 30 min observation period was significantly higher for controls compared with all experimental treatments. When stalking, striking, and consumption times were examined together (a measure of overall response time), concentration had a significant effect with the 10 mu g/L group taking significantly longer to cannibalize than the control group.

Since steroid hormone biosynthesis is regulated through neurotransmission of the central nervous system (CNS), studies were conducted to determine whether neurotransmitters that control hormone biosynthesis could be affected after diuron and diuron metabolites treatment. As the same neurotransmitters and steroid hormones regulate behavioral outcomes, aggression was also evaluated in male Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Male tilapias were exposed for 10 days to waterborne diuron and the metabolites 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA), 3,4-dichlorophenyl-N-methylurea (DCPMU), at nominal concentrations of 100 ng L-1. In contrast to Diuron, DCA and DCPMU significantly diminished plasma testosterone concentrations (39.4% and 36.8%, respectively) and reduced dopamine levels in the brain (47.1% and 44.2%, respectively). In addition, concentrations of the stress steroid, cortisol were increased after DCA (71.0%) and DCPMU (57.8-%) exposure. A significant decrease in aggressive behavior was also observed in animals treated with the metabolites DCA (50.9%) and DCPMU (68.8%). These results indicate that biotransformation of diuron to active metabolites alter signaling pathways of the CNS which may impact androgen and the stress response as well as behavior necessary for social dominance, growth, and reproduction.

The Middle Is. colony in the western end of Lake Erie showed high relative amounts of the higher chlorinated PCB congeners, due to continuing contamination from the Detroit R., or resuspension of contaminated sediments. PCDD/F patterns in the same colonies were dominated by 1,2,3,6,7,8 HxCDD and 1,2,3,7,8 PeCDD in lakes Erie, Huron and Superior while Lake Ontario patterns were dominated by 2,3,7,8 TCDD.

We also focused on three physiological traits from the cellular up to the whole individual level showing metabolic status of fish (protein concentration in liver and muscle, hepatosomatic index, and Fulton's condition factor). Individual thermal stress and low concentrations of pesticides decreased the sediment reworking activity of fish and entrained metabolic compensation with global depletion in energy stores.

This is supported with data on concurrent population fluxes of extrabasin North American bald eagle populations and the European white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicillus) where the same chemicals were produced and released. Organochlorine chemicals appear as a unique stress on Great Lakes bald eagle populations when compared with stresses on successful populations of bald eagles continentwide. Shoreline birds bear significantly higher concentrations of these persistent toxics than inland birds. Association between contaminated prey and elevated concentrations of PCBs, DDT, and DDE in Great Lakes bald eagles are presented. A fledging ratio is used to support the hypothesis that maternal prezygotic exposure affects the viability of embryos and chicks. The ratio of the mean number of fledglings per successful territory to the mean number of fledglings per active territory, when the numerator is greater than 1.4, provides an index of exposure to contaminants by parental animals and affected offspring. When the ratio is greater than 2, parental exposure to organochlorine chemicals should be considered. The adverse effects of prezygotic exposure to the same contaminants in other animal species dependent upon Great Lakes fish, and extrabsin bald eagle populations dependent upon contaminated fish, provide consistency to the argument. The mechanism of action of the organochlorine chemicals further strengthens the causal argument indicting DDT, DDE, and PCBs. A strong association between DDT/DDE and bald eagle reproductive success is provided. However, the role of PCBs is not ruled out. Only data for total PCB concentrations in bald eagle tissue are available, and until specific PCB congeners are quantified there will be uncertainty concerning PCB's role in the Great Lakes bald eagle's lack of success.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  88     Total Times Cited:  98     Cited Reference Count:  181,10.1080/15287399109531537     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ARYL-HYDROCARBON HYDROXYLASE;HEPATOCYTE INTERCELLULAR COMMUNICATION;POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS PCBS;WHALES DELPHINAPTERUS-LEUCAS;LIVER-TUMOR PROMOTERS;DIBENZO-PARA-DIOXINS;ST LAWRENCE ESTUARY;ORGANOCHLORINE PESTICIDES;RAT-LIVER;MOUSE HEPATOCYTES;Alopecia,NA,NA,epidemiology of greatlakes bald eagles

Exposure of embryos at 1 h post fertilization (hpf) to 3-5 mu M Cd or 30-100 mu M PQ for 9 h induced a 2-3-fold increase of oxidative stress, while a 6.5-fold increase of oxidative stress was induced by 200 mu M PQ Real-time RT-PCR detected a down-regulated xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC) and an up-regulated UV-DDB2 gene expression in mildly-stressed embryos, whereas 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) gene expression increased with PQ exposure levels. NER of UV-damaged DNA was enhanced in weakly oxidant-stressed embryos as shown by a transcription-based DNA repair assay, yet repair activities of both UV and cisplatin-damaged DNA were inhibited in embryos exposed to 200 mu M PQ. Band shift assay showed a suppression of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) binding activity in all stressed embryos. In contrast, (6-4) photoproduct (6-4PP) recognition activity was weakly stimulated except in embryos exposed to 200 AM PQ revealing a link of NER capacity to 6-4PP binding. Our results showed that Cd and PQ imposed similar inducing effects on UV-DDB2 gene expression, NER of UV-damaged DNA and 6-4PP binding activity in zebrafish embryo under low levels of oxidative stress and NER capacity could be inhibited if the intensity of oxidative stress increased to a critical level.

These areas are generally ideal for amphibians due to the presence of small, ephemeral water bodies. While Roundup (TM) has been shown to have lethal effects on many species of amphibians, effects on behaviour and sensory perception have yet to be considered. Here, we exposed wood frog tadpoles to a sub-lethal concentration of Roundup (TM) and showed that the ability of tadpoles to respond to injured conspecific cues, an important source of information regarding local predation risk, was impaired. Subsequent experiments revealed that impaired responses likely result from a chemical reaction between the Roundup (TM) and the cues and that tadpoles chronically exposed to Roundup (TM) had reduced basal movement rates compared with unexposed tadpoles. Our data demonstrate that environmentally-relevant concentrations of RoundupTm can drastically alter movement and anti-predator responses of tadpoles, with potential negative consequences for the population.

One potential adverse interaction could involve pesticide-induced dysregulation of DNA repair pathways, resulting in greater numbers of DNA photoadducts from UVB exposure. In the present study, we investigated the interactive effects of UVB radiation and two common pesticides (endosulfan and alpha-cypermethrin) on induction of DNA photo-adducts and expression of DNA damage and repair related genes in African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) embryos. We examined 13 genes that are, collectively, involved in stress defense, cell cycle arrest, nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair, mismatch repair, DNA repair regulation, and apoptosis. We exposed X. laevis embryos to 0, 25, and 50 mu g/L endosulfan or 0, 2.5, and 5.0 mu g/L alpha-cypermethrin for 96 h, with environmentally relevant exposures of UVB radiation during the last 7 h of the 96 h exposure. We measured the amount of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and mRNA abundance of the 13 genes among treatments including control, pesticide only, UVB only, and UVB and pesticide co-exposures. Each of the co-exposure scenarios resulted in elevated CPD levels compared to UVB exposure alone, suggesting an inhibitory effect of endosulfan and alpha-cypermethrin on CPD repair. This is attributed to results indicating that alpha-cypermethrin and endosulfan reduced mRNA abundance of XPA and HR23B, respectively, to levels that may affect the initial recognition of DNA lesions. In contrast, both pesticides increased transcript abundance of CSA and MUTL. In addition, mRNA abundance of HSP70 and GADD45 alpha were increased by endosulfan and mRNA abundance of XPG was increased by alpha-cypermethrin. XPC, HR23B, XPG, and GADD45 alpha exhibited elevated mRNA concentrations whereas there was a reduction in MUTL transcript concentrations in UVB-alone treatments. It appeared that even though expression of XPC and CSA were induced by exposure to UVB or pesticides, XPA was the limiting factor in the NER pathway. Our results suggest that pesticides may increase the accumulation of UVB-induced DNA photo-adducts and one likely mechanism is the alteration of critical NER gene expression. The present study provides important implications for evaluating the combined risks of pesticide usage and potentially increasing UVB radiation in aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ATZ is one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and a known endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). The behavior of sailfin mollies is well documented in the scientific literature. Moreover, they are ecologically important indicators of environmental health, widely distributed among the mangroves along the Gulf Coast of the Southeastern US where significant amounts of ATZ are introduced via runoff and storm water drainage from coastal households, businesses, and farms. Four sets of experiments designed to assess ATZ's impact on various aspects of male and female reproductive behavior, aggression, anxiety, and boldness were conducted following 12 weeks of exposure to 1 or 15 ppb water-borne ATZ, along with a no-exposure control group. Results indicated that the behavior of ATZ-exposed individuals differed from those of controls: ATZ exposure affected which stimulus fish (a male vs. a female) subject females preferred to associate with while also affecting female strength of preference for males of larger body size and their sexual receptivity to conspecific males in general. ATZ-exposed males also showed reduced overall responsiveness to conspecific stimuli and directed significantly less aggression toward their mirror image compared with controls. Finally, ATZ exposure affected multiple aspects of male and female behavior that are often used as proxies for boldness and anxiety. Overall, ATZ exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behaviors attributed to sexual receptivity, mate choice and motivation to mate, aggression, as well as boldness and anxiety.

Particularly during the larval stages, when these animals are restricted to small, transient ponds, exposure to high concentrations of pesticides is inevitable in agricultural areas. Given that pesticide application increases during the summer, which coincides with the reproductive season and the occurrence of most neotropical tadpoles in their natural environment, strong indications exist that tadpoles are developing in contaminated ponds. Fipronil is one of the primary insecticides used in sugarcane cultivation in Brazil, and little is known about its toxic effects on non-target organisms such as tadpoles. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of fipronil and its metabolites on oxidative stress in Eupemphix nattereri tadpoles after exposure in water and sediment at concentrations of 35, 120 and 180 mu g kg(-1). We assessed the activities of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione S-transferase (GST), glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and catalase (CAT) and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA). The results showed that fipronil has an inherent capacity to cause oxidative stress in tadpoles, as evidenced by a decrease in CAT activity and an increase in lipid peroxidation levels at all concentrations tested. Fipronil sulfone also produced elevated MDA levels at two of the tested concentrations and increased G6PDH activity in tadpoles exposed to the highest concentration of this metabolite but did not affect MDA levels.

Furthermore, we showed that fish fed with N. sativa-enriched diets at 0.25, 0.5 and 1% for 60 days coped better with glyphosate exposure than control fish and displayed more stable levels of biochemical serum parameters (total protein, albumin, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein LDL), cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein HDL), higher levels of immune defences (lysozyme and immunoglobulin) and higher antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase SOD, glutathione peroxidase GPx) than control fish. Fish fed with all enriched diets also displayed lower lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde MDA), lower metabolic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase ALT, aspartate aminotransferase AST and alkaline phosphatase ALP) levels in blood serum and lower cortisol levels than control fish.

In adults, exposure to the pesticide did not lead to changes in free swimming parameters. However, a marked decrease of swimming endurance was observed at all experimental treatments, although probably not in consequence of energetic depletion, since baseline blood glucose levels and condition factor were similar at all conditions. Furthermore, zebrafish adults did not show their natural preference for the dark environment.

Parasitism, however, has yet to be fully integrated into research on the ecology of fear, despite it having direct negative and often lethal effects on hosts and being the most common life history strategy on the planet. This might at least be partly due to the traditional, but untested, assumption that anti-parasite responses are weak relative to anti-predator responses. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the activity and location responses of Bufo americanus tadpoles to one of six chemical cues: water; cercariae of Echinostoma trivolvis, a trematode which infects and can kill amphibians; a snail releasing E. trivolvis cercariae; an uninfected snail; food; or conspecific alarm chemicals signaling predation. There is also literature encouraging research on the context dependency and pollution-induced disruption of fear responses. Consequently, before quantifying responses to the chemical cues, half of the B. americanus were exposed to the herbicide atrazine (201 mu g/l for 4 days), a reported inhibitor of fear responses in fish. Tadpoles were attracted to food, were indifferent to an uninfected snail, avoided alarm chemicals, and exhibited avoidance and elevated activity in response to a snail shedding cercariae and cercariae alone. Atrazine had no detectable effects on B. americanus' responses to the tested cues despite the use of a higher concentration and longer exposure duration than has been repeatedly shown to inhibit chemical cue detection in fish. The magnitude of anti-parasite and anti-predator responses were qualitatively similar, suggesting that the fear of disease and its ecological consequences could be comparable to that of predation. Consequently, we call for a greater integration of parasites into research on the ecology of fear and trait-mediated indirect effects.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  84     Total Times Cited:  100     Cited Reference Count:  65,10.1007/s00442-008-1208-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alarm chemical;Atrazine;Bufo americanus;Trait-mediated indirect effects;Trematode;PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS;NON-INJURED CONSPECIFICS;FROGS RANA-CLAMITANS;RED-SPOTTED NEWT;SALAR L.

At times, these applications tend to be more effective at the onset of fish spawning in spring: however, they can cause conflicts between anglers and lake management personnel assigned to control excessive SAV. We evaluated the direct application of an aquatic herbicide (Aquathol K [dipotassium salt of endothall]) on the nest behavior and fidelity of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and measured the subsequent reproductive success of these fish. Endothall was applied to achieve a shoreline concentration of 5 mg/L of water volume in 0.1-ha ponds (3 mg/L whole-pond concentration). It was applied directly on nests in three ponds in March 2005, 2006, and 2007 when largemouth bass initiated spawning; spawning activity was monitored over 14-15 d. Using similar techniques, we applied water to another three ponds where largemouth bass were nesting. For all 3 years, endothall did not affect nest guarding by largemouth bass, and nest fidelity was similar to that for ponds treated with water. Endothall concentrations declined about sevenfold over 21 d but persisted in the water during spawning. Electrofishing of young largemouth bass 2-3 months after spawning showed that their relative abundance and size were similar among the ponds treated with endothall and the control ponds. Similarly, the density and biomass of age-0 largemouth bass did not vary between treatments for fish killed with rotenone in late August each year. Managers can use these results to address angler concerns about endothall application during largemouth bass spawning and thereby lessen conflicts over efforts to control excessive SAV.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  26,10.1577/M08-041.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),AQUATIC VEGETATION;LAKE SEMINOLE;POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS;ANGLER ATTITUDES;HYDRILLA;FISHERY;MANAGEMENT;HERBICIDES;REMOVAL;Reproductive Behavior,NA,NA,impacts of endothall applications on largemouth bass spawning behavior and reproductive success

Compared with CTR, liver of fish exposed to POEA 2 and POEA 3 showed increased activity of 7 ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and increased content of glutathione, whereas the activity of glutathione-S-transferase was diminished. On the other hand, fish of the group POEA 1 showed an increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase and in the occurrence of lipid peroxidation. Fish exposed to POEA 3 presented increased hepatic activity of glutathione peroxidase and reduced plasma cortisol. The exposure to POEA at all concentrations tested caused an increase in plasma lactate and a decrease in the hepatic activity of catalase, in the number of red blood cells and in hemoglobin content The comet assay used for analyzing DNA damage in blood cells indicated the genotoxicity of the surfactant at all concentrations tested.

However, whilst both SGEs and SA alleles are recognized as common and potent sources of genomic conflict, the realization that SGEs can also generate sexually antagonistic selection and contribute to sexual conflict in addition to generate sexual selection is largely overlooked.

The experiments were divided in acute (one dose, 5-day) and sub-chronic (3 doses, 15-day). Control groups received an equal volume of PBS or canola oil (1 ml kg-1). The three tested contaminants altered AChE activity in brain and muscle in similar ways; the mixtures antagonized the increase evoked by the contaminants alone. BaP and TBT increased GSH content and mixtures reduced it. GPx activity was increased by DDT and TBT in the 15-day experiment and reduced by the mixtures. BaP increased GST activity in sub-chronic experiment while TBT reduced it in the acute experiment. BaP/TBT increased GST activity compared to all groups; the other mixtures reduced it compared to BaP or DDT in the 5-day experiment. BaP, DDT and TBT increased delta-ALAd activity mainly in acute exposure; the mixtures also increased delta-ALAd compared to DDT or TBT in 5 and 15-day. BaP, TBT and BaP/DDT decreased LPO in the acute experiment. In the subchronic experiment DDT/TBT increased LPO when compared to TBT. None of the contaminants alone altered PCO, but all mixtures increased it compared to one or another contaminant. Contaminants isolated had a more acute effect in ALT plasma level; their lowest dose, which had no effect alone, in combination has led to an increase of this enzyme, especially after 15 days. DDT increased AST in the acute and sub-chronic experiments, while TBT did the same in the latter. DDT/TBT decreased AST opposing the effect of the contaminants alone in the 5-day experiment. Hepatic lesions index could be explained by a more acute effect of the contaminants alone or combined and by activation of cell defenses after the sub-chronic exposure. TBT increased melanomacrophages counting in the 5-day experiment and the mixtures increased it in the 5 and 15-day experiments. Overall, the majority of the biomarkers pointed to a more toxic effect when these contaminants were combined, leading to unexpected toxicities compared to individual exposure scenarios.

Atrazine is known to be an endocrine disruptor and its effects on gonads have been extensively reported, but the toxic action on other organs is poorly documented. In this paper, we investigated the toxicity of atrazine on the gills and spleens of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The median lethal concentration (LC50), capable of killing one-half of the test animals was calculated, and sublethal concentrations of atrazine were used in a semistatic and subchronic assay. The following four experimental groups were formed: control not exposed to atrazine, a group exposed to 1 ppm atrazine for 15 days, a group exposed to 2 ppm for 7 days, and a group exposed to 2 ppm for 15 days. The concentrations were verified during the study by high performance liquid chromatography. The gills and spleens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and histopathological findings were made. The Perls technique was used on the spleens to identify hemosiderin, lipofuscin, and melanin pigments in the cells from melanomacrophage centres (MMCs). The spleens were submitted to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immunohistochemistry, and morphometry was used to assess splenocyte proliferation and melanomacrophage iNOS expression. Finally, a colorimetric assay for caspase-3 was performed on the spleens to identify apoptosis. Vascular and structural alterations, such as venous sinus congestion, aneurysm, hemorrhage, pillar cell hypertrophy, disarrangement of secondary lamellae, and epithelial lifting were observed in the gills. The frequency of individuals with aneurysms was higher in the groups treated with 2 ppm than in other groups. Atrazine had an immunomodulatory effect on the spleen, observed by the alteration in the percentage of red and white pulp, alteration of the MMC area, changes in the melanomacrophage pigment content, slight iNOS suppression, decrease in splenocyte proliferation under 1 ppm atrazine, and increased caspase 3 activity under 2 ppm atrazine after 7 and 15 d. Such effects could compromise oxygenation and the immune response and, ultimately, the survival and fitness of the fish.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  24     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  50,10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.06.018     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Herbicide;Nile tilapia;Aneurysm;Immunotoxicity;Aquatic environment;Melanomacrophage;FRESH-WATER FISH;HISTOPATHOLOGICAL CHANGES;HERBICIDE ATRAZINE;TELEOST FISH;COMMON CARP;EXPOSURE;APOPTOSIS;IMMUNOTOXICITY;PROLIFERATION;CHLORPYRIFOS;Spleen,NA,NA,atrazine promotes immunomodulation by melanomacrophage centre alterations in spleen and vascular disorders in gills from <i>oreochromis niloticus<i>

Insecticide concentrations ranged from the held recommended dose rate (6.25 g ai/ha in 200 1 water) to 1/16th of field rate. Parasitoids responded strongly to patches of honeydew on filter papers, however the addition of increasing concentrations of deltamethrin caused increasingly early departure from the honeydew-treated areas. Parasitoids pre-exposed to field concentration residues for between and 20 min showed shorter retention times and abnormal types of behaviour on honeydew-treated patches compared to control wasps. Recovery of 'normal' behaviour patterns occurred over a 12, h period away from the insecticide source. Further laboratory studies examined the foraging of A. rhopalosiphi and one of its associated hyperparasitoids, Dendrocerus carpenteri (Curtis), on mature wheat plants treated with an artificial honeydew solution and deltamethrin. Wasps exposed to deltamethrin residues were observed to spend shorter visit times, to groom more frequently and to rest less frequently than those on insecticide-free plants. Differences were found between the distribution of parasitoids on insecticide-treated and untreated plants, with D. carpenteri showing greater movement down insecticide-treated plants accompanied with an increase in time spent on abaxial leaf surfaces compared to A. rhopalosiphi. The results are discussed in terms of the repellency of deltamethrin and the implications for integrated pest management of differing sub-lethal insecticide effects on primary parasitoid and hyperparasitoid behaviour.

Overall, our data show an increase in lipid peroxidation, and this was associated with an augmented expression of genes from the glutathione family of responses. Interestingly, PPAR expression in liver after exposure to TBOEP and TCEP was consistently decreased compared to controls, while expression in brain did not show a similar trend.

This paper examines pigeon pea pollination and considers how landscape context and agricultural intensification in terms of pesticide use affects the abundance of bees characterized by species guilds on crops. The study was conducted on six paired farms across a gradient of habitat complexity based on the distance of each farm from adjacent semi-natural vegetation in Kibwezi Sub-county, Kenya. The study found that farms which do not use insecticides in farm management, but are in close proximity to natural habitat have greater bee guild abundance, but at further distances, overall abundance is reduced with or without insecticide use. At 1 km landscape radius, the complexity of habitats but not patch size had a positive impact on the abundance of cavity nesting bees and mason bees, which can be attributed to the interspersion of the small-holder farms with semi-natural habitats across the landscapes producing mosaics of heterogeneous habitats. The study revealed the strongest relationships between fruit set and bee abundance to be with the carpenter bee, social bee and solitary bee guilds, which are among the most abundant bees visiting pigeon pea flowers in this system. Our findings provide the foundation for conservation efforts by identifying which bee guilds pollinated pigeon peas. From this study, we suggest managing the floral and nesting resources that would best support the most abundant crop pollinators, and also reducing insecticide application to the crop.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  70,10.1007/s10841-015-9788-z     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Functional group;Landscape effects;Pesticide;Semi-native;Species guild;Tropical agroecosystems;LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS;POLLINATION SERVICES;AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION;HABITAT FRAGMENTATION;ECOSYSTEM SERVICE;SPECIES RICHNESS;FARMING PRACTICE;HONEY-BEES;FRUIT-SET;WILD BEES;Kenya,NA,NA,local and landscape effects on bee functional guilds in pigeon pea crops in kenya

Societal issues include lack of community inclusion, pollution, and access to healthy foods. The high unemployment coupled with the rising cost of crude oil derivatives, and the growing general gap between cost of living and minimum wage levels contribute to a crippled consumer-driven US economy. Health concerns include increasing levels of obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. These epidemics lead to staggering economic burdens costing Americans hundreds of billions of dollars each year.        It is well-known that many of the health issues impacting Americans can be directly linked to the production, availability, and quality of the food. Factors contributing to the availability of food include reduction of United States farmland, an increase in food imported from overseas, and the cost of goods to the consumer. The quality of food is influenced by the method of growth as well as imposed preservation techniques to support food transportation and distribution. At the same time, it has become increasingly common to implement biotechnology in genetically modified crops for direct human food or indirectly as a livestock feed for animals consumed by humans Crops are also routinely dosed with pesticides and hounones in an attempt to increase productivity and revenue, with little consideration or understanding of the long term health effects.        Research shows that community gardens positively impact local employment, community involvement and inclusivity, and the diets of not only those involved in food production, but all members of their households. The purpose of this work is to determine the feasibility of an energy efficient large-scale aquaponic food production and distribution facility which could directly mitigate growing socioeconomic concerns in the US through applied best practices in sustainability. Aquaponics is a symbiotic relationship between aquaculture and hydroponics, where fish and plants grow harmoniously. The energy efficient facility would be located in an urban area, and employ solar panels, natural lighting, rain water reclamation, and a floor plan optimized for maximum food yield and energy efficiency. Examples of potential crops include multiple species of berries, corn, leafy vegetables, tomatoes, peppers, squash, and carrots. Potential livestock include responsibly farmed tilapia, shrimp, crayfish, and oysters.        The large scale aquaponic facility shows a lengthy period for financial return on investment whether traditional style construction of the building or a green construction style is used. However many forms of federal government aid and outside assistance exist for green construction to help drive down the risk in the higher initial investment which in the long run could end up being more profitable than going with a traditionally constructed building. Outside of financial return there are many proven, positive impacts that a large-scale aquaponic facility would have. Among these are greater social involvement and inclusivity, job creation, increased availability of fresh food, and strengthening of America's agriculture infrastructure leading to increased American independence.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  33,,IMPACT;GREEN,NA,NA,feasibility of an energy efficient largescale aquaponic food production and distribution facility

Previous reports support efficiency of some medicinal plants commonly used in Cameroonian folk medicine for the treatment of this disorder.        Objective: The present study was aimed at assessing the protective effect of extracts from selected plant species, namely Basella alba L. (Basellaceae) (MEBa) and Carpolobia alba G. Don (Polygalaceae) (AECa), in alleviating the maneb-induced impairment of male reproductive function in Wistar albino rats.        Materials and methods: The rats were treated with vehicle, plant extract (MEBa or AECa), maneb and maneb plus plant extract, respectively, and their fertility was assessed. Animals were thereafter sacrificed and organs (liver, kidneys and reproductive organs) were dissected out and weighed. Serum androgens together with alanine aminotransferase, liver glutathione and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) were also measured.        Results and discussion: From this study, both plant extracts stimulated testosterone and improved fertility. Administration of MEBa plus maneb prevented fertility reduction by maneb and minimized the inhibitory effect of maneb on testosterone levels. AECa also improved fertility of the maneb-exposed rats, though without restoring testosterone levels, and other investigated parameters remained unaffected by different treatments.

A small group of innovative ranchers in the Central Valleys are converting to holistic management through careful land-use planning, rotational grazing, diversified forage, and diminished use of purchased inputs. We compared the sustainability of 18 conventional and seven holistic, dual-purpose ranches, using three sets of sustainability metrics. First, we combined semistructured interviews and field observations to better describe the two productions systems and to calculate an ""Organic Conversion Index"" (OCI), combining economic, social, technological and environmental indicators. Holistic ranchers have more pasture divisions, higher grazing pressure, greater lengths of time between pasture burns, greater milk productivity, larger forest reserves, lower cow and calf mortality, purchase less hay and feed, and use less herbicides and pesticides than their conventional neighbors (T-tests and Fisher's Exact Tests; all p < 0.05). OCI was greater (T-test, p < 0.0005) for holistic ranches (81.8 +/- 4.6% compliance with organic standards), than for conventional ranches (32.1 +/- 9.0% compliance), with holistic ranches demonstrating superiority for nine of ten OCI indicators. Second, drawing on data from the same interviews, we conducted ""emergy"" analysis to quantify the embodied energy of inputs, outputs and sustainability of the ranching systems. The Emergy Yield Ratio, an index of a systems emergy throughput relative to the emergy in purchased inputs, was marginally higher in holistic ranches (T-test; p = 0.07), but became significant when only ranches >= 40 ha were analyzed (p = 0.04) and when government assistance (mostly in the form of machinery) was removed from the calculations (p = 0.008). Holistic ranches exhibited marginally higher Emergy Sustainability Indices, a measure of system yield relative to environmental impact, for all ranches combined (p = 0.07) and for ranches >= 40 ha (p = 0.06). Third, we sampled vegetation and soils on seven holistic and seven conventional ranches. We found higher soil respiration, deeper topsoil, increased earthworm presence, more tightly closed herbaceous canopies (all p < 0.05), and marginally greater forage availability (p = 0.053) in holistic ranches. Other variables, including soil compaction, soil chemistry and pasture tree cover, did not differ significantly between groups. These data are a snapshot of long, complex processes. Nonetheless, these complementary metrics combine to suggest that holistic management strategies are leading to greater ecological and economic sustainability. This production model merits further study for potential broader application as well as greater attention from decision makers concerned with ranching and the environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The samples were collected from the Gorjak creek (Zagreb, Croatia), a recipient of wastewater effluents from the pharmaceutical hidustry. Sediment samples were extracted and fractionated using a two-tiered approach. Resulting nonpolar, medium polar, and polar fractions were tested on the inhibition of P-gp activity using P-gp overexpressing PLHC-1/dox cells and calcein-AM as model substrate. The obtained ECM) values (up to 757 mu g/g, expressed in toxicity equivalents of model P-gp inhibitor cyclosporine A) revealed high inhibitory potential of polar 1 fractions of investigated sediments and clearly reflected the impact of pharmaceutical wastewater. P-gp specific ATPase assay and the cytotoxicity modulation experiments with colchicine indicated that most of the observed P-gp inhibition was due to the presence of noncompetitive inhibitors. A detailed chemical analysis by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS) revealed nonionic surfactants, including alcohol polyethoxylates (LAEOs) and polypropylene glycols (PPGs), as the major components of the most active subfractions.

Since the independence, it is observed that the Government of Bangladesh was very aware about the environmental conservation issue. After few years passed, the Government passed 'the Environment Pollution Control Ordinance, 1977. Later on, the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act 1995 due to its inadequacy repealed this law. In nineties, some severe environment pollutions relating to air, water, soil and food, deforestation, soil degradation, biodiversity, loss of ecosystems, draught etc; were found to over population, over harvest and degradation of resources, unplanned industrial development and management, indiscriminate use of pesticides, herbicides and chemical fertilizer, improper management of solid waste in urban areas, unwise use of ground water etc. Therefore, the Government formulated and passed the Environment Policy, 1992; Environment Action Plan, 1992 etc.; covering all sectors such as the forestry, fisheries, agriculture, urbanization, population, science and technology, legal aspects etc. In order to proper implement and execute of the environmental issues, the Government passed the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act 1995; the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Rules 1997 and the Environment Courts Act 2000 etc. The judiciary in Bangladesh is also healthy to the environment by applying and encouraging the public interest litigation and gradually developing in this regard. Some environmental non-governmental organizations also have been working in this field along with the help of civil society. In addition, the Government passed some important international environmental initiatives such as the Rio declaration 1992, the Stockholm Conference 1972; the UNFCCC 1992, Kyoto Protocol 1987, Johannesburg Conference 2002 to tackle the external and internal environmental problems of the country. However, the study finds that there are some constraints and problems such as the non-coordination, shortage of expertise, lack of commitments, corruption etc., in this regard.

First published February 29, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00243.2011.-The specific contribution of each antioxidant enzyme to protection against the reoxygenation-associated oxidative stress after periods of hypoxia is not well understood. We assessed the physiological role of catalase during posthypoxic reoxygenation by the combination of two approaches. First, catalase activity of Nile tilapias (Oreochromis niloticus) was 90% suppressed by intraperitoneal injection of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ, 1g/kg). In ATZ-injected fish, liver GSH levels, oxidative stress markers, and activities of other antioxidant enzymes remained unchanged. Second, animals with depleted catalase activity (or those saline-injected) were subjected to a cycle of severe hypoxia (dissolved O-2 = 0.28 mg/l for 3 h) followed by reoxygenation (0.5 to 24 h). Hypoxia did not induce changes in the above-mentioned parameters, either in saline-or in ATZ-injected animals. Reoxygenation increased superoxide dismutase activity in saline-injected fish, whose levels were similar to ATZ-injected animals. The activities of glutathione S-transferase, selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase, and total-GPX and the levels of GSH-eq, GSSG, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances remained unchanged during reoxygenation in both saline-and ATZ-injected fish. The GSSG/GSH-eq ratio in ATZ-injected fish increased at 30 min of reoxygenation compared with saline-injected ones. Reoxygenation also increased carbonyl protein levels in saline-injected fish, whose levels were similar to the ATZ-injected group. Our work shows that inhibition of liver tilapia catalase causes a redox imbalance during reoxygenation, which is insufficient to induce further oxidative stress. This indicates the relevance of hepatic catalase for hypoxia/reoxygenation stress in tilapia fish.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  46     Total Times Cited:  55     Cited Reference Count:  63,10.1152/ajpregu.00243.2011     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),aminotriazole;glutathione peroxidase;anoxia;reactive oxygen species;antioxidant;OXYGEN SPECIES FORMATION;FREE-RADICAL METABOLISM;ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSES;OXIDATIVE STRESS;SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE;IN-VIVO;SKELETAL-MUSCLE;GENE-EXPRESSION;HUMAN ERYTHROCYTES;ADAPTIVE RESPONSE;Catalase;Anoxia,NA,NA,role of catalase on the hypoxiareoxygenation stress in the hypoxiatolerant nile tilapia

For >30 years, numerous water-quality and biological- condition data have been accumulated by often disparate monitoring programs. This diagnostic analysis explored whether these legacy data could be used to correlate the presence of chemical stressors with biological condition impacts with the understanding that association is not necessarily causation. Other natural or anthropogenic stressors that may also impact biological conditions were not considered in this study. Acute-toxicity indices were calculated separately for trace metals and organic chemicals detected in surface waters between 1994 and 2010 and then compared with land-use metrics and vertebrate-and invertebrate-assemblage indices from surveys conducted basin-wide during this same period. Half of the possible relations between land use, biological condition, and toxicity were statistically significant at p <= 0.10. These results suggest that conditions for aquatic receptors improve either as agricultural or urban land decreases or as forested land increases and that chemical mixtures (primarily involving pesticides) may have impacted components of the basin's aquatic ecosystems. There may be a need for strengthened chemical-management practices on agricultural and urban lands and for maintaining undisturbed forested land to limit chemical migration into adjacent waters. Although these results indicate some utility for legacy data, they also suggest that a more defensible assessment of chemical stressors requires a program specifically designed for that purpose.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  57,10.1007/s00244-011-9713-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ASSEMBLAGE TOLERANCE INDEX;MODEL PERFORMANCE;RISK-ASSESSMENT;PESTICIDES;STREAMS;INTEGRITY;VALUES;FISH;MACROINVERTEBRATE;MIXTURES;Oregon,NA,NA,using legacy data to relate biological condition to cumulative aquatic toxicity in the willamette river basin oregon usa

Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        Numerous data gaps have been identified for the physical and chemical properties of the active substance and the formulation. The technical specification for this compound is open because the 5batch analysis was not conducted according to GLP. Data gaps for methods for the technical material, formulation, soil, water and air have been identified.        A critical area of concern was identified for methyl nonyl ketone in the mammalian toxicology section, as it was not possible to assess the compliance of the batches tested with the proposed specification (both missing). Based on the outcome of the vapour pressure study (data gap identified by physical chemical properties section), an acute inhalation toxicity study might be required.        No significant residues in plant or animal matrices were expected based on the representative use, and a quantitative consumer risk assessment is therefore not required.        The information on the environmental fate and behaviour of methyl nonyl ketone in relation to the representative uses assessed was insufficient to complete the necessary environmental exposure assessment at the EU level. The fate and behaviour in soil and natural sediment water systems has not been addressed. Consequently the environmental exposure assessment for soil, surface water and groundwater for any transformation products that might be formed from methyl nonyl ketone could not be finalised. A data gap was also identified for the adsorption/desorption properties of the active substance, and therefore the available predicted environmental concentrations in surface water can not be considered valid.

Blood meal was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 September 2009 pursuant to Article 24bof the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'), and has subsequently been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009(5), in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011(6), as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/2011(7). In accordance with Article 25a of the Regulation, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 114/20108, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2012 its view on the draft review report submitted by the European Commission in accordance with Article 25(1) of the Regulation. This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report.        Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on blood meal in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 3 November 2006. The peer review was initiated on 12 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR to the notifier Gyllebo Godning AB and on 16 December 2010 to the Member States for consultation. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that there was no need to conduct an expert consultation and EFSA should deliver its conclusions on blood meal.        The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of blood meal as a repellent on deciduous and coniferous trees in forestry, orchard trees and ornamental plants, as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        In the section for identity, physical, chemical and technical properties and methods of analysis data gaps were identified for a specification with supporting data, solubility in water, shelf-life, evidence that the formulation can form a useable solution and a method of analysis for the formulation.        No data gaps or critical areas of concern were identified in the mammalian toxicology section.        No data gaps or critical areas of concern were identified in the residue section.        The fate and behaviour in the environment of blood meal residues is expected to follow the normal pathways of dissipation and degradation common to naturally occurring residues of biological origin. Considering the nature of the substance and most methods of application leading to negligible levels of environmental exposure, further consideration of its fate and behaviour in the environment was concluded to be unnecessary, with the exception of when application is made by less targeted spray application methods such as air-assisted broadcast spraying. In this situation the environmental exposure assessment to aquatic systems was not finalised.        A data gap was identified in the ecotoxicology section for the mandatory toxicity studies with aquatic organisms (acute toxicity test for fish, acute toxicity test for aquatic invertebrates and chronic study for algae) to fulfil the Annex II data requirements. In addition, due to a missing aquatic exposure assessment when less targeted spray application methods are employed, the risk assessment for aquatic organisms was not finalised.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  2,10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2394     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Blood meal;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;repellent;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance blood meal

In accordance with Article 21(1) of the Regulation, France, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), provided an initial evaluation of 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid in the format of a Draft Assessment Report (DAR), which was received by the EFSA on 30 October 2007. The European Commission examined 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid in accordance with Article 24a of the Regulation and it was concluded that there were clear indications of harmful effects, leading to the adoption of a decision on non-inclusion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC, in accordance with Articles 24f and 25 of the Regulation.        Following the Commission Decision of 26 January 2009 (2009/65/EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant L. Gobbi s.r.l. made a resubmission application for the inclusion of 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/2678/08 - rev. 0).        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Italy, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 21 May 2010.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 28 May 2010. The DAR was also distributed for comments. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 13 July 2010.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the European Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology and ecotoxicology, and deliver its conclusions on 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid.        The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid as a plant growth regulator on tomatoes, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        Data gaps were identified in the section on physical and chemical properties and analytical methods.        No data gaps or critical area of concern were identified in the mammalian toxicology section.        In the residues section a substantial number of data gaps were identified. The residue definitions for risk assessment and for monitoring could not be agreed. Consequently, a consumer risk assessment could not be conducted.        The data available on fate and behaviour in the environment are essentially sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative uses. However, the identification of the major aquatic metabolites was not available. Once this data gap is fulfilled the exposure and risk assessments for these metabolites might need to be updated. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses by 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by the relevant FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        Various data gaps were included in the ecotoxicology section. A data gap was identified to address the risk to bees from 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid, as well as the long-term risk to earthworms. A data gap also remains to address the risk to non-target soil macro-organisms for the representative field uses. Furthermore, the applicant should submit data to address the acute toxicity of 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid to warm-water fish. Finally, a data gap was identified to address the effects of 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid on biological methods of sewage treatment.

In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by Italy, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of propargite in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC.        Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of propargite in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant (Chemtura Europe Ltd.) made a resubmission application for the inclusion of propargite in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR.        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Italy, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 4 March 2010.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 8 March 2010. The DAR was also distributed to Member States and the applicant for comments in view of the fact that the original peer review had been terminated following the applicant's notification of withdrawal of support. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 22 April 2010.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology, residues, fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on propargite.        The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of propargite as an acaricide on grapes and tomatoes, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        Two data gaps were identified in the section on identity.        The technical specification is not supported by the batches used in the toxicological studies leading to a critical area of concern; the toxicological relevance of the impurities has not been adequately addressed and a data gap was identified. In addition, due to the fact that propargite exerts carcinogenic potential on different organs in two strains of rats and a genotoxic mode of action cannot be disregarded, no reliable reference values could be set at this stage until a new valid genotoxicity datapackage with the proposed specification is available. Therefore, the risk assessment could not be conducted leading to a critical area of concern.        Five data gaps and one critical areas of concern were identified in the residues section. The consumer risk assessment could not be conducted.        The information on the environmental fate and behaviour of propargite in relation to the representative use assessed was insufficient to complete the necessary environmental exposure assessment at the EU level. The fate and behaviour of the cyclohexyl ring moiety of propargite in soil and natural sediment water systems has not been addressed. Consequently the environmental exposure assessment for soil, surface water and groundwater for any transformation products that might be formed from this proportion of the molecule (e.g. 1,2-cyclohexanediol and derivatives) could not be finalised. For the metabolite TBPC-sulfate and the unidentified metabolite ascribed as ""unk 1"", the groundwater exposure assessment could not be finalised in respect of comparison to the parametric groundwater drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L. Information was not available on the possible preferential degradation and or conversion of the isomers of propargite or its transformation products in the environment.        Eight data gaps and four critical areas of concern were identified in the ecotoxicology section. A high risk of propargite to aquatic organisms was identified (even with use of the risk mitigation measures comparable with 30 m non-spray buffer zones). A high long-term risk to mammals and a high risk to mammals from the consumption of contaminated water were identified. The risk from secondary poisoning to birds was identified as high, except for earthworm-eating bird in the grapes. The risk from secondary poisoning to mammals except for fish-eating mammals in the tomato scenario was assessed as high based on the available data.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  11,10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2087     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Propargite;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;acaricide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance propargite

In order to offer a sound evaluation of its ecotoxicological relevance it is critical to characterize substrate specificity of fish P-gp. Measurement of the ATPase activity is a reliable approach often used to discern type of interaction of various drugs with mammalian P-gp. A similar assay has never been used for characterization of P-gp in aquatic organisms and the main goal of this study was to develop a specific ATPase assay for characterization of fish P-gp. For this purpose we have used P-gp enriched membrane vesicles isolated from fish hepatoma PLHC-1/dox cells characterized by high overexpression of P-gp. As additional demonstration of a P-gp specific phenotype, we have quantified transcript expression of a series of eight ABC efflux transporter genes constitutively expressed in PLHC-1 wild type and PLHC-1/dox cells. Transcript expression analysis confirmed high and specific P-gp transcript overexpression in PLHC-1/dox cells. Provided that the transcript abundance is translated to protein, the development of ATPase assay is enabled. Using this model we determined Km(ATP) of 0.4 mM, baseline ATPase activity from 35-50 nmol/mg(PROT)/min, and maximal activation of ATPase activity obtained for fish P-gp in our system was 1.8-2.5-fold over baseline. All these values were in good agreement with data previously reported for mammalian P-gp. In order to perform a more detailed characterization of fish P-gp substrate specificity, in the next step of our study we used the developed ATPase assay to test 50 different compounds for their interaction with fish P-gp. The same set of compounds was also tested with calcein-AM (Ca-AM) transport activity assay both using PLHC-1/dox cells and NIH 3T3/MDR1 fibroblast cells overexpressing human P-gp. Our results showed that there is a clear difference for some substances five compounds specifically interacted only with fish P-gp, while seven compounds exhibited interaction with human P-gp only. Most of the compounds tested in this study showed similar behavior in respect to fish or human P-gp and relatively high correlation in the interaction potency was found between fish and human P-gp. In summary, the described results represent the first in depth insight into substrate specificity of an important xenobiotic efflux transporter in fish. In addition, our study showed that combination of Ca-AM assay and the developed ATPase assay using inside/out vesicles isolated from PLHC-1/dox cells, offers a high-throughput and reliable approach for identification of environmentally relevant pollutants that interact with fish P-gp.

This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on flurprimidol in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 20 April 2007. The peer review was initiated on 17 September 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant SePRO Europe Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March-April 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 31 July 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 151).        Following the Commission Decision of 13 January 2009 (2009/28/EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of flurprimidol in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant SePRO Europe Limited made a resubmission application for the inclusion of flurprimidol in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues and concerns identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/173/08)as follows:        The risk to operators and workers        The exceedence of the AOEL (acceptable operator exposure level) for operators and workers in all evaluated scenarios and conditions of use;        The lack of information on impurities present in the batches used in the toxicological studies.        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Finland, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 10 March 2010.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation ( EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 11 March 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 26 April 2010.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focussed peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on flurprimidol.        The conclusion of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a plant growth regulator in ornamentals as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in Appendix A.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Topflor', a micro-emulsion ( ME) containing 3.8 g/l flurprimidol.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. There are no adequate methods available to monitor flurprimidol in the environmental matrices and in body fluids and tissues.        In mammalian metabolism studies, flurprimidol was rapidly but not completely absorbed after oral administration. It was extensively metabolised and distributed through the body. Excretion was rapid, mainly via urine although some excretion was observed via bile and faeces. Moderate acute oral toxicity was found in rat and mouse, requiring classification with Xn, R22 ""harmful if swallowed"", but no classification was needed related to acute dermal or inhalation toxicity. Flurprimidol was not a skin or eye irritant and no sensitisation potential was found. Main effects observed in short-term and long-term toxicity studies were liver toxicity including enzyme induction and histopathological findings, and uterine and ovary weight changes down to the lowest dose tested, indicative of endocrine disruption effects at low doses. Genotoxicity studies covering all required endpoints (in vitro bacterial and mammalian gene mutation, chromosomal aberration and in vivo micronucleus test) were negative and no carcinogenic potential was observed in either rats or mice upon 2-year oral exposure.        Flurprimidol was thought to inhibit aromatase activity because the observed effects were similar to those observed with structurally related active substance fenarimol. However, no mechanistic study was performed with flurprimidol and sensitive end points for aromatase inhibition were not measured in studies conducted with flurprimidol. Reproductive toxicity was indicated by increased precoital period, dystocia, progeny mortality, reduced mating performance and fertility which were not considered secondary to parental systemic toxicity. Accordingly, classification as toxic, reproduction toxicity category 2 for fertility, R60 ""may impair fertility"", was proposed. In the rat developmental toxicity study, the proportion of foetuses with developmental variations and abnormalities was increased and could not be explained by maternal toxicity alone. Accordingly classification as harmful, reproduction toxicity category 3 for development, R63 ""possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was 0.003 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure ( AOEL) was 0.003 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was 0.09 mg/kg bw. Dermal absorption was 6 % for the concentrate formulation and 15 % for the in-use spray dilution based on an in vitro study performed on human skin. The estimated level of operator exposure calculated for glasshouses' uses on ornamentals with the representative formulation 'Topflor' according to the EUROPOEM II and the Dutch model is below the AOEL when the use of personal protective equipment (PPE, i.e. gloves and protective clothing) is considered. Estimated exposure of workers is below the AOEL after one application of 'Topflor' when the use of gloves and coverall is considered. After 2 applications (assuming that there is no decay in the residues during the 14-days interval between applications), estimated worker exposure exceeds the AOEL (103 %) even when PPE are worn and a critical area of concern was identified. Furthermore, flurprimidol is a racemate and there is no information on the relative toxicity of each isomer or whether there is a shift in the isomer ratio workers are exposed to. A data gap is identified to address this. Bystander's exposure is not relevant for the representative use.        No data were submitted to study and assess the residue behaviour of flurprimidol in plants and livestock in order to define the relevant residues for dietary consumer risk assessment. The representative use of flurprimidol in containerised ornamentals, pot and bedding plants are normally not expected to result in any dietary exposure to consumers or livestock. Potted herbs or any other edible container plants are not meant to be included in the representative use. A potential transfer of residues from recycled soil and/or compost to crops intended for human or animal consumption should be avoided, by taking appropriate restriction measures. Under conditions excluding any potential consumer exposure to flurprimidol residues through food, there will be no dietary consumer risk related to the representative use.        All available fate and behaviour into the environment studies have been performed with flurprimidol labelled exclusively at the phenyl ring and / or at the carbinol bridge. The meeting of experts identified a data gap for a full fate and behaviour data package of studies performed with flurprimidol labelled at the pyrimidine ring.        The data available for fate and behaviour of flurprimidol into the environment are very limited. Information on the fate of the individual enantiomers is not available. Data on the route of degradation in soil are insufficient to assess any use for which exposure could not be completely excluded. The data available show that flurprimidol exhibits medium to high persistence in soil (DT50 = 98 - 183 d) under laboratory aerobic conditions ( no field study available) and that it is not hydrolysed in buffered water in the range of environmental pHs. Photolysis of flurprimidol in water was relatively rapid ( DT50 = 1.4 d) and results in the formation of two photolysis metabolites that would need to be further assessed for the aquatic environment in the situation that exposure could not be completely excluded from the representative use. No water sediment study is available in the dossier. Potential groundwater contamination was precluded from the representative use if it is restricted as proposed by the meeting of experts. In general a number of data gaps for fate and behaviour into the environment were identified during the peer review, however, they were considered not to be essential for the assessment of the representative use if this can be effectively restricted / managed in order to avoid exposure to the environment, including the potential exposure arising from disposal of used soil and residues of plants. Note the PPR panel of EFSA, has questioned the effectiveness of risk management measures such as those proposed here, to limit environmental exposure from uses in glasshouses.        The environmental risk assessment covers only the use in glasshouses that are permanent structures. No risk assessment was conducted for birds and mammals. Direct exposure of birds and mammals is expected to be negligible for the representative use in glasshouses. The log P-ow of flurprimidol is >3 and therefore a risk assessment should be conducted for secondary poisoning of earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals if treated substrate and plants are disposed of in the environment. The risk to fish, aquatic invertebrates and algae was assessed as low. A study with higher aquatic plants is needed since flurprimidol is a plant growth regulator. However, the study is not required to finalise the EU risk assessment for the representative use if the use is restricted to high technology glasshouse production systems with irrigation/excess water management systems. Effects of >50% on mortality and reproduction were observed in sensitive groups of non-target arthropods at concentrations below the suggested application rate of 60 g a.s./ha. Arthropods used in glasshouses for biological plant protection purpose are likely to be severely impacted by the use of flurprimidol. The risk to non-target arthropods in the environment surrounding the glasshouse was considered to be low due to negligible exposure. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. No study was submitted to investigate long-term (reproductive) effects on earthworms. Such a study was considered not necessary provided that treated soil and plants are not disposed of in the environment. No risk assessment was conducted for other soil non-target organisms and non-target micro-organisms. However, the risk to soil dwelling organisms is assumed to be low for the use in high technology glasshouse production systems with irrigation/excess water management systems and provided that treated substrate and plants are not disposed of in the environment. The risk to non-target plants in the vicinity of glasshouses was considered to be low. The risk to bees and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  10,10.2903/j.efsa.2011.1962     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),flurprimidol;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;plant growth regulator;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance flurprimidol european food safety authority

The methodology was developed originally in the social sciences by Smith, Glass, Rosenthal, Hunter, and Schmidt, based on earlier pioneering contributions in statistics by Fisher, Pearson. Yates, and Cochran, but this approach to research synthesis has now been embraced within many scientific disciplines. However, only a handful of articles have been published in plant pathology and related fields utilizing meta-analysis. After reviewing basic concepts and approaches, methods for estimating parameters and interpreting results are shown. The advantages of meta-analysis are presented in terms of prediction and risk analysis, and the high statistical power that can be achieved for detecting significant effects of treatments or significant relationships between variables. Based on power considerations, the fallacy of naive counting of P values in a narrative review is demonstrated. Although there are many advantages to meta-analysis, results can be biased if the analysis is based on a nonrepresentative sample of study outcomes.

rayyan-1227191885,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fenbutatin oxide European Food Safety Authority,2010,9,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,8,9,,European Food Safety Authority,,English,,"EFSA, Parma, Italy","Fenbutatin oxide is one of the 84 substances of the third stage part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1490/2002(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007(4) In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by Belgium, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of fenbutatin oxide in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC.        Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 2008/934/EC)(5) concerning the noninclusion of fenbutatin oxide in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant BASF Agro B.V. made a resubmission application for the inclusion of fenbutatin oxide in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR.        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Belgium, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 1 December 2009.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 2 December 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 19 January 2010.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology, residues and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on fenbutatin oxide.        The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of fenbutatin oxide as an acaricide on apples, orange and tomato, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        For physical chemical properties no critical areas of concern were identified. Data gaps were identified for the relevant impurity and methods of analysis for all matrices except products of animal origin.        A clear conclusion on whether the toxicological batches cover the proposed specification cannot be drawn as sufficient data are not available. Consequently a data gap and a critical area of concern have been identified. One impurity (SD 31723) was considered relevant. A maximum upper limit of 3 g/kg for this impurity is covered by the toxicological dossier. Nevertheless, further data (i.e. genotoxic potential) are needed in order to support the higher proposed specification value of 20 g/kg. Further data are also needed to draw a clear conclusion on the toxicological properties of this compound as residue and data gap is identified.        In the residues area the consumer risk assessment for the representative uses cannot be finalised. A compound SD 31723 that is deemed to be of higher toxicity than fenbutatin oxide is insufficiently addressed in terms of toxicity data and data on the residue level in the fruit crops. Moreover, further residue data are necessary for fenbutatin oxide in tomatoes and oranges in order to remove uncertainty in the acute consumer risk assessment.        The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level, for the representative uses assessed. The potential for groundwater contamination by fenbutatin oxide was assessed as low from these representative uses.        A data gap was identified to provide information on the ecotoxicological relevance of the impurity SD 31723. A data gap was identified to address the long-term risk to mammals and to insectivorous birds, also taking into account all relevant species/feeding guilds, for the representative field uses evaluated. A high risk to earthworm-eating mammals and to fish-eating birds and mammals was not excluded and a data gap was identified. A high risk was identified to aquatic organisms at FOCUS step 4 providing mitigation measures comparable to no-spray buffer zone of up to 30m. A data gap was identified to further address the risk to aquatic invertebrates, taking into account the GAP and the most sensitive group. Further, a data gap was identified to refine the risk to fish, taking into account the behaviour of the substance in aquatic systems. A potential high first tier risk was indicated for nontarget arthropods and earthworms, but was further addressed by the submitted higher tier studies. The risk was low for the other non-target organisms.

The annual killifish has been suggested as a means of eradicating the aquatic stages of mosquitoes in transient pools because they can maintain permanent populations in such habitats by undergoing suspended animation or diapause during the embryonic stages to survive periodic drought. However, very little is known about the predatory activity of annual killifish and their usefulness in mosquito control.        Results: The annual killifish, Nothobranchius guentheri, native to Tanzania, was used in this investigation. Food preference was tested under laboratory conditions by feeding juvenile killifish with 2(nd) instar mosquito larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus in the presence of alternative food sources, such as rotifers and chironomid larvae. Semi-field tests were conducted by introduction of hibernating killifish embryos and juvenile fish to artificial ponds in an outdoor open environment that allowed natural oviposition of Cx. quinquefasciatus. Food preference studies show that N. guentheri preferred to prey on mosquito larvae than either chironomid or rotifers. When hibernating killifish embryos were added to ponds simultaneously with the addition of freshwater, the embryos hatched and fed on mosquito larval population resulting in complete elimination of the immature stages. The introduction of juvenile fish to ponds with high density of mosquito larvae resulted in total eradication of the mosquito population due to predation by fish. Complete biocontrol of the mosquito larval population was achieved in the presence of 3 fish per m(2) of pond surface area.        Conclusions: The annual killifish provides yet another tool that may be employed in the eradication diseases carried by mosquitoes through vector control, particularly in temporary bodies of freshwater. The fish can be conveniently transported in the absence of water in the form of hibernating embryos. Once introduced either as embryos or juveniles in ponds, the annual killifish can effectively reduce the larval population because of its aggressive predatory activity.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  31,10.1186/1756-3305-3-46     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ANNUAL FISH;DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY;EMBRYONIC DIAPAUSE;INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE;ANOPHELES-GAMBIAE;LARVIVOROUS FISH;DURATION;TEMPERATURE;Culicidae,NA,NA,the use of annual killifish in the biocontrol of the aquatic stages of mosquitoes in temporary bodies of fresh water a potential new tool in vector control

rayyan-1227191889,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance chlormequat (considered variant chlormequat chloride),2009,2,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,2,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Chlormequat is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on chlormequat in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 27 April 2007. The peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant task force, comprising BASF AG, CIBA Speciality Chemicals, NUFARM GmbH & Co KG and Taminco SA. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as plant growth regulator in cereals for stem stabilisation as proposed by the applicants. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached endpoints.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Chlormequat-chloride 750 g/L', a soluble concentrate (SL) containing 750 g/l chlormequat chloride.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Adequate analytical methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant origin, soil and air.        There are no adequate methods available to monitor chlormequat in animal products and in water.        With regard to the evaluation of the toxicological properties, the studies were performed with chlormequat chloride. The active substance was extensively absorbed, barely metabolised and rapidly excreted mainly by urine. The acute toxicity results with rats (after oral administration) and rabbits (after dermal administration) triggered the classification Xn, R21/22 ""Harmful in contact with skin and if swallowed"". In repeated dose studies, the dog appeared to be the most sensitive species, showing neuropharmacological effects, with an overall NOAEL of 4 mg/kg bw/day in the 1-year study. In mutagenicity and long-term tests, chlormequat chloride was not shown to have any genotoxic or carcinogenic properties. During the reproductive toxicity testing, fertility was affected at a maternal toxic dose level, leading to an overall parental NOAEL of 75 mg/kg bw/day and a reproductive NOAEL of 74 mg/kg bw/day. However, based on reduced body weight gain and focal muscular dystrophy, the offspring NOAEL was 41 mg/kg bw/day. No variations, retardations or malformations were observed in the developmental studies with rats and rabbits, and the maternal NOAEL was 75 mg/kg bw/day in rats and 20 mg/kg bw/day in rabbits. In mechanistic studies in vitro for neurotoxicity, chlormequat chloride showed a weak agonistic activity on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors.        With regard to the toxicological reference values, the agreed values reported as chlormequat chloride were 0.04 mg/kg bw/day for the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), 0.04 mg/kg bw/day for the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) and 0.09 mg/kg bw for the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD). The dermal absorption values were 4% for the concentrate and the dilution, based on an in vivo test. The operator exposure estimates were below the AOEL according to the German model with the use of personal protective equipment, but above the AOEL according to the UK POEM even with the use of personal protective equipment. The different exposure estimates for the worker and the bystander led to values below the AOEL.        With regard to residues, the metabolism of chlormequat chloride was investigated in wheat. The major component in grain and straw at harvest was unmetabolised chlormequat. Rotational crops data show that significant residues in succeeding and rotational crops are not expected to occur except in rotated cereals. However residues should not be higher than in cereals directly treated with chlormequat chloride according to the notified GAP. Currently, according to the conclusion of the expert meeting, only the use of chlormequat chloride on rye and triticale in Northern Europe would be supported by a sufficient number of residue trials to allow at least a provisional proposal of maximum residue levels (MRL) whereas uses have also been notified for wheat, barley and oats and also for use in Southern Europe. It is noted that the rapporteur Member State does not agree with this conclusion. Data gaps for further residue trials for all notified uses have been identified. On the basis of processing studies, processing factors have been calculated. After evaluation of animal metabolism studies and animal transfer studies with ruminants and poultry, MRLs for animal products have been provisionally proposed pending the submission of residue trials on primary crops and the demonstration of the validity of the analytical method used in feeding studies.        If the use of chlormequat chloride on only rye and triticale is considered in a provisional calculation, then the consumer exposure is expected to be below the toxicological reference values. However it is noted that the risk assessment does not cover the intake of barley, oats and wheat and therefore it is only indicative and the final assessment is pending submission of additional data.        With regard to the environmental fate and behaviour data, no significant metabolites were identified in laboratory aerobic route and rate of degradation studies using [chloroethyl-U-C-14] labelled chlormequat chloride. However a minor unidentified non-transient metabolite was found above 5% at two consecutive occasions. The formation of unextractable residues accounted for 19-28% of the applied radioactivity (AR) after 112 days, while significant mineralisation was observed (28.3-61.1% after 112 days). Chlormequat chloride exhibited moderate persistency in soil, first-order DT50 values were in the range from 27 to 34 days. The peer review concluded that no reliable data were available regarding the mobility of chlormequat chloride.        In dark natural water sediment systems chlormequat chloride degraded exhibiting low persistence without forming major metabolites. Peak partitioning of chlormequat chloride to the sediment was measured 30 days after dosing at a maximum of 63.3% AR. Mineralisation was significant and by the termination of the study (CO2)-C-14 represented 55.6-67.0% AR.        Based on the calculated photochemical oxidative degradation, air is not a likely route of environmental contamination by chlormequat chloride.        No reliable FOCUS calculations regarding the predicted environmental concentrations in surface water and sediment as well as for the leaching potential were available.        A potential high risk was indicated in the first-tier risk assessment for birds and mammals except for the long-term risk to insectivorous mammals. The refined risk assessment based on measured residues in plants resulted in TERs above the trigger for herbivorous birds. However the long-term risk assessment to insectivorous birds needs further refinement. The acute risk to insectivorous mammals and small herbivorous mammals and the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals were not sufficiently addressed and need further refinement. The log Pow of chlormequat chloride was less than 3 and therefore no risk assessment is triggered for secondary poisoning of fish-and earthworm-eating birds and mammals. No major metabolites were found in plants and hence no risk assessment for the uptake of plant metabolites was conducted. Daphnia magna was the most sensitive aquatic species tested. The FOCUS step 1 calculations resulted in TERs above the trigger of 100 and 10 for fish, algae and higher aquatic plants but not for daphnids. The TERs for daphnids exceeded the Annex VI trigger values by a factor of 3.5 (acute) and 2.6 (chronic) with FOCUS step 2 PECSW values. However there is some uncertainty with regard to the reliability of the PECSW water values since the adsorption/desorption study was conducted at too low temperatures. If the new PECSW values would be increased by more than 2.6 times then further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment would be needed (e.g. FOCUS step 3 or step 4 calculations). A final conclusion on the risk to aquatic organisms can be drawn once reliable PECSW values are available.        The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, non-target macro-and micro-organisms, nontarget plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for all representative uses.

rayyan-1227191890,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fenpyroximate,2008,10,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,10,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Fenpyroximate is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fenpyroximate in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 25 October 2005. The peer review was initiated on 5 May 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Nihon Nohyaku Co. Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and remaining issues were agreed on during a written procedure in April May 2007. The identified issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October and December 2007.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was initially finalised on 14 April 2008 (scientific report no. 143 refers) however, following an update to the Residues chapter, the conclusion is revised and re-issued in October 2008.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an acaricide on grapes, apples, pears and beans. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Kiron"", a suspension concentrate formulation (SC).        Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. The method of analysis for products of animal origin is only validated for fenpyroximate but the residue definition includes metabolite M-3(2) and therefore a data gap has been identified. Also the residue definition for surface water has not been finalised. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The technical specification could not be concluded on.        Regarding the mammalian metabolism, fenpyroximate showed a rapid but incomplete oral absorption and excretion, mainly via faeces; intensive enterohepatic circulation was observed. Fenpyroximate is harmful if swallowed and very toxic by inhalation; eye irritation and skin sensitisation were observed. Based on toxicokinetic properties and different toxicological profile of the substance via oral or inhalation, the meeting of experts concluded that the oral absorption was not representative of the bioavailability of fenpyroximate.        Critical effects observed through short term and long term studies were decreased body weight and food consumption. The relevant oral short term NOAEL is 1.3 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day, rat study and the relevant inhalation NOAEL is 0.54 mg/kg bw/day from the 4-week study in rats; relevant long-term NOAEL was the dose level of 0.97 mg/kg bw/day. No genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or neurotoxicity was observed; neither reproductive nor developmental parameters were affected by treatment with fenpyroximate.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is set at 0.01 mg/kg bw/day; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.005 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.02 mg/kg bw considering an assessment factor of 100 for all reference values.        Dermal absorption is 7% when handling the concentrate formulation and 24% when handling the spray dilution. Considering the representative uses of Kiron (pome fruits, grapes and beans), the estimated operator exposure exceeds the AOEL according to the UK POEM model; according to the German model calculations, exposure exceeds the AOEL for high crop, tractor mounted air blast sprayers (pome fruits and grapes); exposure resulting from high crop, hand held applications (grapes) and field crop, tractor mounted hydraulic sprayers (beans) is below the AOEL when the use of PPE as protective gloves during mixing/loading and gloves, protective garment and sturdy footwear during application is considered. Re-entry worker exposure is estimated to be below the AOEL only if additional protective clothing, as gloves, long sleeved shirt and long trousers is considered. Bystander's exposure exceeds the AOEL for high crop applications, either tractor mounted or hand held; however for field crop applications (beans), bystander's exposure is estimated to be below the AOEL.        The plant metabolism of fenpyroximate is very slow. Only one metabolite, the (Z)-isomer of the active substance (M-1) (3) is included in the residue definition for risk assessment. Further information is required to ensure that the toxicological reference values allocated to fenpyroximate cover its (Z) isomer. Some insufficiencies were identified in the submitted residue trials and further data are required. These deficiencies do not allow proposing an MRL in pome fruits. Studies are also required to investigate the stability of residues under hydrolysis conditions simulating processing. Transfer of soil residues to succeeding crops cannot be excluded for the use evaluated on beans harvested fresh.        Based on animal metabolism and feeding studies, one animal metabolite is expected to reach quantifiable residue levels in ruminant liver and kidney.        A provisional consumer exposure assessment has shown potential for children exposure in the range of the ARfD for apples, pears and grapes. This may however be reconsidered on the basis of more appropriate residue data for pome fruits. For grapes an option for decision makers is to consider to set the MRL at 0.2mg/kg instead of 0.3mg/kg.        In soil under aerobic conditions fenpyroximate exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the major soil metabolite M-3 (accounting for up to 10.8% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits moderate to medium persistence and the minor non transient metabolite M-11(4) (accounting for up to 8.8%AR). Mineralisation of both the pyrazole and benzyl rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 17% AR and 51-65% AR respectively after 112 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 23.5-58.3 % AR and 21-41%AR respectively after 100-112 days. Fenpyroximate is immobile in soil, M-3 exhibits medium to low mobility in soil whilst M-11 is estimated by quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) calculations to exhibit medium mobility. There was no indication that adsorption of any of these compound was pH dependent.        In dark natural sediment water systems fenpyroximate degraded exhibiting moderate persistence but partitioned relatively rapidly from water to sediment where the major metabolite M-11 was formed.        M-3 and M-8(5) were major metabolites in water. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was an insignificant sink for the pyrazole ring radiolabel in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 1.9 % AR at 105 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a more significant sink representing up to 28 % AR at study end. As no experiment is available where the benzyl ring was investigated a data gap is identified for further information on the fate and behaviour of the benzyl moiety in natural sediment water systems. In laboratory aqueous photolysis studies the Z isomer of fenpyroximate (M1) was a major metabolite. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for fenpyroximate at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolites M-3, M-11 and M-8 appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by fenpyroximate and its soil metabolites M-3 and M-11 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        The acute and short term risk to birds can be considered as low for all representative uses evaluated. The blue tit is accepted as a focal species to refine the risk to insectivorous birds in pome fruit and vines. The tier 1 long-term risk assessment to birds did not identify low risk for any of the uses. Both PD and PT were refined in the risk assessment for orchard use and the PD was refined in the vine scenario. However, the TER did not reach the Annex VI trigger and a data gap is identified to refine the risk assessment for insectivorous birds in both orchards and vines. The yellowhammer and the grey partridge are accepted as focal species to refine the assessment of the risk to insectivorous and herbivorous birds respectively in beans. An acceptable risk was identified with refinements of PD in both scenarios.        Based on the first tier risk assessment the acute risk to herbivorous mammals can be considered as low for all representative uses evaluated.. A refined long term risk assessment was needed for all representative uses. In a refined risk assessment the hare is used as focal species in beans and the bank vole is used for the representative uses in pome fruit and grapevine. The risk to mammals in beans can be considered low based on the hare, unattractiveness of crop, and an interception factor of 0.7. The risk to bank vole is considered low for uses in orchards and vine yard, based on a refined PD. The risk from secondary earthworm and fish poisoning is considered low for both birds and mammals Furthermore the risk to birds and mammals from ingestion of contaminated drinking water is considered low.        Fenpyroximate is very toxic to aquatic organisms both on an acute as on a chronic time scale. A similar toxicity to fish, algae and aquatic invertebrates was observed. The higher tier toxicity test with fish in the present of sediment was accepted as the relevant endpoint in the aquatic risk assessment.        Based on the available data the risk to aquatic organisms is considered low in all FOCUSsw Step 4 scenarios for all uses if sufficient non spray buffer zones are included. Buffer zones of 70 m, 45 m and 20 m are required for pome fruit, vine and bean respectively. The conclusion of the aquatic risk assessment may however change, as a data gap was identified for a fish full life cycle study. The risk from M-3 and M-8 to aquatic organisms is considered low. A BCF of 1601 was experimentally derived for whole fish. The risk to bees is considered low. A data gap is identified for a study to address the in-field risk to A. rhopalosiphi. The in-field risk to T pyri is considered to be low, as the off-field risk is considered to be low for all non-target arthropods if buffer zones up to 5 meter are applied. The risk to earthworms is considered to be low both for the parent and the metabolites M-3 and M-11. Also the risk to non-target marcro-organisms, non-target micro-organisms and non-target plants is considered low.

rayyan-1227191891,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Flurprimidol,2008,10,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,10,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Flurprimidol is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on flurprimidol in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 20 April 2007. The peer review was initiated on 17 September 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant SePRO Europe Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March April 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a plant growth regulator in ornamentals as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Topflor"", a micro-emulsion (ME) containing 3.8 g/1 flurprimidol.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. There are no adequate methods available to monitor flurprimidol in the environmental matrices and in body fluids and tissues. There is no agreed specification.        A critical area of concern was raised by the experts in mammalian toxicology on the lack of information on impurities present in the batches used in the toxicological studies. In mammalian metabolism studies, flurprimidol was rapidly but not completely absorbed after oral administration; it was extensively metabolised and distributed through the body; excretion was rapid, mainly via urine although some excretion was observed via bile and faeces. Moderate acute oral toxicity was found in rat and mouse, requiring classification with Xn, R22 ""harmful if swallowed"", but no classification was needed related to acute dermal or inhalation toxicity. Flurprimidol was not a skin or eye irritant and no sensitisation potential was found. Main effects observed in short term and long term toxicity studies were liver toxicity including enzyme induction and histopathological findings, and uterine and ovary weight changes down to the lowest dose tested, indicative of endocrine disruption effects at low doses. Genotoxicity studies covering all required endpoints (in vitro bacterial and mammalian gene mutation, chromosomal aberration and in vivo micronucleus test) were negative and no carcinogenic potential was observed in either rats or mice upon 2-year oral exposure.        Flurprimidol was thought to inhibit aromatase activity because the observed effects were similar to those observed with structurally related active substance fenarimol. However, no mechanistic study was performed with flurprimidol and sensitive endpoints for aromatase inhibition were not measured in studies conducted with flurprimidol. Reproductive toxicity was indicated by increased precoital period, dystocia, progeny mortality, reduced mating performance and fertility which were not considered secondary to parental systemic toxicity; accordingly, classification as toxic, reproduction toxicity category 2 for fertility, R60 ""may impair fertility"", was proposed. In the rat developmental toxicity study, the proportion of foetuses with developmental variations and abnormalities was increased and could not be explained by maternal toxicity alone; accordingly classification as harmful, reproduction toxicity category 3 for development, R63 ""possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was 0.003 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure (AOEL) was 0.003 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was 0.09 mg/kg bw. Dermal absorption was 10 % for the concentrate formulation (default value, taking into account that measurements were available in an in vivo monkey study with the active substance) and 100 % for the in-use spray dilution (default value for no data). The level of operator exposure calculated for glasshouses' uses on ornamentals with the representative formulation Topflor exceeded the AOEL, even when the use of protective clothing was considered, according to the EUROPOEM II and the Dutch model. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with flurprimidol exceeded also the AOEL, even after only one application and when the use of gloves was considered. Bystander's exposure was not relevant for this type of use.        No data was submitted to study and assess the residue behaviour of flurprimidol in plants and livestock animals in order to define the relevant residues for dietary consumer risk assessment. The representative uses of flurprimidol in containerized ornamentals, pot and bedding plants are normally not expected to result in any dietary exposure to consumers or livestock animals Potted herbs or any other edible container plants are not meant to be included in these notified uses. A potential transfer of residues from recycled soil and/or compost to crops intended for human or animal consumption should be avoided, possibly by appropriate restriction measures. Under conditions excluding any potential consumer exposure to flurprimidol residues through food, there will be no dietary consumer risk related to the notified representative uses.        All fate and behaviour into the environment studies available have been performed with flurprimidol labelled exclusively at the phenyl ring and / or at the carbinol bridge. The meeting of experts identified a data gap for a full fate and behaviour data package of studies performed with flurprimidol labelled at the pyrimidine ring. The data available for fate and behaviour of flurprimidol into the environment is very limited. Data on the route of degradation in soil is insufficient to assess any use for which exposure could not be completely excluded. The data available shows that flurprimidol is medium to high persistent in soil (DT50 = 98 183 d) under laboratory aerobic conditions (no field study available) and that it is not hydrolysed in buffered water in the range of environmental pHs. Photolysis of flurprimidol in water was relatively rapid (DT50 = 1.4 d) and results in the formation of two photolysis metabolites that would need to be further assessed for aquatic environment in case exposure could not be completely excluded from the use proposed. No water sediment study is available in the dossier. Potential ground water contamination was precluded from the representative use proposed if it is restricted as proposed by the meeting of experts. In general a number of data gaps for fate and behaviour into the environment were identified during the peer review; however, they were considered not to be essential for the assessment of the representative use if this is restricted / managed in order to avoid exposure to the environment, including the potential exposure arising from disposal of soil used and residues of plants.        The environmental risk assessment covers only the use in greenhouses that are permanent structures. No risk assessment was conducted for birds and mammals. Direct exposure of birds and mammals is expected to be negligible for the representative use in greenhouse. The log P-ow of flurprimidol is >3 and therefore a risk assessment should be conducted for secondary poisoning of earthworm and fish eating birds and mammals if treated substrate and plants are disposed of in the environment. The risk to fish, aquatic invertebrates and algae was assessed as low. A study with higher aquatic plants is needed since flurprimidol is a plant growth regulator. However the study is not required to finalise the EU risk assessment for the proposed use if the use is restricted to high technology greenhouse production systems with irrigation/excess water management systems. Effects of >50% on mortality and reproduction were observed in sensitive groups of non-target arthropods at concentrations below the suggested application rate of 60 g a.s./ha. Arthropods used in glasshouses for biological plant protection purpose are likely to be severely impacted by the use of flurprimidol. The risk to non-target arthropods in the environment surrounding the greenhouse was considered to be low due to negligible exposure. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. No study was submitted to investigate long-term (reproductive) effects on earthworms. Such a study was considered not necessary provided that treated soil and plants are not disposed of in the environment. No risk assessment was conducted for other soil non-target organisms and non-target micro-organisms. However the risk to soil dwelling organisms is assumed to be low for the use in high technology greenhouse production systems with irrigation/excess water management systems and provided that treated substrate and plants are not disposed of in the environment.        The risk to non-target plants in the vicinity of greenhouses was considered to be low. The risk to bees and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

Major objectives were to: 1) quantify and describe relationships among mercury, selenium, glutathione peroxidase, and stable isotopes of C and N in blood and epidermis; 2) elucidate major parameters that influence blood mercury and glutathione peroxidase activity; 3) relate measures of tissue mercury, selenium, and glutathione peroxidase to specific ecological, hematological, morphological, or life history parameters, including season, sex, age, and trophic level. Mercury in both tissues examined is almost exclusively methylmercury. Epidermal concentrations of mercury and selenium reflect their respective amounts in blood, albeit at several times blood concentrations of mercury. The strong association between blood mercury and serum selenium, in conjunction with a lack of significant correlation between blood mercury and glutathione peroxidase, implies that a substantial proportion of blood mercury is affiliated with another selenium-containing moiety or is related to recent dietary intakes (e.g., trophic level, intensive fish consumption). Circulating blood mercury may be described in terms of serum selenium concentration, along with interaction terms among serum selenium, blood delta N-15, and age. Current selenium concentrations in Sarasota Bay dolphins appear adequate for maintenance of blood glutathione peroxidase activity.

Although the whitefly is often controlled using chemical pesticides, biological control agents constitute an important component in integrated pest management programs, especially in protected agriculture. One of these agents is the wasp Eretmocerus mundus (Mercet) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae). E. mundus lays its egg on the leaf underneath the second-third instar nymph of B. tabaci. First instars of the wasp hatch and penetrate the whitefly nymphs. Initiation of parasitization induces the host to form a capsule composed of epidermal cells around the parasitoid. The physiological and molecular processes underlying B. tabaci-E. mundus interactions have never been investigated.        Results: We used a cDNA microarray containing 6,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the whitefly genome to study the parasitoid-whitefly interaction. We compared RNA samples collected at two time points of the parasitization process: when the parasitoid first instar starts the penetration process and once it has fully penetrated the host. The results clearly indicated that genes known to be part of the defense pathways described in other insects are also involved in the response of B. tabaci to parasitization by E. mundus. Some of these responses included repression of a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) and induction of a melanization cascade. A second set of genes that responded strongly to parasitization were bacterial, encoded by whitefly symbionts. Quantitative real-time PCR and FISH analyses showed that proliferation of Rickettsia, a facultative secondary symbiont, is strongly induced upon initiation of the parasitization process, a result that supported previous reports suggesting that endosymbionts might be involved in the insect host's resistance to various environmental stresses.        Conclusion: This is the first study to examine the transcriptional response of a hemipteran insect to attack by a biological control agent (hymenopterous parasitoid), using a new genomic approach developed for this insect pest. The defense response in B. tabaci involves genes related to the immune response as described in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster. Moreover, endosymbionts of B. tabaci appear to play a role in the response to parasitization, as supported by previously published results from aphids.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  72     Total Times Cited:  81     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.1186/1471-2164-9-342     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),GENOME-WIDE ANALYSIS;DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER;ACYRTHOSIPHON-PISUM;APOLIPOPHORIN-III;RESISTANCE;EXPRESSION;CDNA;APHIDS;IDENTIFICATION;TRANSMISSION;Bacteria,NA,NA,parasitization by the wasp <i>eretmocerus mundus<i> induces transcription of genes related to immune response and symbiotic bacteria proliferation in the whitefly <i>bemisia tabaci<i>

In eastern Slovakia, they were produced until 1985. During 2002-04, a birth cohort of mothers (n = 1057) residing in two Slovak districts was enrolled at delivery, and their specimens and information were collected after birth. Congeners of PCBs were measured in maternal serum by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection. In this study, we used multiple linear regression to examine the effects of prenatal PCB exposure on birthweight adjusted for gestational age, controlling for inter-pregnancy interval, and maternal smoking, age, education, ethnicity, pre-pregnancy body mass index and height.        The association between total maternal serum PCB levels and birthweight was not statistically significant. However, an interaction model indicated that maternal PCB concentrations were associated with lower birthweight in Romani boys. Based on the fitted regression model, the predicted birthweight of Romani boys at the 90th percentile of maternal PCBs (12.8 ng/mL) was 133 g lower than the predicted birthweight at the 10th percentile of maternal PCBs (1.6 ng/mL). This is a similar magnitude of effect to that observed for maternal smoking and birthweight. These results suggest that higher levels of PCBs in maternal blood sera may inhibit growth in boys, particularly in those already affected by social factors related to ethnicity. This study is consistent with previous findings that boys are more susceptible than girls to growth restriction induced by in utero organochlorine exposures, and further indicates that high PCBs may magnify the influence of social disadvantage in this vulnerable group of boys.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  64     Total Times Cited:  68     Cited Reference Count:  51,10.1111/j.1365-3016.2008.00929.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PCBs;birthweight;ethnic origin;interaction;susceptibility;PERSISTENT ORGANOCHLORINE COMPOUNDS;DIBENZO-P-DIOXINS;HYDROXYLATED METABOLITES;ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE;EPIDEMIOLOGIC EVIDENCE;INTRAUTERINE GROWTH;PREGNANCY ESTRIOL;FISH CONSUMPTION;GESTATIONAL-AGE;EARLY-CHILDHOOD;Slovakia,NA,NA,prenatal polychlorinated biphenyl exposures in eastern slovakia modify effects of social factors on birthweight

Freshwater bodies which chemistry is dominated by dissolved humic substances (HS) seem to be the major type on Earth, due to huge non-calcareous geological formations in the Northern Hemisphere and in the tropics. Based on the paradigm of the inertness of being organic, direct interactions of dissolved HS with freshwater organisms are mostly neglected. However, dissolved organic carbon, the majority of which being HS, are natural environmental chemicals and should therefore directly interact with organisms. Major results that widened our perspective on humic substance ecology come from experiments with the compost nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, which behaved contradictorily to textbook knowledge and provoked an in-depth re-consideration of some paradigms.        Approach. To overcome old paradigms on HS and their potential interactions with organisms, we reviewed recent international literature, as well as 'grey' literature. We also include results from own ongoing studies.        Results. This review focuses on direct interactions of dissolved HS with freshwater organisms and disregards indirect effects, such as under-water light quenching. Instead we show with some macrophyte and algal species that HS adversely interfere with photosynthesis and growth, whereby closely related algal species show different response patterns. In addition to this, HS suppress cyanobacteria more than eukaryotic algae. Quinones in the HS appear to be the effective structure.        Furthermore, HS can modulate the offspring numbers in the nematode C. elegans and cause feminization of fish and amphibians - they possess hormone-like properties. The ecological consequences of this potential remain obscure at present.        HS also have the potential to act as chemical attractants as shown with C. elegans and exert a mild chemical stress upon aquatic organisms in many ways: induction of molecular chaperons (stress proteins), induction and modulation of biotransformation and anti-oxidant enzymes. Furthermore, they produce an oxidative stress with lipidperoxidation as one clear symptom or even stress defense strategy. Stronger chemical stresses by HS may even lead to teratogenic effects as shown with fish embryos; all physiological responses to HS-mediated stress require energy, which were compensated on the expense of yolk as shown with zebra fish embryos. One Finnish field survey supports the view of a strong chemical stress, as the weight yield in fish species decreases with increasing HS content in the lakes.        Discussion. HS exert a variety of stress symptoms in aquatic and compost organisms. According to current paradigms of ecotoxicology, these symptoms have to be considered adverse, because their compensation consumes energy which is deducted from the main metabolism. However, the nematode C. elegans looks actively for such stressful environments, and this behavior is only understandable in the light of new paradigms of aging mechanisms, particularly the Green Theory of Aging. In this respect, we discuss the mild HS-mediated stress to aquatic and compost organisms. New empirical findings with HS themselves and HS building blocks appear to be consistent with this emerging paradigm and show that the individual lifespan may be expanded. At present the ecological consequences of these findings remain obscure.

We previously isolated a novel antibacterial protein termed SSAP (Sebastes schlegeli antibacterial protein) from the skin mucus of the rockfish S. schlegeli and identified it as a new member of the L-amino acid oxidase (LAO) family. In the present study, the localization of SSAP in S. schlegeli was investigated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, quantitative real time RT-PCR, Western blotting and measurements of LAO and antibacterial activities. SSAP mRNA was expressed dominantly in skin and gill and weakly in ovary or kidney as shown by RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR. The quantity of SSAP mRNA in skin varied among the individuals, ranging from 1.1 to 13.9 ng mu g(-1) total RNA, although no relationship was found between the size of fish and gene expression. SSAP was exclusively detected in skin and gill by Western blotting using a specific anti-SSAP antiserum. In addition, the extracts of both tissues apparently showed LAO activity and antibacterial activity against Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida. This study demonstrates that SSAP is predominantly synthesized in skin and gill and probably functions as an antibacterial LAO in both tissues. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This review focuses on direct and indirect interactions between dissolved humic substances (HS) and freshwater organisms and presents novel opinions and hypotheses on their ecological significance. Despite their abundance in freshwaters, the role of HS is still inadequately understood. These substances have been considered too large to be taken up by freshwater organisms. On the contrary, here we present evidence that dissolved HS are indeed taken up and interact directly and/or indirectly with freshwater organisms.        2. We show that dissolved HS exert a mild chemical stress upon aquatic organisms in many ways; they induce molecular chaperones (stress shock proteins), induce and modulate biotransformation enzymes and modulate (mainly inhibiting) the photosynthetic release of oxygen by freshwater plants. Furthermore, they produce an oxidative stress, which may lead to membrane oxidation. HS modulate the multixenobiotic resistance activity and probably other membrane-bound pumps. This property may lead to the increased bioaccumulation of xenobiotic chemicals. Furthermore, they can modulate the numbers of offspring in a nematode and feminise fish and amphibians. The ecological consequences of this potential remain obscure at present. HS also have the potential to act as chemical attractants (as shown with a nematode).        3. In some macrophytes and algae we show that HS interfere with photosynthesis and growth. For instance, the presence of HS suppresses cyanobacteria more than eukaryotic algae. By applying a quantitative structure activity relationship approach, we show that quinones in the HS interfere with photosynthetic electron transport. We show that even Phragmites leachate can act as a kind of phytotoxin. HS also have the potential to suppress fungal growth, as shown with the water mould Saprolegnia parasitica and force the fungus to respond by spore production.        4. In very soft, humic freshwaters, such as the Rio Negro, Brazil, HS stimulate the uptake of essential ions, such as Na and Ca, at extremely low pH (3.5-4.0) and prevent the ionoregulatory disturbance induced by acid waters, thereby enabling fish to survive in these environments.        5. We discuss whether or not HS are directly utilised by aquatic microorganisms or via exoenzymes, which may be washed in from the terrestrial catchment. There is accumulating evidence that the quality of the HS controls microbial growth. In total, net-heterotrophy may result from HS-mediated suppression of primary production by the quinone structures and/or from HS-mediated support of microbial growth. As there is also evidence that HS have the potential to support photoautotrophic growth and suppress microbial growth, the opposite community effect could result. Consequently, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has to be chemically characterised, rather than simply measuring bulk DOC concentration.        6. In sum, dissolved HS interact with freshwater organisms in a variety of ways in unenriched humic lakes. In addition to the well known effects of HS on light regime, for example, and the direct and indirect supply with carbon (energy), other interactions may be much more subtle. For instance, HS may induce internal biochemical stress defence systems and have the potential to cause acclimatisation and even adaptation. We are just at the beginning of understanding these interactions between dissolved HS and freshwater organisms.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  222     Total Times Cited:  247     Cited Reference Count:  136,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01571.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),chemical stress defence;dissolved humic substances;feminisation;membrane irritation;natural herbicides;NATURAL ORGANIC-MATTER;ACID INDUCES APOPTOSIS;LIFE-SPAN;ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION;COLOSSOMA-MACROPOMUM;PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION;PLANKTONIC BACTERIA;NITELLOPSIS-OBTUSA;ELECTRON-ACCEPTORS;DISEASE RESISTANCE,NA,NA,dissolved humic substances ecological driving forces from the individual to the ecosystem level

It describes the mechanism of action and toxic effects of Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate on non-target organisms — flatworms, amphibians, and mammals. Commercial formulations based on glyphosate are dangerous for living organisms, as they lead to behavioural disorders, reduce reproductive parameters, and may cause metabolic disorders. In fish, Roundup causes damage to the liver, brain, and gills, and triggers degenerative changes in the kidneys. Sub-lethal doses of this pesticide impair locomotor activity and damage DNA through oxidative stress. Many experiments show toxic effects of Roundup on fish reproduction. Reported anomalies include disturbances in embryogenesis (e.g. pericardial oedema or tail bend), reduced embryo survival, and an increase in the number of deformed larvae. Roundup and glyphosate inhibit ovarian follicular growth in adult females. Adult males exposed to the pesticide have inferior semen quality, with limited sperm concentration and motility. Roundup represents a serious threat to land and water organisms, and therefore its use must be limited. © 2022, Polish Society of Animal Production.

Where these industries operate in proximity, research is needed to better understand any interactions and their possible effects. This study explored the effects of azamethiphos on survival and development of larval American lobsters, Homarus americanus, using exposures that reflect concentrations and durations of azamethiphos (anti-sea lice therapeutant used in salmon aquaculture) that can be found in the environment following treatment. In adult trials, we recorded the survival and behaviour of individuals consecutively exposed to short pulses of low concentrations of azamethiphos for a period of 1 to 4 days. Larvae from all stages (I-IV) exhibited an immobilization response when exposed to azamethiphos and that the concentration of azamethiphos that results in a 50% increase in immobilization decreases at increasing exposure time and was as low as 2.9 μgL−1 for a 3 h exposure. After exposure, we registered mortality occurring within 5 days and during the moulting window. In the larval trials the concentration required to reduce the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity by 50% increased from stages I to III. In the trials conducted with adults, we observed no mortality over 21 days, but did record an increase in aggressive behaviour with an increasing number of exposures. The temporal overlap between the release of larval lobster stages and the use of azamethiphos is important to consider when assessing potential risk. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: B. de Jourdan; Benjamin de Jourdan, Huntsman Marine Science Centre, New Brunswick, Canada; email: benjamin.dejourdan@huntsmanmarine.ca; CODEN: AQREF",10.1111/are.16109,American lobster;azamethiphos;management;risk assessment;salmon farming;sublethal effects;immobilization;larva;lobster fishery;mortality;pesticide;salmonid;survival;Pesticides,NA,NA,evaluating nonlethal and latent effects of the antisea lice pesticide azamethiphos on larvae and adults of the american lobster homarus americanus

Few papers have reported the side effect of the pesticide on population dynamics of aquatic taxa such as shrimps, gastropods, macrophytes, phytoplankton, and bacteria. Here, we tested the effect of a single application of tebufenpyrad on Neocaridina palmata, Physa fontinalis, Ceratophyllum demersum, Simocephalus vetulus, Dolerocypris sinensis, and so on, by indoor systems. The TWA (Time-weighted average)-based highest no observed effect concentration (NOEC) and lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) for Neocaridina palmata, which were counted by the wet weight, were 0.67 and 2.33 μg/L, respectively, and the dose-related effect lasted 21 d. According to our study, chitobiase could be used to quantify the effects of the pesticide on shrimp despite the interference from P. fontinalis, which was finally corrected by employing of antibodies. The NOEC and LOEC were thus determined to be 1.41 and ≤ 5.64 μg/L, respectively, which were higher than the values that was counted by the wet weight. Principal component analysis (PCA) and principal response curve (PRC) investigation showed that the pesticide suppressed population of C. demersum, and phytoplankton, while the Physa fontinalis, S. vetulus, and D. sinensis were stimulated by the pesticide. Illumina MiSeq was used to determine the alteration in bacterial community within the systems. The results of PRC and PCA analyses showed that tebufenpyrad induced flora of nitrate reducing, nitrate denitrifying, thiosulfate oxidation, ureolysis, and methanol oxidation, while it suppressed flora of cellulolysis. Tebufenpyrad was found to have a negative effect on water quality indicators such as pH, DO, NO3−, NO2−, and SO42−, and a positive effect on PO43−, NH4+, and EC.

Currently, ALA mainly relies on chemical synthesis; however, this method is unsustainable and cannot meet the increasing demand because of its low yields. In this study, through phylogenetic analysis and the statistic of gene numbers downstream to hemA, we selected 4 candidate hemA genes with high potential for ALA production from genome sequences of 562 bacterial strains and found that hemA from Burkholderia caryophylli had the best effect on ALA production. Next, we found the match of HemA and homologous glutamyl-tRNAGlu, and further properly overexpressing gltX and tRNAGlu increased glutamyl-tRNAGlu recognition by HemA. Moreover, through the rational combination of gene elements from B. caryophylli (hemA, tRNAGlu) and Salmonella typhimurium (gltX, hemL), optimizing the gene expression model, as well as E. coli hosts, the efficiency of ALA synthesis through the C5 pathway was significantly enhanced in engineered E. coli BurAt-SalSL1 (T7). Finally, we developed a whole-cell bioconversion system to produce ALA for the first time and 20.89 g ALA was obtained from 42.42 g glutamate with a conversion of 63.51% after six catalytic recycles.

Furthermore, we characterized the growth of 24 bacterial and 3 yeast species on Chromatic MH agar with the aid of rapid spot tests for same-day identification. The coefficient of variation for reproducibility of dDD of four reference strains in 4 to 10 replicates (238 data points) ranged from 0% to 16.3%. Together with an additional 10 challenge isolates, the overall categorical agreement was 91.7% (351 data points). The following bacteria were readily identifiable: cream/white Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes; turquoise Streptococcus agalactiae, enterococci, Listeria monocytogenes; mauve Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei, Citrobacter freundii; dark-blue Klebsiella and Enterobacter; green Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and brown Proteus.

After exposure, the accumulations of TEB in gonads were observed and the cumulative egg production was evidently decreased. The decline of fertilization rate in F1 embryos was also observed. Then the changes in sperm motility and histomorphology of gonads were discovered, evaluating that TEB had adverse effects on gonadal development. Additionally, we also found the alternations of social behavior, 17β-estradiol (E2) level, and testosterone (T) level. Furthermore, the expression levels of genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and social behavior were remarkably altered. Taken together, it could be concluded that TEB affected the egg production and fertilization rate by interfering with gonadal development, sex hormone secretion, and social behavior, which were eventually attributed to the disruption of the expressions of genes associated with the HPG axis and social behavior.

However, the impacts of different drivers on stoichiometric (carbon, C; nitrogen, N; and phosphorus, P) variations of organisms have not been well addressed. In order to understand how stoichiometric traits vary across trophic levels under different environmental stressors, we performed a mesocosm experiment to explore the impacts of warming (including +3 °C consistent warming above ambient and heat waves ranging from 0 to 6 °C), eutrophication, herbicide and their interactions on stoichiometric traits of organisms at different trophic levels, which was quantified by stable nitrogen isotopes. Results showed that herbicide treatment had no significant impacts on all stochiometric traits, while warming and eutrophication significantly affected the stoichiometric traits of organisms at lower trophic levels. Eutrophication increased nutrient contents and decreased C: nutrient ratios in primary producers, while the response of N:P ratios depended on the taxonomic group. The contribution of temperature treatments to stoichiometric variation was less than that of eutrophication. Heat waves counteracted the impacts of eutrophication, which was different from the effects of continuous warming, indicating that eutrophication impacts on organism stoichiometric traits depended on climate scenarios. Compared to environmental drivers, taxonomic group was the dominant driver that determined the variations of stoichiometric traits. Furthermore, the stoichiometric stability of organisms was strongly positively correlated with their trophic levels. Our results demonstrate that warming and eutrophication might substantially alter the stoichiometric traits of lower trophic levels, thus impairing the nutrient transfer to higher trophic level, which might further change the structure of food webs and functions of the ecosystems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: P.

Its increased production and wide applications can lead to adverse effects on aquatic life because it enters the aquatic environment through agricultural and urban runoff, industrial effluents, drift, leaching, etc. So, it is vital to understand the main mechanisms of cypermethrin-mediated toxicity before they cause harmful effects on human health. This chapter summarizes the toxic effects of cypermethrin on the reproductive system of zebrafish, a model organism. Pesticides enter the fish through dermal, respiratory, and oral routes. The mechanisms of cypermethrin-mediated toxicity to aquatic organisms can be defined in three basic prospects: induction of oxidative stress, disturbances in ion channels, and induction of DNA damage that can cause increased free radical production in cell and ultimately damage to cell membranes and DNA.

These agents are replacements for brominated flame retardants but have not yet faced similar scrutiny for developmental neurotoxicity. We examined a representative organophosphate flame retardant, triphenyl phosphate (TPP) and its potential effects on behavioral development and dopaminergic function. Methods: Female Sprague–Dawley rats were given low doses of TPP (16 or 32 mg kg−1 day−1) via subcutaneous osmotic minipumps, begun preconception and continued into the early postnatal period. Offspring were administered a battery of behavioral tests from adolescence into adulthood, and littermates were used to evaluate dopaminergic synaptic function. Results: Offspring with TPP exposures showed increased latency to begin eating in the novelty-suppressed feeding test, impaired object recognition memory, impaired choice accuracy in the visual signal detection test, and sex-selective effects on locomotor activity in adolescence (males) but not adulthood. Male, but not female, offspring showed marked increases in dopamine utilization in the striatum, evidenced by an increase in the ratio of the primary dopamine metabolite (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) relative to dopamine levels.

Their results demonstrated that even in a small and relatively uniform freshwater system (a pond of 0.1 ha), the so-called total sampling approach failed to provide the true number of any species of fish in the pond. The outcome of the study provided the evidence to debunk the assumption that absolute numbers of fishes can be obtained using rotenone treatment. This article therefore allowed me to defend my doctoral dissertation in the face of critical comments from a principal jury member, and firm proponent of ‘absolute sampling’, and it provided fish biologists with justification to focus on the development and application of sampling approaches, such as relative densities, which do not require futile attempts to obtain total fish numbers. © 2022, Crown.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: G.H.

Fish (30.2 ± 2.1 g) were fed 0 (control), 5, 10 and 15 g/kg basal diet of Sargassum angustifolium extract (SAE) for 60 days and then exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of diazinon (2 mg/l) for 24 h. The biochemical assays were conducted in two times including at the end of feeding period and after 24 h exposure to diazinon. According to the results, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the liver remained unchanged (P>0.01) during feeding period, while significantly increased in response to diazinon in control and fish fed 5 and 10 g/kg diet SAE (P<0.01). The hepatic metabolic enzymes (AST: Aspartate aminotransferase, ALT: Alanine aminotransferase, LDH: lactate dehydrogenase, CK: creatine kinase) showed no significant changes in all groups during feeding period, while these enzymes increased in Non-SAE supplemented fish and those fed 5 and 10 g/kg SAE after exposure to diazinon (P<0.01). Although little elevations were observed in the activity of hepatic antioxidant enzymes (CAT: catalase, SOD: superoxide dismutase, GPx: Glutathione peroxidase) in fish fed SAE, these elevations were not significant (P>0.01). After exposure to diazinon, antioxidant enzymes significantly decreased in control and fish fed 5 g/kg diet SAE, while the fish of 10 and 15 g/kg diet SAE treatments showed significant elevations (P<0.01). The antioxidant-related genes (sod, cat, gpx) significantly expressed more in response to dietary SAE compared to control (P<0.01). After exposure to diazinon, all groups showed significant elevations in antioxidant-related genes (P<0.01). In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed the antioxidant enhancing effects of SAE at dietary levels of 10 and 15 g/kg diet, which this effect may be attributed to some antioxidant components in the chemical composition of the macro-Algae or to the direct effect of SAE on antioxidant defence system of the fish.  © 2022 Widodo Brontowiyono et al., published by Sciendo.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: S.A.

Therefore, this paper reports the investigation of the disinfectant potential of extracts and isolated compounds from Baccharis dracunculifolia. For this purpose, extracts of aerial parts (BD-C), tricomial wash (BD-L) and roots (BD-R) of B. dracunculifolia were obtained by maceration. The extracts were submitted to different chromatographic techniques, including high-speedy countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC) furnishing nine isolated compounds. The extracts and isolated compounds were evaluated regarding their antimicrobial activity by the broth microdilution method, according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, and regarding their sanitizing activity according to Standard Operating Procedure No. 65·3210·007 (INCQS, 2011), developed by the National Institute for Quality Control in Health (INCQS) – Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ). In the antimicrobial evaluation the BD-C extract showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 200 and 100 µg/ml against Staphylococcus aureus and Tricophyton mentagrophytes, respectively. BD-L extract showed MIC value of 200 µg/ml against S. aureus. The isolated compounds caffeic acid (MBC 2·22 µmol l−1), ferulic acid (MBC 2·06 µmol l−1) and baccharin (MBC 0·27 µmol l−1) showed significant inhibitory activity against S. aureus. All B. dracunculifolia isolated compounds were active with exception of aromadrendin-4´-O-methyl-ether for T. mentagrophytes. Additionally, isosakuranetin was active against Salmonella choleraesuis (MIC 1·4 µmol l−1). Regarding the sanitizing activity, the hydroalcoholic solution containing 0·2% of B. dracunculifolia extract in 40°GL ethanol was effective in eliminating the microbial contamination on all carrier cylinders and against all microorganisms evaluated in the recommended exposure time of 10 min. Therefore, B. dracunculifolia has potential for the development of sanitizing agents to be used in hospitals, food manufactures and homes. © 2022 The Society for Applied Microbiology.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: J.K.

The toxigenic mechanisms of P. globosa, however, remain largely unclear due to the multiple structures and/or synergistic or antagonistic effects of hemolytic compounds. External stressors could lead to the regulation of photoprotective or antioxidative defense system, as well as the potential hemolytic activity. Therefore, the light-induced photosynthetic system, including the accessory photosynthetic growth, the relative electron transfer rate (ETR), photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), quantum yield of photosystem II (Yield), together with the hemolytic activity of P. globosa were investigated under variable environmental conditions in the present study. Results confirmed that hemolytic activity of P. globosa was initiated by the light, but inhibited by low temperature (16 °C), high light intensity (>100 µmol/(m2·s)), and iron-limited conditions. Interestingly, the hemolytic activity was not impacted by photosynthetic electron inhibitors (Diuron, atrazine, paraquat, and dibromothymoquinone), which significantly inhibited the photosynthetic activity of P. globosa. The correlated response of hemolytic and photosynthetic activity of P. globosa under those environmental factors suggested that the hemolytic compounds of P. globosa would be involved in the photosynthetic process but not in the electron transfer chain of P. globosa. © 2022, Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: T.

In this study, zebrafish were exposed to 1.00 and 10.00 mg/L dinotefuran enantiomers for 96 h, after which multivariate pattern recognition, metabolite identification, and pathway analysis were performed. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were then conducted to reveal the metabolic perturbations caused by dinotefuran enantiomers. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed the perturbation of five main pathways, including phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis; phenylalanine metabolism; retinol metabolism; arginine and proline metabolism; and glycerophospholipid metabolism. These disturbed metabolic pathways were strongly correlated with energy, amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Pathway analysis also indicated that the metabolic pathway changes induced by the same level of R and S-dinotefuran were enantioselective.

The study surveyed 90 organic/converted rice producers as respondents. Data analysis was performed by Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), which was followed by Network Process Analysis (NPA). MDS was utilized to assess the sustainability of the five dimensions: environmental, economic, social, institutional, and technological. Meanwhile, NPA was conducted based on the MDS analysis findings to identify the essential methods for sustainability improvement. The research unveiled that the environmental, economic, social, and institutional dimensions were quite sustainable. However, the technological dimension was less sustainable. Multidimensionally, organic paddy farming was quite sustainable. Based on the identified priority strategy, increasing the availability of organic matter and organisms in the soil would improve the sustainability of organic paddy farming.

However, it has faced severe challenges due to significant cases of environmental pollution, pathogen outbreaks, and the lack of traceability that guarantees the quality assurance of its products. Such context has prompted many researchers to work on the development of novel, affordable, and reliable technologies, many based on nanophotonic sensing methodologies. These emerging technologies, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), localised SPR (LSPR), and fibre-optic SPR (FO-SPR) systems, overcome many of the drawbacks of conventional analytical tools in terms of portability, reagent and solvent use, and the simplicity of sample pre-treatments, which would benefit a more sustainable and profitable aquaculture. To highlight the current progress made in these technologies that would allow them to be transferred for implementation in the field, along with the lag with respect to the most cutting-edge plasmonic sensing, this review provides a variety of information on recent advances in these emerging methodologies that can be used to comprehensively monitor the various operations involving the different commercial stages of farmed aquaculture. For example, to detect environmental hazards, track fish health through biochemical indicators, and monitor disease and biosecurity of fish meat products.

It was found that the component range of EO in species of the genus Thymus depends on the microclimatic conditions of the population. The range of essential oils in the raw material of Th. Serpyllum and Th. Pulegoides is 7–9 mL and Th. Marschallianus is 3.5 mL. The research found that the plants Th. Serpyllum and Th. Pulegoides that grow in sunny habitats have an aromatic mono- and bicyclic monoterpenoid chemotype (K/α-T-neol/ G/p-C/B), with total dominance of carvacrol and p-cymene. The populations of Th. Serpyllum, which grow on the edges of sparse pine forests, and populations of Th. Pullegioide, with denser plant cover and which grow in meadows, have an acyclic and bicyclic monoterpene chemotype (G/α-T-neol/B/K). Plants that grow in the communities of meadow-steppe vegetation have the following chemotypes: Th. Serpyllum—L/K/G with 63% of linalool, Th. Pullegioides—G/α-T-neol/L/B, and Th. Marschallianus—α-T-neol/K/L/α-T-nen/G/B. Of these, the dominant chemotypes are α-terpineol and carvacrol (28:6.5%). A wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity was registered in samples of Th. Pullegoides and Th. Serpyllum that have an aromatic-monoterpenoid chemotype. Essential oils of Th. Pullegoides were dominated by carvacrol, and p-cymene had the highest fungicidal action (41.00 ± 1.0%). Plant populations of Th. Pullegoides and Th.

Therefore, this paper proposes a farming action recognition network (FARnet), which can accurately locate the farmers in the video and detect the actions of “applying pesticides” and “inspection.” The dataset was captured and produced by multi-angle cameras, which were consulted with relevant experts. In this network, Coordinate Attention (CA) was used to improve the Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks-tiny (ELAN-tiny) and Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) structures in the YOLOv7-tiny network. The precise implementation methods are as follows: (1) The convolution in ELAN-tiny was replaced with the CA module, and a shortcut was added. (2) A CA module was added to the final layer of the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module. (3) The improved Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks-Coordinate Attention (ELAN-CA) and Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Coordinate Attention (SPP-CA) were used to extract action features and perform feature correction by ADD (Feature fusion by feature map summation) in the backbone. The results demonstrated that the FARnet achieved significantly better detection results than the YOLOv7-tiny network, where mAP@.5 improved by 0.1% from 99.4% to 99.5%, and the mAP@.5:.95 improved by 6.6% from 78.2% to 84.8%. Therefore, the FARnet can effectively detect and identify the “inspection” and “applying pesticides” actions of farmers and provide useful input information for the intelligent management system. © 2023 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: C.

These OMVs were morphologically characterized and the most abundant vesicle-associated proteins were identified. We also demonstrate that Phdp OMVs protect Phdp cells from the bactericidal activity of fish antimicrobial peptides, suggesting that secretion of OMVs is part of the strategy used by Phdp to evade host defense mechanisms. Importantly, the vaccination of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) with adjuvant-free crude OMVs induced the production of anti-Phdp antibodies and resulted in partial protection against Phdp infection.

The die-off corresponded in time with the application, of pesticides for the control of mosquitoes that carried West Nile virus, a new emerging. disease in North America at the time. In order to determine the possible implication of pesticide application as a direct cause or contributing factor in the die-off, we studied the effects of experimental exposure to malathion on the health of lobsters. Lobsters were exposed in 20 gallon tanks, and the direct toxicity as well as sub-lethal effects on the immune system were determined. The 96 h LC50 for malathion upon single exposure was 38 mug/l. Malathion degraded rapidly in sea water, with 65-77% lost after I day and 83-96% lost after 3 days. Phagocytosis was significantly decreased 3 days after a single exposure to initial water concentrations as low as 5 ppb, when measured water concentrations were as low as 0.55 ppb. Similarly, effects on phagocytosis were observed at 1, 2 and 3 weeks after the initiation of weekly exposures. Cell counts did not differ significantly upon exposure to malathion. Malathion was not detected in muscle and hepatopancreas of exposed lobsters. Evaluation of phagocytosis is-a sensitive indicator of subtle sub-lethal effects of malathion, and relatively small concentrations of malathion (6-7 times lower than the LC50) can affect lobster defense mechanisms.

Reproductive, behavioral, and immunological effects in wildlife were publicly not only understood as possible threats to wildlife populations, but also as early warning signals that human health could be at risk. Above all, the public has been concerned about negative outcomes in reproductive health, and effects like feminization in fish were regarded as evidence for the biological plausibility of the hypothesis that environmental levels of hormonally active chemicals are high enough to affect human reproductive health.        Public concern has been mirrored by several parliamentary and governmental decisions emphasizing the need for extensive research and rapid measures to reduce the risk associated with endocrine-disrupting substances.        Endocrine disruption in wildlife is clearly a priority issue. At least in densely populated areas like Europe, symptoms of endocrine disruption in wildlife cannot only be detected in areas with abnormally high levels of pollution, but have also occurred in main river systems, estuaries, and even in the open sea. Imposex in mollusks and feminization in fish that were clearly related to disturbances in the hormonal system of these organisms by exogenous substances have been used as markers in monitoring programs. Though symptoms of endocrine disruption can be clearly identified, it is much more difficult to link these outcomes to causative chemicals or mixtures of substances. Natural and pharmaceutical hormones, phytoestrogens, pesticides, and industrial chemicals may all play a role to a different degree depending on the site under study. This means that several different risk-reduction strategies have to be applied, including bans of substances, use restrictions, and installation and optimization of sewage treatment works embedded in a strategy for the overall reduction of chemical input into the environment.        It should be noted that, in addition to national and international regulatory actions taken by state authorities, a considerable reduction of the environmental input could be achieved in several countries by voluntary actions taken by industry.        Regulatory bodies are still facing major problems in the field of risk assessment and risk reduction. Association between effects and causative agents or mixtures are in many cases weak. Important tools for risk assessment such as dose-response relationships or the existence of thresholds are not yet agreed on. These uncertainties are the reason that many national governments and the European Commission have identified precaution as the main element in chemicals policy for the management of endocrine disruptors.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  65,10.1351/pac200375112563     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),THAIS-CLAVIGERA;ROCK SHELL;IMPOSEX;TBT;CONTAMINATION;VITELLOGENIN;FISH;NEOGASTROPODS;BIOMARKERS;CHEMICALS,NA,NA,government view of endocrine disruption in wildlife

Here we conducted 4 experiments to examine interactions between shellfish and toxic (actively toxic or TOX-A from finfish-killing cultures and potentially toxic or TOX-B from cultures without finfish) and non-inducible (NON-IND, apparently incapable of killing fish via a toxic effect) strains of P. piscicida. First (Expt 1), we documented direct physical attack by P. piscicida TOX-A, TOX-B, and NON-IND zoospores on larvae of the bay scallop Argopecten irradians (Lamarck, 1819) and the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin, 1791). Within 5 min zoospores swarmed around larvae that had discarded their vela, and attached with their peduncles. Within 15 min they had penetrated into the shellfish visceral cavity and had begun to feed aggressively; after 30 min all shellfish tissues except the adductor muscle had been consumed. Second, we tested the response of scallop larvae to P. piscicida (TOX-A or TOX-B) or. cryptomonads (as controls) that were held in dialysis tubing (0.22 mum porosity) to prevent direct contact. After 60 min larval survival was 0% in the TOX-A treatment, 100% in the cryptomonad control, and intermediate in TOX-B and TOX-B+ cryptomonad treatments. The data indicate a toxic effect of P. piscicida zoospores on the larvae, separate from the physical effect shown in Expt 1. Third, we compared grazing by juvenile and adult oysters on TOX-A, TOX-B, and NON-IND P. piscicida zoospores from the medium. After 60 min, grazing by juvenile oysters significantly differed as NON-IND TOX-B TOX-A. In contrast, adult oysters grazed significantly fewer TOX-A zoospores and maintained comparable grazing on TOX-B and NON-IND zoospores. Thus juvenile oysters, but not adults, were sensitive to residual toxicity of TOX-B zoospores, and both life-history stages were sensitive to TOX-A zoospores. The adverse effects of toxic strains on larval survival and juvenile grazing indicate that P. piscicida could potentially affect shellfish recruitment. Fourth, we assessed zoospore survival after passage through the digestive tract of adult oysters. The feces contained many temporary cysts from zoospores, and within 24 h > 75 % of the cysts produced motile cells. The data indicate that adult oysters would be poor biocontrol agents of P. piscicida, given the high survival of ingested zoospores following gut passage and fecal elimination; and that oysters could act as vectors of toxic P. piscicida strains if transported from affected estuaries to other waters.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  39     Total Times Cited:  45     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.3354/meps245001     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Argopecten irradians;Crassostrea virginica;oyster;Pfiesteria;scallop;shellfish;temporary cyst;toxic dinoflagellate;RAT PITUITARY-CELLS;PROTOGONYAULAX-TAMARENSIS;CRASSOSTREA-VIRGINICA;BEHAVIOR;MANAGEMENT;SHUMWAYAE;RECEPTOR;IMPACTS;SCIENCE;COMPLEX,NA,NA,interactions between the toxic estuarine dinoflagellate <i>pfiesteria piscicida<i> and two species of bivalve molluscs

Two eco-types of killer whales, 'transient' and 'resident', occur in all of these regions. These eco-types are genetically distinct and differ in various aspects of morphology, vocalization patterns, diet and habitat use. Various genetic and photo-identification studies of eastern North Pacific killer whales have provided information on the male-female composition of most of these resident pods and transient groups, as well as the approximate ages, reproductive status and putative recruitment order (birth order) of the individual whales. Biopsy blubber samples of free-ranging resident and transient killer whales from the Kenai Fjords/Prince William Sound,, AK region were acquired during the 1994-1999 field seasons and analyzed for selected organochlorines (OCs), including dioxin-like CB congeners and DDTs. Concentrations of OCs in transient killer whales (marine mammal-eating) were much higher than those found in resident animals (fish-eating) apparently due to differences in diets of these two killer whale eco-types. Certain life-history parameters such as sex, age and reproductive status also influenced the concentrations of OCs in the Alaskan killer whales. Reproductive female whales contained much lower levels of OCs than sexually immature whales or mature male animals in the same age class likely due to transfer of OCs from the female to her offspring during gestation and lactation. Recruitment order also influenced the concentrations of OCs in the Alaskan killer whales. In adult mate residents, first-recruited whales contained much higher OC concentrations than those measured in non-first-recruited (e.g. second recruited. third recruited) resident animals in the same age group. This study provides baseline OC data for free ranging Alaskan killer whales for which there is little contaminant information. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

These two offices, the Office of Toxic Substances, now the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) and the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP), assess risks posed by industrial chemicals and pesticides, respectively. Each office had developed separate testing guidance and methods. Under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, OPPT developed and published an extensive set of environmental effects test guidelines and technical support documents on testing requirements. In a similar manner, OPP published data requirements for registration of pesticides and developed Standard Evaluation Procedures (SEPs) to explain the procedures used to evaluate submitted ecological effects data. Harmonization of OPPT and OPP guidelines is advantageous because it avoids unnecessary testing, conserves resources, and avoids duplicative testing of chemicals being reviewed by more than one office. Also, there is better coordination of test reviews between each office and greater consistency in test interpretation. Harmonization results in increased guideline uniformity between offices, and a more efficient means of revising and updating the OPPTS guidelines. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was similarly engaged in guideline development in the 1970s, and published a set of biotic effects test guidelines in 1981 (second addendum was published in 1984). EPA intends to harmonize OPPTS guidelines with those of the OECD to avoid unnecessary testing of chemicals in international commerce, increase efficiency in reviewing chemicals, use fewer test animals, and reduce nontariff trade barriers. Efforts to date by OPPTS have resulted in developing drafts of ecological effects test guidelines (the ""850"" harmonized guidelines). These were available as public drafts in 1996; the OPP Scientific Advisory Panel commented on them at that time. Currently the guidelines are being revised and will be available as part 850 in volume 40 of the US Code of Federal Regulations. Examples are discussed of how the harmonized test guideline process between OPPTS and OECD operates and the progress achieved to date. These include development of a revised OECD daphnid chronic test, a new harmonized fish early life stage test, a new OECD aquatic macrophyte toxicity test (Lemna [duckweed] growth inhibition test), and OECD activities in chironomid sediment testing and terrestrial plant toxicity testing. Important harmonization limitations, possible problems, challenges, and future activities are discussed.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  25,10.1520/STP15823S     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),"harmonization;ecological effects test methods;TSCA;US EPA;OPPTS;OECD;""850"" guidelines",NA,NA,harmonization of ecological effects test methods between the us epa oppts and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd description results and current activities

Aseptic conditions are normally not achieved. Most commercial disinfectants are mixed preparations. The agents used in disinfectants should not provoke changes, neither in chemical pattern, nor in sensoric properties of the food. They should not be the cause for deposition of unhealthy residues or for corrosive influences on premises. The efficacy must be warranted. The disinfection should include bactericidal, fungicidal and possibly virucidal activities with only minimal static effects. The efficacy should be based on a short-term effect even at lower temperatures (about 10 degrees C).

Aldehydes in mixtures are used very seldomly and only in small amounts due to sensoric, corrosive or toxicological reactions. Alcohols are suitable for quick applications but they are flammable. Organic acids and peroxygens will deliver no residues but may be aggressive to tools and man. Alkylamines will have higher static effects and chlorine active compounds will suffer from protein load and pH deviations. In daily practice the efficacy has to be proved by microbiological monitoring, e.g. by cultural or, indirectly, by bioluminescence-techniques (with or without somatic ATP).

The formation of biologically plausible hypotheses regarding disruption of reproduction in wildlife can be facilitated by mechanistic studies on laboratory animals. To this end, we are investigating the in vivo and in vitro effects of endocrine-disrupting toxicants in rodents. In vitro studies have used receptor binding and transfected cell assays to confirm the suspected mechanism of action, whereas in vivo rodent studies examine altered sexual differentiation. Antiandrogenic pesticides compete with the natural ligands for both rat and human androgen receptors, block androgen-induced gene expression in vitro and in vivo, delay puberty, reduce sex accessory,oland size, and alter male rat sex differentiation. In contrast, xenoestrogens affect female central nervous system sex differentiation and fecundity without producing malformations or infertility in-male offspring. Prenatal administration of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or the TCDD-like polychlorinated biphenyls produce yet another profile of effects in the offspring, reducing numbers of ejaculated sperm in male progeny and inducing urogenital malformations in females. Although phthalates are reported to be estrogenic in vitro, in vivo exposure causes developmental alterations that more closely resemble antiandrogenic activity. The mammalian data indicate that exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals produces effects that are pathognomonic for mechanisms by which they act. Mechanistic information derived from mammalian studies can enhance our ability to predict toxicant effects on reproduction in fish and wildlife.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  51     Total Times Cited:  53     Cited Reference Count:  84,10.1002/etc.5620170113     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),dioxins;phthalates;antiandrogens;estrogens;reproductive development;POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS PCB;ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR-BINDING;MALE-RATS;LACTATIONAL EXPOSURE;FEMALE RATS;IN-UTERO;PRENATAL EXPOSURE;NEONATAL EXPOSURE;ANDROGENIC STATUS;PREOPTIC AREA;Animal Shells;Animals,NA,NA,the value of mechanistic studies in laboratory animals for the prediction of reproductive effects in wildlife endocrine effects on mammalian sexual differentiation

NAPRA (National Pesticide Risk Assessment) was developed by the Soil Conservation Service (now the Natural Resource Conservation Service) to assess the relative risk of pesticides contaminating the ground or surface water. A joint project was funded to link the output of the NAPRA program with the MAIZE expert system. By linking the programs, MAIZE could provide extension agents and crop advisors with management alternatives that are efficacious, environmentally sound and low cost. A complete training package was designed to accompany the MAIZE/NAPRA program.        Standard crop management scenarios for the Pequea-Mill Creek watershed were defined and submitted to SCS, these scenarios were then run through the NAPRA process and an output database was generated. This information included soil characteristics, runoff, organic matter, cropping information, erosion information, and climate information for the appropriate chemicals, this numbered over 49,000 scenarios. MAIZE was modified to access this information and display it in a user friendly format. On the basis of site specific inputs, MAIZE identifies the most efficacious pesticides. MAIZE then searches the output file from NAPRA that contains the relative environmental risk information for the pesticides under the specific site characteristics. A table is created that lists each chemical, its cost, its relative risk of runoff (fish toxicity) and its relative risk to ground water (human toxicity). The output information provided from this merger enables the consultant to make an informed decision about each pest management option, as it pertains to the farm system, and evaluate the tradeoff between minimizing risk to the environment and farm profitability.

Material and methods Cohorts of fishermen's wives from the Swedish east and west coasts were established and linked to the Swedish Medical Birth Register for 1973-1991; 1501 children were born in the eastcoast cohort and 3553 in the westcoast cohort, Comparisons were made with regional populations and between the cohorts. Dietary interviews were made with 69 randomly selected women from the cohorts and 69 referents.        Results The women interviewed from the east- and westcoast cohorts ate locally caught fish more than twice as often as their referents. Compared with the regional population, the women in the eastcoast cohort gave birth to an increased number of infants with low birthweights (<3000 g), whereas the opposite was seen in the westcoast cohort. Infants in the eastcoast cohort had significantly lower birthweights than infants from the westcoast cohort (median 3530 versus 3610 g, P<0.001). Even after adjustment for potential confounders, eastcoast affiliation showed an increased risk for low birthweight (odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.18-1.76). The effect was more conspicuous for boys (odds ratio 1.95) and heavy smokers (odds ratio 3.00).

This study examined the symptom and psychological profiles of 263 older adults (aged 60-90 y, 71% women, 29% men); 57% reported that at least one chemical and 17% reported that at least four of five chemicals (pesticide, automobile exhaust, paint, new carpet, perfume) made them feel ill. Cacosmia ratings correlated weakly and negatively with age (r = - 0.19, p = .001) over the whole sample. Cacosmia correlated significantly with self-reported illness from foods that may mobilize or generate opioid peptides (wheat, dairy, eggs) (r = 0.32, p < .0001) and with illness from opiate drugs (r = 0.23, p < .0001). When the sample was divided into four cells on the basis of above- versus below-median total chemical-induced illness score (CI) and total food-induced illness score (FI), the high CI and high FI, high CI only, and high FI only groups had more frequent indigestion, and the high CI group had more frequent difficulty concentrating than the groups below median for illness from both chemicals and foods (NOILL), even after co-varying for age and anxiety. The most cacosmic subjects noted higher prevalence of physician-diagnosed allergies and irritable bowel than did noncacosmic subjects. In contrast with previous young adult cohort studies, the older illness groups did not differ with regard to sex distribution, depression, shyness, or repressive defensiveness. When considered with prior surveys of young adults, the present findings are consistent with the presence of previously established, time-dependent sensitization to multiple xenobiotic agents in susceptible individuals for whom psychological variables do not explain the symptom of cacosmia. If cacosmia is a symptom of TDS, then the neuropharmacology literature suggests the possibility of excitatory amino acid, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, dopaminergic, and/or opioid involvement.

However, there is limited information on ownership and use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) in areas of Myanmar most severely affected by malaria. We describe ownership and use of ITNs among people in the malaria-endemic eastern parts of Myanmar and factors associated with ITN use.        Methods        A cross-sectional household survey using a multi-stage cluster design was conducted in malaria-endemic townships in eastern Myanmar during the high malaria season of August to September, 2014. An effective ITN was defined as 1) a long-lasting insecticide-treated net obtained within the past three years, or 2) any net treated with insecticide within the past year.        Results        In 4,679 households, the average number of ITNs per household was higher in rural compared to urban areas (0.6 vs. 0.4, p < 0.001) as well as the proportion of households owning at least one ITN (27.3% vs. 15.5%, p < 0.001). The proportion of households in which all members slept under an ITN was also higher in rural compared to urban areas (15.3% vs 6.9%, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, rural households (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.78, 95% CI: 1.43-2.21, p<0.001), households in which respondents knew malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes (aOR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.10-1.65, p = 0.004), and in which respondents knew malaria can be prevented by ITN use (aOR 1.86, 95% CI: 1.28-2.70, p<0.001) were more likely to have all members sleep under an ITN. Compared to the lowest socio- economic quintile, households in the richest quintile were less likely to have all members sleep under an ITN (aOR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.33-0.66, p<0.001). Households in which the main income earner was a skilled worker or a businessman were less likely to have all members sleep under an ITN (aOR, 0.70, 95% CI: 0.52-0.96, p<0.025) compared to those headed by farmers or fishermen. Households in which all children slept under an ITN were more likely to be in rural areas (aOR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.19-2.09, p = 0.002) and have a household head who knew malaria can be prevented by ITN use (aOR 2.13, 95% CI: 1.30-3.50, p = 0.003). Children were less likely to have slept under an ITN in houses headed by skilled workers or businessmen (aOR 0.50, 95% CI: 0.33-0.75, p = 0.001) or unskilled workers (aOR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.89, p = 0.006) compared to households with farmers or fishermen. Higher socio-economic level was associated with lower ITN use by children (aOR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.36-0.88, p = 0.012, highest vs. lowest quintile).        Conclusions        The study found ownership of ITNs was low in Myanmar in comparison to the goal of one for every two household members. Use of ITNs was low even when present. Findings are of concern given the study areas were part of enhanced efforts to reduce artemisinin-resistant malaria. Nonetheless, groups vulnerable to malaria such as individuals in rural settings, lower socio-economic households, and workers in high mosquito exposure jobs, had higher rates of ITN ownership.

In this study, P. clarkii were exposed to 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 mg/L abamectin, immune-and antioxidant-related enzymes activities, genes expression levels, and histological observations were used to analyze the defense capacity of P. clarkii to abamectin. With increasing abamectin concentration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and malondiadehyde (MDA) content increased significantly. Meanwhiile, acid phosphate (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activities, total haemocyte counts (THC), and Crustin expression level decreased significantly, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and GPX expression level also decreased significantly. Hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) observation showed that with increasing abamectin concentration, hepatopancreas were damaged, especially membrane structure. Through TUNEL observation and apoptosis-related genes (PcCTSL, Bcl-2, Bax, BI-1, PcCytc, caspase-3) expression levels, with increasing abamectin concentration, apoptosis rate increased significantly. Results of this study indicated that abamectin caused oxidative damage to P. clarkii, resulting in damage to defense system, sup-pression of nonspecific immunity and antioxidation, and promotion of apoptosis.

To elucidate how broflanilide affects the CNS, we exposed zebrafish larvae to broflanilide at 16.9 and 88.0 mu g/L (the environmentally relevant concentrations) for 120 h. Zebrafish locomotion was significantly disturbed at 88.0 mu g/L, with a decreased moving distance and velocity accompanied by an inhibited neurotransmitter level. In vivo neuroimaging analysis indicated that the nerves of zebrafish larvae, including the axons, myelin sheaths, and neurons, were impaired. The number of neurons was significantly reduced after exposure, with an impaired morphological structure. These changes were accompanied by the abnormal transcription of genes involved in early CNS development. In addition, an increased total number of microglia and an elevated proportion of amoeboid microglia were observed after 88.0 mu g/L broflanilide exposure, pointing out to an upstream role of microglia activation in mediating broflanilide neurotoxicity. Meanwhile, increased inflammatory cytokine levels and brain neutrophil numbers were observed, implicating significant inflammatory response and immune toxicity.

Limited prior research suggests sex-specific effects of prenatal OPE exposures on fetal development. We evaluated overall and sex-specific associations between prenatal OPE exposures and gestational age (GA) at birth and birthweight for gestational age (BW for GA) z-scores among the predominately low-income, Hispanic MADRES cohort.Methods: Nine OPE metabolite concentrations were measured in 421 maternal urine samples collected during a third trimester visit (GA = 31.5 +/- 2.0 weeks). We examined associations between single urinary OPE metabolites and GA at birth and BW for GA z-scores using linear regression models and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and effects from OPE mixtures using Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR). We also assessed sex-specific differences in single metabolite analyses by evaluating statistical interactions and stratifying by sex.Results: We did not find significant associations between individual OPE metabolites and birth outcomes in the full infant sample; however, we found that higher bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP) was associated with earlier GA at birth among male infants (p = 0.04), and a nonlinear, inverted U-shape association between the sum of dibutyl phosphate and di-isobutyl phosphate (DNBP + DIBP) and GA at birth among female infants (p = 0.03). In mixtures analysis, higher OPE metabolite mixture exposures was associated with lower GA at birth, which was primarily driven by female infants. No associations were observed between OPE mixtures and BW for GA z-scores.Conclusion: Higher BDCIPP and DNBP + DIBP concentrations were associated with earlier GA at birth among male and female infants, respectively.

It was observed that nematode application doubled the amount of AKH (Peram-CAH-I and Peram-CAH-II) in the central nervous system of L. decemlineata, indicating mobilization of anti-stress reactions in the body. Furthermore, the external co-application of Peram-CAH-II with the nematode significantly increased beetle mortality (5.6 and 1.8 times, 1 and 2 days after application, respectively). The mechanism underlying this phenomenon was investigated. As the effect on gut characteristics was equivocal, it was assumed that the nematodes profited from the observed mobilization of metabolites from the fat body into the PeramCAH-II-induced hemolymph. This phenomenon supplied nematodes with a more nutrient-dense substrate on which they propagated. Furthermore, Peram-CAH-II lowered vitellogenin expression in the fat body, particularly in males, thus limiting the anti-pathogen defense capacity of the protein.

The framework consists of a set of adaptive management implementation goals (develop effective monitoring practices, develop effective participatory process, and conduct management experiments), a set of aspirational targets hypothesized to be related to Sea Lamprey Control Program adaptive capacity (multi-level political and social organization, creation of safe-to-fail decision making arenas, and effective use of multi-criteria decision analysis), and a feedback loop linking adaptive capacity and progress towards adaptive management implementation goals. Progress towards improving sea lamprey control outcomes by integrating supplemental control strategy into the Sea Lamprey Control Program may be possible through adaptive management implementation.

The PHL also makes assessments on possible abiotic factors affecting plant health. Between January 1 and December 14, 2020, the PHL received 794 samples including Christmas trees, field crops, greenhouse vegetable and floriculture crops, forest nursery seedlings, herbaceous and woody ornamentals, small fruits, tree fruits, nuts, turfgrass and specialty crops for diagnosis. No significantly new or unusually high level of any disease was detected in the samples. METHODS: The BCMAFF Plant Health Laboratory provides diagnoses for diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, plant parasitic nematodes, and insect pests of agricultural crops grown in British Columbia. Samples are submitted to the laboratory by ministry staff, growers, agri-business representatives, crop insurance personnel, municipalities and master gardeners. Crop categories comprising majority of the samples in 2020 included; field vegetables (26.57%) followed by berry crops (18.51%), woody ornamentals (17.12%), tree fruit and grape (7.43%) and forest nursery seedlings (6.29%). All other crops were from 0.5% to up to 5.0% of the total submissions. Diagnoses were accomplished by visual and microscopic examination, culturing onto microbial media, biochemical identification of bacteria using BIOLOG (R) and serological testing of viruses, fungi and bacteria with micro-well and membrane-Molecular techniques (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-conventional and/or real time) were used for some species-specific diagnoses. General primer PCRs (for fungi and bacteria) were followed by sequencing to identify the organism involved. Some specimens were referred to other laboratories for identification or confirmation of the diagnosis.        RESULTS AND COMMENTS: Overall in 2020, British Columbia had mild winter weather conditions in January followed by a severe cold snap in February. The long, mild spring was wet as is normal for B.C. and was followed by a short dry summer. The wet weather in the spring supported bacterial blights on woody ornamentals, tree fruits and berry crops. Fire blight incidence was higher than usually seen in tree fruit as well as woody ornamental crops. Summaries of diseases and their causal/associated agents diagnosed on crop samples submitted to the laboratory are presented in Tables 1 to 13, organized by crop category. Diagnoses not listed include abiotic disorders caused by suspected nutritional stress, pH imbalance, water stress, drought stress, adverse growing/cultural conditions, genetic abnormalities, environmental and chemical stresses including damage from herbicides, fruit abortion due to lack of pollination, insect-related injury, or damage where no conclusive causal factor was identified. More than one disease-causing agent was identified on many samples and are listed under individual disease/symptom. The frequency of diseases diagnosed in the lab does not reflect their prevalence in the field in B.C.

Its presence may cause stress and discomfort to people inhabiting or working the infested areas. In addition, it may cause damage to organic materials, contaminate food and carry microbes. This paper summarizes the available data on its spreading and current distribution of species in Europe and displayed the species is present throughout the continent including Scandinavia. This northward shift of C. longicaudatum might be explained by use of the insulation and central heating to provide optimal climate for the species to establish. The paper also contains updates on the current status of C. longicaudatum in Czechia, United Kingdom, and Ireland, where its first populations were recently detected. Based on the collected data, the spread in the monitored countries continues rapidly, when the domestic settings were the main habitat. Furthermore, the species is often present in accommodation facilities, warehouses, factories, public institutions, shopping malls, archives, museums, and art galleries. Therefore, the study indicates the species may occur everywhere indoors. The paper also highlights an urgent need for establishment of effective pest management strategy and preventive measures. Synanthropic invasive silverfish, Ctenolepisma longicaudatum, has been recently reported to cause nuisance in the indoor environment in many European countries. To get more details on the species distribution, the species occurrence was monitored by the authors in the countries where establishment of C. longicaudatum has been revealed in the last years. In Czechia, 20 findings from 14 municipalities in eight regions were recorded within the last three years. In the United Kingdom, 49 cases, including the first occurrence in Scotland, were recorded. Five cases were recorded for the Republic of Ireland. Domestic settings were the main habitat in the study countries (50.0% for the Czechia and Ireland and 36.8% for the United Kingdom). Regarding C. longicaudatum control, the standard silverfish strategy fails, and the use of insecticidal baits complemented by dust insecticides was suggested as the most promising approach. To reveal presence of C. longicaudatum in Europe, the search of literature, social platforms and databases on invasive species was conducted.

(RCBH), Campesinos Sin Fronteras (CSF), Yuma County Public Health District, and government agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) working on border health issues. The purpose of these efforts is to address community-generated environmental health hazards identified through ongoing coalitions among NAU, and local health care and research institutions.        Objective: We are undertaking joint community/university efforts to examine human exposures to perchlorate and agricultural pesticides. This project also includes the parallel development of a new animal model for investigating the mechanisms of toxicity following a ""one health"" approach. The ultimate goal of this community-engaged effort is to develop interventions to reduce exposures and health impacts of contaminants in Yuma populations.        Methods: All participants completed the informed consent process, which included information on the purpose of the study, a request for access to health histories and medical records, and interviews. The interview included questions related to (1) demographics, (2) social determinants of health, (3) health screening, (4) occupational and environmental exposures to perchlorate and pesticides, and (5) access to health services. Each participant provided a hair sample for quantifying the metals used in pesticides, urine sample for perchlorate quantification, and blood sample for endocrine assays. Modeling will examine the relationships between the concentrations of contaminants and hormones, demographics and social determinants of health, and health status of the study population, including health markers known to be impacted by perchlorate and pesticides.        Results: We recruited 323 adults residing in Yuma County during a 1-year pilot/feasibility study. Among these, 147 residents were patients from either YRMC or RCBH with a primary diagnosis of thyroid disease, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroid cancer, or goiter. The remaining 176 participants were from the general population but with no history of thyroid disorder. The pilot study confirmed the feasibility of using the identified community-engaged protocol to recruit, consent, and collect data from a difficult-to-access, vulnerable population. The demographics of the pilot study population and positive feedback on the success of the community-engaged approach indicate that the project can be scaled up to a broader study with replicable population health findings.        Conclusions: Using a community-engaged approach, the research protocol provided substantial evidence regarding the effectiveness of designing and implementing culturally relevant recruitment and dissemination processes that combine laboratory findings and public health information. Future findings will elucidate the mechanisms of toxicity and the population health effects of the contaminants of concern, as well as provide a new animal model to develop precision medicine capabilities for the population.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  28,10.2196/15864     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),community-engaged research;endocrine disruption;environmental contaminants;health disparities;toxic metal contamination;perchlorates;pesticides;population health;thyroid disease;TOXICITY;STICKLEBACK;Pesticides,NA,NA,health impacts of perchlorate and pesticide exposure protocol for communityengaged research to evaluate environmental toxicants in a us border community

Herein, we investigated the effects of TCPP exposure on zebrafish neurodevelopment and swimming behavior to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity. Under TCPP gradient concentration exposure, the hatching rates were declined by up to 33.3% in 72 hpf, and the malformation rates increased from 15% to 50%. Meanwhile, TCPP led to abnormal behaviors including decreased locomotive activity in the dark and slow/insensitive responses to sound and light stimulation of larvae. TCPP caused excessive apoptosis and ROS accumulation in early embryonic development, with hair cell defects and structural deformity of neuromast. Abnormal expression of neurodevelopment (pax6a, nova1, sox11b, syn2a, foxo3a and robo2) and apoptosis-related genes (baxa, bcl2a and casp8) revealed molecular mechanisms regarding abnormal behavioral and phenotypic symptoms. Chronic TCPP exposure led to anxiety-like behavior and excessive panic, lower capacity for discrimination and risk avoidance, and conditioned place preference in adults. Social interaction tests demonstrated that long-term TCPP stress resulted in unsociable, eccentric, lonely and silent behaviors in adults. Zebrafish memory and cognitive function were severely reduced as concluded fromT-maze tests. Potential mechanisms triggering behavioral abnormality were attributed to histopathological injury of diencephalon, abnormal changes in nerve-related genes at transcription and expression levels, and inhibited activity of AChE by TCPP stress. These findings provide an important reference for risk assessment and early warning to TCPP exposure, and offer insights for prevention/mitigation of pollutant-induced nervous system diseases.

They are associated with mutualistic bacteria in the genus Xenorhabdus for Steinernematidae and Photorhabdus for Heterorhabditidae and are often referred to as the nematode/bacterium complex. The natural habitat of EPNs is the soil where the third-stage infective juveniles (IJs), the only free-living stage, can infect an array of insect hosts. However, the survival of the IJs is affected by various abiotic (i.e., temperature, moisture, soil texture, soil salinity, UV light, oxygen, and pH) and biotic (i.e., natural enemies, omnivores, scavengers, competitors, and plants) factors in the soil. In this review, we summarize the impact of the biotic factors, especially natural enemies, omnivores, scavengers, and competitors against EPNs and conclude that the major predators of the IJs appear to be nematophagous fungi, mites, and collembolans. Omnivores and scavengers, particularly, mites, collembolans, ants and birds, feeding on EPNkilled insects appear to be the major mortality factors on the developing nematodes especially of insects that are 2 days or less post infection. In addition, we discuss the defense mechanisms of EPN IJs against nematophagous fungi, and the protection of the nematode-killed insects by production of the scavenger deterrent factor produced by the mutualistic bacteria against omnivores and scavengers. By understanding the interactions between EPNs and their antagonists we can improve and increase the successful use of EPNs in biological control programs.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  142,10.1016/j.biocontrol.2020.104452     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biological control;Entomopathogenic nematodes;Natural enemies;Entomopathogens;Predators;Scavengers;POLYPHYLLAE ACARI ACARIDAE;ENTOMOGENOUS NEMATODES;NEMATOPHAGOUS FUNGI;PHOTORHABDUS-LUMINESCENS;STEINERNEMA-CARPOCAPSAE;INSECTICIDAL ACTIVITY;BEAUVERIA-BASSIANA;SYMBIOTIC BACTERIA;BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL;NATURAL ENEMIES;Bacteria;Defense Mechanisms,NA,NA,antagonists and defense mechanisms of entomopathogenic nematodes and their mutualistic bacteria

Prior work by us and others has reported sex-specific behavioral deficits in rodents and zebrafish following early life exposure. In an effort to understand the mechanisms by which these behavioral effects occur, here we explored the effects of its constituents on behavioral outcomes previously shown to be altered by developmental FM550 exposure. The FM550 commercial mixture is composed of two brominated compounds (BFR) and two organophosphate compounds (OPFRs) at almost equivalent proportions. Both the BFR and the OPFR components are differentially metabolized and structurally distinct, but similar to known neurotoxicants. Here we examined adult Wistar rat offspring socioemotional behaviors following perinatal exposure (oral, to the dam) to vehicle, 2000 mu g/day FM550, 1000 mu g/day BFR or 1000 mu g/day OPFR from gestation day 0 to weaning. Beginning on postnatal day 65 offspring from all groups were subjected to a series of behavioral tasks including open field, elevated plus maze, marble burying, social interaction tests, and running wheel. Effects were exposure-, sex- and task-specific, with BFR exposure resulting in the most consistent behavioral deficits.

In present studies, Nineteen maize inbreds selected from diverse sources were characterized for resistance traits against shoot fly under its natural infestation using moistened fishmeal. Though the antixenosis to shoot fly for oviposition was not observed in the test genotypes. But, the presence of significant variation in the deadhearts incidence revealed the existence of relative amount of resistance among the test genotypes. The Tolerance (measured in the terms of less proportion of deadhearts out of total shoot fly incidence (leaf injury + deadhearts)) and Antibiosis (in terms of larval and pupal weight, duration and survival) were recognized as key mechanisms of this resistance. Tolerance to shoot fly was significantly more in resistant inbreds, SO1SHYQBBB13B, HK12-6-2-4, DMSC 28, CM 143 and Winpop 8 (29.46-36.56%) in comparison to the susceptible genotypes SE 563 and LM 16 (46.31-47.44%). The correlation and stepwise regression analyses revealed that the more seedling vigor, less leaf area, less number of leaves and thin stem had significant impact on the shoot fly deadhearts incidence and provided resistance against this pest. The total soluble sugars (TSS), proteins and amino acids were significantly higher in the susceptible inbreds; whereas, total phenols and tannins; and activities of defensive enzymes viz. phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were significantly higher in resistant inbreds. Further, the stepwise regression revealed that the larval period, per cent pupation, pupal weight female, pupal weight male and adult emergence of shoot fly were significantly influenced by PAL activity, which explained 71.5, 82.9, 47.0, 29.8 and 39.9% of their total variation, respectively.

The sequence of the peptide, which was named Octominin, had characteristic features of known antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as a positive charge (+5), high hydrophobic residue ratio (43%), and 1.86 kcal/mol of Boman index. Octominin was predicted to have an alpha-helix secondary structure. The synthesized Octominin was 2625.2 Da with 92.5% purity. The peptide showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of 50 and 200 mu g/mL, respectively, against Candida albicans. Field emission scanning electron microscopy observation confirmed that Octominin caused ultrastructural cell wall deformities in C. albicans. In addition, propidium iodide penetrated the Octominin-treated C. albicans cells, further demonstrating loss of cell membrane integrity that caused cell death at both MIC and MFC. Octominin treatment increased the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and decreased cell viability in a concentration dependent manner. Cytotoxicity assays revealed no significant influence of Octominin on the viability of human embryonic kidney 293T cell line, with over 95% live cells in the Octominin-treated group observed up to 100 mu g/mL.

However, amidst sweeping reforms in prescribed best practices for food safety, growers were pressured to take precautionary approaches to control pathogenic contamination-suppressing wildlife near fields, removing habitat, restricting biological soil amendments (e.g., compost, manure), and most recently, chemically treating irrigation water-that may generate negative unintended consequences for environmental and social sustainability. We synthesize socio-ecological data from three qualitative, interview-based studies to examine grower perceptions and experiences of food safety reforms in California's Central Coast region and explore the effects of food safety regulations on environmental and socio-economic sustainability. We identify three disjunctures between food safety requirements and farming realities in practice: (1) Growers perceive that some food safety practices legitimately mitigate risk, while others fail to reduce or even accentuate risk; (2) Food safety requirements can create contradictions in the co-management of food safety and environmental sustainability; and (3) Food safety requirements may foster impediments to regional food systems socioeconomic sustainability.

The results showed that multistage branches of tendrils ensured that the plants could climb higher to strive for better photosynthetic opportunities. The single fleshy fruit of the infructescence was carpeted with slender white spines on which dense barbs were arranged, which could defend fruits against herbivores and contributed to long-distance dispersal. There would be beaklike lignified thorn forming to continue spreading when most of the barbed spines fell off during the fruit season. Rootstock was found in this herbaceous vine, which could accumulate various storage substances during development and helped the plants spread in harsh conditions.

Furthermore, the lifecycle of S. sclerotiorum in soybean fields is highly dependent on weather conditions, leading to a highly sporadic occurrence of the disease over seasons and an aggregated distribution within fields. Management relies on a multi-pronged approach of combining partially resistant cultivars with cultural practices, such as altering row spacing and planting population, along with chemical control. These control measures are constrained by economic trade-offs, incomplete efficacy of chemicals, and a lack of understanding of application timing for fungicides.

The antimalarial activity of M. charantia leaf aqueous extract and TiO2 NPs were evaluated against CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ sensitive (CQ-s) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. IC50 of M. charantia leaf aqueous extract were 83.64 mg/ml (CQ-s) and 88.14 mg/ml (CQ-r). Synthesized TiO2 NPs achieved IC50 of 53.42 mg/ml (CQ-s) and 59.71 mg/ml (CQ-r). The TiO2 NPs did not exhibit any noticeable toxicity on Poecilia reticulata after 24 h of exposure. Overall, our results suggest that the synthesized TiO2 NPs may be employed to develop newer and safer agents for malaria control.

The holobiont concept suggests that the genetic basis of such adaptation may not only lie within their genomes, but additionally in their associated microbes. To explore this, we generated shotgun DNA sequencing datasets of the facial skin and large intestine microbiomes of the black vulture (Coragyps atratus) and the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura). We characterized the functional potential and taxonomic diversity of their microbiomes, the potential pathogenic challenges confronted by vultures, and the microbial taxa and genes that could play a protective role on the facial skin and in the gut.        Results: We found microbial taxa and genes involved in diseases, such as dermatitis and pneumonia (more abundant on the facial skin), and gas gangrene and food poisoning (more abundant in the gut). Interestingly, we found taxa and functions with potential for playing beneficial roles, such as antilisterial bacteria in the gut, and genes for the production of antiparasitics and insecticides on the facial skin. Based on the identified phages, we suggest that phages aid in the control and possibly elimination, as in phage therapy, of microbes reported as pathogenic to a variety of species. Interestingly, we identified Adineta vaga in the gut, an invertebrate that feeds on dead bacteria and protozoans, suggesting a defensive predatory mechanism. Finally, we suggest a colonization resistance role through biofilm formation played by Fusobacteria and Clostridia in the gut.        Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of complementing genomic analyses with metagenomics in order to obtain a clearer understanding of the host-microbial alliance and show the importance of microbiome-mediated health protection for adaptation to extreme diets, such as scavenging.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  36     Total Times Cited:  41     Cited Reference Count:  94,10.1186/s13028-018-0415-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Colonization resistance;Diet specialization;Metagenomics;Microbiome;Pathogens;Scavenging;Vulture;RNA GENE DATABASE;SALMONELLA-TYPHIMURIUM;IDENTIFICATION;CARNOBACTERIUM;RESISTANCE;EVOLUTION;EMPHASIS;RESOURCE;PATHOGEN;GENOME;Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Skin,NA,NA,protective role of the vulture facial skin and gut microbiomes aid adaptation to scavenging

This is particularly so for fungal pathogens, which can occupy several niches in the host. We developed an infection model of talaromycosis in zebrafish embryos with the thermally-dimorphic intracellular fungal pathogen Talaromyces marneffei and used it to define different roles of neutrophils and macrophages in infection establishment. This system models opportunistic human infection prevalent in HIV-infected patients, as zebrafish embryos have intact innate immunity but, like HIV-infected talaromycosis patients, lack a functional adaptive immune system. Importantly, this new talaromycosis model permits thermal shifts not possible in mammalian models, which we show does not significantly impact on leukocyte migration, phagocytosis and function in an established Aspergillus fumigatus model. Furthermore, the optical transparency of zebrafish embryos facilitates imaging of leukocyte/pathogen interactions in vivo. Following parenteral inoculation, T. marneffei conidia were phagocytosed by both neutrophils and macrophages. Within these different leukocytes, intracellular fungal form varied, indicating that triggers in the intracellular milieu can override thermal morphological determinants. As in human talaromycosis, conidia were predominantly phagocytosed by macrophages rather than neutrophils. Macrophages provided an intracellular niche that supported yeast morphology. Despite their minor role in T. marneffei conidial phagocytosis, neutrophil numbers increased during infection from a protective CSF3-dependent granulopoietic response. By perturbing the relative abundance of neutrophils and macrophages during conidial inoculation, we demonstrate that the macrophage intracellular niche favours infection establishment by protecting conidia from a myeloperoxidase-dependent neutrophil fungicidal activity. These studies provide a new in vivo model of talaromycosis with several advantages over previous models. Our findings demonstrate that limiting T. marneffei's opportunity for macrophage parasitism and thereby enhancing this pathogen's exposure to effective neutrophil fungicidal mechanisms may represent a novel host-directed therapeutic opportunity.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  45     Total Times Cited:  48     Cited Reference Count:  95,10.1371/journal.ppat.1007063     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PENICILLIUM-MARNEFFEI;ASPERGILLUS-FUMIGATUS;CANDIDA-ALBICANS;ZEBRAFISH MODEL;HISTOPLASMA-CAPSULATUM;TRANSGENIC ZEBRAFISH;G-CSF;CELL;REVEALS;GROWTH;Macrophages;Peroxidase,NA,NA,macrophages protect <i>talaromyces marneffei<i> conidia from myeloperoxidasedependent neutrophil fungicidal activity during infection establishment <i>in vivo<i>

It is typical of many agricultural pests, with insecticides remaining the most common method of control, despite frequent cases of resistance in pest populations and the potential for other management options such as natural enemies to provide suppression. Here we review scope to make better use of neglected natural enemy taxa and integrate recent work on landscape ecology to identify opportunities for more effective pest suppression. Our main findings are as follows: (1) relatively neglected taxa of natural enemies, especially predators and entomopathogens, are now attracting growing levels of research interest, although parasitoids remain most frequently used and researched; (2) knowledge of the spatio-temporal dynamics of populations at the landscape scale have advanced rapidly in the last decade; (3) ecological insights open new possibilities for exploiting spatial heterogeneity at scales larger than individual fields and even farms that influence pests and their natural enemies; (4) there is evidence for landscapes that selectively favor particular guilds and this knowledge could be developed to favor targeted natural enemies over pests in focal crops; and (5) landscape-scale effects can even over-ride field-scale management practices. The significance of these advances is that future management of diamondback moth and similar pests will benefit from a move away from reliance on the use of particular species of biological control agents, especially exotic parasitoids, and strategies that depend on use of broad-spectrum insecticides. Together with this move, we call for greater use of area-wide management that exploits the potential of landscapes to promote diverse assemblages of natural enemy species.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  19     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  149,10.1007/s13593-018-0500-z     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plutella xylostella;Conservation biological control;Habitat management;Donor habitat;Landscape connectivity;Area-wide management;Bacillus thuringiensis;Entomopathogen;Predator;Parasitoid;CONSERVATION BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL;PLUTELLA-XYLOSTELLA LEPIDOPTERA;INDIRECT PLANT DEFENSE;ENTOMOPATHOGENIC FUNGI;NATURAL ENEMIES;BEAUVERIA-BASSIANA;BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS;INSECT PESTS;STEINERNEMA-CARPOCAPSAE;METARHIZIUM-ANISOPLIAE,NA,NA,landscape ecology and expanding range of biocontrol agent taxa enhance prospects for diamondback moth management a review

Preservation and evaluation of biological diversity components in various spatial scales (from global to local levels), becomes an important element of strategic documents and legislation in the domain of environmental protection, economic development, well-being of humanity, and etc. (for example: Millennium development goals, Sustainable development strategy). After the Convention on Biological Diversity entered into force, the concept of biodiversity which, in simplified words, represents ""universality and the most diverse variability aspects of life on planet Earth"", was finally put into use in 1992. By ratifying the Convention on Biological Diversity all signatory states took the obligation to bring legal acts and establish necessary activities regarding the protection and evaluation of biodiversity. During the past two decades the initial concepts from the Convention have been progressively upgraded which facilitates the use of complex tasks of preserving biodiversity and sustainable use of biological resources through a series of important complementary strategic and operational documents.        Among the most important newly established concepts is defining Ecosystem services as the key theoretical approach and a practical mechanism for comprehensive evaluation of real importance of biodiversity preservation for mankind existence, ie. well-being which every human society has (or could have) in various sectors and aspects of life. This concept prioritizes ecosystem approach and in that way integrates a series of questions which weren't resolved in an adequately clear way in the Convention or other documents which are related to the preservation and protection of biodiversity. The application of ecosystem services concept offers a series of operational solutions for connecting special (to a lesser extent genetic) diversity with the functioning of the ecosystem. Even more important is the contribution to methodology of economic, as well as ""immaterial"" evaluation of various elements and processes in ecosystems, which, in a direct or an indirect way, contribute to the concrete and measurable parameters of economic growth, social wealth, goods and benefits that people have from preserved and functional ecosystems, populations or biodiversity in general. Consequently, this approach also enables an economic valorization of losses which occur or are expected to occur in case of degradation of biodiversity components.        Comprehensive classification and fundamental elaboration of the concepts and methods of ecosystem services quantification was realized within the mega-study ""Millennium Ecosystem Assessment"" (2001-2005).        Ecosystem services were, in simplified words, defines as ""benefits that people have from the ecosystem"", and were grouped in: services of supplying/providing, regulation, cultural and supporting services. With later elaboration of classification the methodology of economic valorization was significantly improved, primarily through international iniciatives ""The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity - TEEB) and ""Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services - CICES). The most significant specific application of this approach in European conditions is realized through the ""Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services - MAES initiative, which represents one of the key contributions to the ""European Union Biodiversity Strategy 2020"", ie., the obligation of all members through the 2010-2020 decade.        In our national legislative, as in the biggest part of activities realized by line ministries during the past two decades, the concept of ecosystem services was represented in very small amounts, ie. in disproportion with the importance it has had in world and Europe after 2005 (with the exception of the National strategy for sustainable use of natural resources and goods, 2012). The basic approach to economic valorization of biodiversity has been connected to the term ""biological resources"" (including genetic resources), which came from direct elaboration of these concepts defined in the 1992 Convention. This paper will show the basic elements of mentioned concepts and programs, their connection to the so far practice in Serbia, and the possibilities and needs for implementing the newest international approaches into the valorization of fauna, as a segment of Serbian biodiversity, as well as big problems which have been noticed in the so far practice in biological resources usage (uncontrollable and law prohibited fishery, excessive hunting, destruction of habitats, excessive use of pesticides in agriculture, pollution, unplanned urbanization with area conversion, etc.). An insufficient connection of line ministries in achieving biodiversity protection and misunderstanding and/or ignoring the significance of ecosystem services for society have also been highlighted.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  21,,,NA,NA,preservation and evaluation of biodiversity the concept of ecosystem services and biological resources of fauna

It proposes the uses of eucalyptus oil and cedarwood oil as a natural insecticide. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the application of developed microcapsules to impart insect repellency on textile substrate.        Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an experimental study using two essential oils and gum in formations of microcapsules through a simple coaseravtion encapsulation technique. The developed solution was analyzed, including confirmation of size and structure through. Application of developed finish on substrate was also undertaken to prove better ability as repellent fabric.        Findings - The paper highlights useful invention of microencapsulated fabric developed with the combination of gum acacia and eucalyptus oil as core and shell material. The developed fabric has better ability to repel silverfish as compared to microencapsulated fabric developed with gum acacia (shell) and cedarwood oil (core).        Research limitations/implications - Due to the lack of time and less availability of essential oils, only two oils were used to test the insect repellent behavior.        Practical implications - This paper fulfills an identified need, it includes implications for the development of a very useful natural insecticide to repel silverfish (Lepisma saccharina) insect. This insect is a very common problem found in cloth wardrobes and bookshelves; it mainly attacks the fabric with cellulosic content and starch.

These molecules are thought to be a safer alternative to classical plant protection products. Given that innate immune systems share common features in plants and vertebrates, PDS can potentially cross-react with innate immunity of non-target organisms. To test this hypothesis, we studied effects of the commercial PDS Stifenia (FEN560), which is composed of crushed fenugreek seeds. We tested various concentrations of Stifenia (0.03-1 mg mL-1) on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and checked, 20 h later, cell metabolic activity (MA) using XTT assay, cell death by flow cytometry analysis, and IL-1 beta inflammatory cytokine released in the culture medium using ELISA. Stifenia induced a general decrease of the cell MA, which was concomitant with a dose-dependent release of IL-1 beta. Our results highlight the activation of human immune cells. The inflammatory effect of Stifenia was partially inhibited by pan-caspase inhibitor. Accordingly, Stifenia induced the release of p20 caspase-1 fragment into the culture medium suggesting the involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, we observed that Stifenia can induce cell death. We also tested the effect of Stifenia on Zebrafish larvae. After 24 h of exposure, Stifenia induced a dose-dependent IL-1 beta and TNF alpha gene expression.

We experimentally manipulated the diet of the economically and ecologically important blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, to approximate the effects of a dietary shift from primarily animal to plant tissue, a phenomenon commonly documented in crabs. Crabs whose diet consisted exclusively of animal tissue had markedly lower mortality and consumed substantially more food than crabs whose diet consisted exclusively of seaweed. The quantity of food consumed had a significant positive influence on reproductive effort and long-term energy stores. Additionally, seaweed diets produced a three-fold decrease in hepatopancreas lipid content and a simultaneous two-fold increase in crab aggression when compared to an animal diet. Our results reveal that the consumption of animal tissue substantially enhanced C. sapidus fitness, and suggest that a dietary shift to plant tissue may reduce crab population growth by decreasing fecundity as well as increasing mortality.

Initial evaluation of more than 500 high-throughput (HT) microwell-based assays without metabolic activation showed that most lacked high specificity and sensitivity for detecting genotoxicants. Thus, EPA initiated a pilot project to investigate the use of standard genotoxicity endpoints using medium-throughput genotoxicity (MTG) assays in the context of a large testing program. Twenty-five chemicals were selected from the ToxCast program based in part on their known genotoxicity. The two MTG assays used were the Ames II assay and 96-well In Vitro MicroFlow((R)) Micronucleus (MN) assay. The Ames II assay showed a reasonable correlation with published Ames test data and industry submissions, though specificity was much better than sensitivity due to restraints on top concentrations as prescribed by ToxCast. Overall concordance was 73% both with and without metabolic activation. The flow MN assay had concordances of 71% and 58% with and without metabolic activation, respectively, when compared to published data and submissions. Importantly, a comparison of results without S9 from the MTG assays to an HT ToxCast p53 activation assay showed a fairly good degree of concordance (67%). The results reported here indicate that assays for genotoxicity endpoints can be conducted in a MT format and have the potential to add to the interpretation of results from large-scale testing programs such as EPA's ToxCast program.

This is extremely serious because India supports 18% of the world's human population and 15% of the world's livestock population, but has only 2.4% of the world's land area. Despite its low proportional land area, India ranks second worldwide in farm output. Agriculture, forestry, and fisheries account for 17% of the gross domestic product and employs about 50% of the total workforce of the country. Causes of soil degradation are both natural and human-induced. Natural causes include earthquakes, tsunamis, droughts, avalanches, landslides, volcanic eruptions, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires. Human-induced soil degradation results from land clearing and deforestation, inappropriate agricultural practices, improper management of industrial effluents and wastes, over-grazing, careless management of forests, surface mining, urban sprawl, and commercial/industrial development. Inappropriate agricultural practices include excessive tillage and use of heavy machinery, excessive and unbalanced use of inorganic fertilizers, poor irrigation and water management techniques, pesticide overuse, inadequate crop residue and/or organic carbon inputs, and poor crop cycle planning.

Nematodes used in these insecticides owe their properties to the presence of symbiotic bacteria. Representatives of two genera - Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus can be found in the digestive tracts of, respectively, Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae nematodes. Nematodes have a number of properties, allowing them to penetrate the host integument, breaking the immune defenses, multiplicating in his body, killing the host and finally producing invasive forms, viable in the external environment. Bacterial symbionts are responsible for some of these abilities, since they produce toxins lethal to the victim and maintain adequate conditions for the development of their vectors. The bacteria are an example of one organism living in another as a symbiont, and functioning as a pathogen for another one. The relationship nematodes-mutualistic bacteria-insect is formed.

Recent molecular evidence suggests that humpback dolphins in the Bay of Bengal may comprise a fifth species. These moderate-sized dolphin species are found in shallow (<30 m), coastal waters of the eastern Atlantic, Indian, and western Pacific oceans. Abundance and trends have only been studied in a few areas, mostly in eastern Africa, China, and northern Australia. No global, empirically derived abundance estimates exist for any of the four species, but none appear to number more than about 20,000 individuals. Humpback dolphins feed mostly on small fishes, and sometimes shrimps; occur for the most part in small groups (mostly 12 or less); have limited near-shore movements; and in most parts of their range exhibit a fission/fusion type of social organization. Major threats that affect all the species are entanglement in fishing gear, and habitat degradation/destruction from various forms of coastal development. Impacts from vessel traffic (including behavioural disturbance and displacement, as well as mortality and morbidity from collisions with vessels) appear to be significant in most areas. Several other threats are apparently significant only in particular parts of the range of some species (e.g. high levels of organochlorine contaminants affecting Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in Hong Kong). Direct hunting only occurs in limited areas and primarily on a small scale. Conservation actions so far have been limited, with most populations receiving little study and almost no management attention. Much more work is needed on humpback dolphin population status, threats, and how the major threats can be reduced or eliminated. Extinction risks for the four species and some populations are preliminarily re-assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria in the current volume. The results suggest that all four species in the genus are threatened at some level (suggested Red List status ranges from Vulnerable for S. chinensis and S. sahulensis to Critically Endangered for S. teuszii).",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  32     Total Times Cited:  34     Cited Reference Count:  58,10.1016/bs.amb.2015.04.001     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),RED LIST CRITERIA;PEARL RIVER ESTUARY;SOUTH-AFRICA;CONSERVATION STATUS;ALGOA BAY;POPULATION-SIZE;HONG-KONG;CHINENSIS;TEUSZII;PLUMBEA,NA,NA,humpback dolphins a brief introduction to the genus <i>sousa<i>

It was observed that disease can develop on lettuce plants inoculated with dry ascospores in the absence of apparent leaf wetness (required for spore germination). To explain this, the model conceptualises an infection court area containing microsites (in leaf axils and close to the stem base) where conditions are conducive to infection, the size of which is modified by ambient RH. The model indicated that minimum, maximum and optimum temperatures for ascospore germination were 0.0, 29.9 and 21.7 degrees C respectively and that maximum rates of disease development occurred at spore densities >87 spores cm(-2). Disease development was much more rapid at 80-100% RH at 20 degrees C, compared to 50-70% RH and resulted in a greater proportion of lettuce plants infected. Disease development was also more rapid at 15-27 degrees C compared to 5-10 degrees C (85% RH). The model was validated by a further series of independent controlled environment experiments where both RH and temperature were varied and generally simulated the pattern of disease development well. The implications of the results in terms of Sclerotinia disease forecasting are discussed.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  59     Total Times Cited:  66     Cited Reference Count:  39,10.1371/journal.pone.0094049     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),WHITE MOLD;STEM ROT;CARPOGENIC GERMINATION;SPATIAL PATTERN;LEAVES;EPIDEMIOLOGY;APOTHECIA;EQUATION;RELEASE;Temperature,NA,NA,a model for <i>sclerotinia sclerotiorum<i> infection and disease development in lettuce based on the effects of temperature relative humidity and ascospore density

Various stressors have been implicated as contributory factors, including increased bottom temperatures, extensive eutrophication with commensurate hypoxia, storm-induced thermal destratification, possible exposures to pesticides and metals, and fishery-induced stressors. Such stressors increase host susceptibility by weakening the host immune defenses and act to increase the transmission and severity of pathogens. The lobster mortality in western LIS in 1999 was linked to Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis, but a complex of stressors resulted in outright mortality from hypoxia or consequent immune suppression that increased susceptibility to the ameba. Similar stressors have been implicated in the etiology of epizootic shell disease and calcinosis. The role of environmental stressors has been hard to delineate, but recent declines in landings indicate that epizootic shell disease has had a negative impact on the lobster population in LIS. Calcinosis, blindness, and hepatopancreatitis are indicators of continued exposure to anthropogenic stressors, but their etiologies remain undetermined.

In addition, potential of SAR (systemic acquired resistance) induced by the chitosans and acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) was assessed against the disease. The degree of N-deacetylation (DN) and the molecular weight of chitosans A, B and C were 85%-1129 kDa, 95%-521 kDa and 75%-607 kDa, respectively. The concentrations 2 g/L and 5 g/L of all chitosans were significantly able to decrease mycelial growth, sclerotia formation and carpogenic germination of the pathogen. Four hours and three days before inoculation with the pathogen, application of chitosans and ASA reduced severity of carrot rot in all isolates. However, mycelial growth and sclerotia formation of isolate 2 was more reduced than other isolates. In accordance with in vitro tests, chitosan B showed the highest inhibitory efficacy against the disease. The fungicidal effect of chitosan increased when the DN decreased and there was a negative correlation between the mycelial growth inhibition and the molecular weight of chitosans.

Parental effects, a common type of transgenerational effect, are non-genetic influences on offspring phenotype that result from parental phenotypes or environments. Little is known, however, about how parental exposure to a stressor effects offspring responses to other stressors despite this type of multi-stressor scenario being common. To better understand the role that parental effects have on offspring contaminant tolerance, we raised freshwater snails, Biomphalaria glabrata, in the presence or absence of predator threat (crayfish + crushed snail) for 12 weeks. Predators are common stressors in aquatic systems and can co-occur with chemical contaminants. We then collected egg masses from parental snails and exposed their offspring to cadmium and malathion survival challenges. Snails raised in the presence of predator threat displayed indicators of stress, including increased time to first reproduction, lower production of egg masses per snail per day and fewer eggs per egg mass, and had smaller shell lengths at 6.5 weeks old compared to snails not exposed to predator threat. Parental exposure to predator threat increased the cadmium tolerance of offspring but did not affect malathion tolerance. These results may have important implications for understanding effects of multiple stressors and indicate that the parental environment can influence responses to contaminants in offspring.

Some important control interventions (e.g. long-lasting insecticidal nests) have contributed to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality in different parts of the world. Moreover, the development and effective use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) hold promise to further enhance the control and elimination of malaria, particularly in areas where health services are deficient. The aim of this study was to determine knowledge, attitudes, practices and beliefs in relation to RDTs for malaria in rural Cote d'Ivoire.        Methods: One hundred individuals from Bozi and Yoho who sought care at the health centre in Bozi and were offered an RDT for malaria were interviewed in April 2010 using a pre-tested questionnaire on practice and perceptions in relation to RDTs for malaria. The relationships between acceptance of RDTs and factors related to opinions were identified, using generalized linear mixed models. Qualitative data from open-ended questions complemented the quantitative analysis.        Results: Only 34 out of 100 patients who were offered an RDT for malaria were willing to undergo the test. People who perceived blood as a sacred body fluid were less likely to comply with an RDT. The concurrent availability and use of RDTs for HIV and malaria was associated with an unwilling attitude towards RDTs for malaria (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.001). The initial willingness of patients to accept malaria testing with RDTs was significantly related to general fear and wanting to know malaria infection status. For further and regular use of RDTs, a strong relationship was observed between acceptance and the idea that an RDT is a pretext used by health worker to know HIV status (odds ratio (OR) = 16.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-268.5). Those thinking that blood samples were useful for medical diagnoses were 8.31-times (95% CI = 2.22-31.1) more likely to undergo an RDT compared to those rejecting blood sampling as a diagnostic strategy.        Conclusion: Socio-cultural factors might be barriers for accepting RDTs in general health services. There are social representations of malaria and HIV/AIDS, symbolic for blood or experiences in relation to blood taking and blood-related diseases in relation to the introduction and routine use of RDTs. Special attention should be given to these barriers as otherwise the promotion of RDTs for prompt and effective diagnosis and subsequent management of malaria is hampered.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  19     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  51,10.1186/1471-2458-12-1089     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Malaria;Rapid diagnostic test;Blood;Blood-related disease;Social representation;HIV;Cote d'Ivoire;CASE-MANAGEMENT;OUTPATIENT TREATMENT;FALCIPARUM-MALARIA;HEALTH-WORKERS;BURKINA-FASO;CHILDREN;RELIABILITY;ACCEPTANCE;MICROSCOPY;FACILITIES,NA,NA,willingness to use a rapid diagnostic test for malaria in a rural area of central cote divoire

Transcript sequence data obtained using Illumina's first generation sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) were mapped to the transcriptome assemblies to estimate transcript representation in different SBS libraries. SBS libraries included a S. homoeocarpa culture control, a creeping bentgrass uninoculated control, and a library for creeping bentgrass inoculated with S. homoeocarpa and incubated for 96 h. A Fisher's exact test was performed to determine transcripts that were significantly different during creeping bentgrass infection with S. homoeocarpa. Fungal transcripts of interest included glycosyl hydrolases, proteases, and ABC transporters. Of particular interest were the large number of glycosyl hydrolase transcripts that target a wide range of plant cell wall compounds, corroborating the suggested wide host range and saprophytic abilities of S. homoeocarpa. Several of the multidrug resistance ABC transporters may be important for resistance to both fungicides and plant defense compounds. Creeping bentgrass transcripts of interest included germins, ubiquitin transcripts involved in proteasome degradation, and cinnamoyl reductase, which is involved in lignin production.

Currently, flame retardants and plasticizers are the two largest market segments for organophosphate esters and they are found in a wide variety of products, including electronics, building materials, vehicles, furniture, car seats, plastics, and textiles. As a result, or-ganophosphate esters and their metabolites are routinely found in human urine, blood, placental tissue, and breast milk across the globe. It has been asserted that their neurological effects are minimal given that they do not act on AChE in precisely the same way as organophosphate ester pesticides. OBJECTIVES: This commentary describes research on the non-AChE neurodevelopmental toxicity of organophosphate esters used as flame retardants and plasticizers (OPEs). Studies in humans, mammalian, nonmammalian, and in vitro models are presented, and relevant neurodevelopmental path-ways, including adverse outcome pathways, are described. By highlighting this scientific evidence, we hope to elevate the level of concern for wide-spread human exposure to these OPEs and to provide recommendations for how to better protect public health. DISCUSSION: Collectively, the findings presented demonstrate that OPEs can alter neurodevelopmental processes by interfering with noncholinergic pathways at environmentally relevant doses. Application of a pathways framework indicates several specific mechanisms of action, including perturbation of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid and disruption of the endocrine system. The effects may have implications for the development of cognitive and social skills in children. Our conclusion is that concern is warranted for the developmental neurotoxicity of OPE exposure. We thus describe important con-siderations for reducing harm and to provide recommendations for government and industry decision makers. © 2021, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

However, few data about its potential toxicity has been reported. Aim of the study: Plant proteins can perform essential roles in survival, acting as defense mechanism, as well functioning as important molecular reserves for its natural metabolism. The aim of the current study was to investigate the in vitro toxicity profile of protein extract of S. saponaria and detect protein potentially involved in biological effects such as collagen hydrolysis and inhibition of viral proteases. Materials and methods: Protein extract of soapberry seeds was investigated for its cytotoxic and genotoxic action using the Ames test. The protein extract was also subjected to a partial purification process of a protease and a protease inhibitor by gel chromatography filtration techniques and the partially isolated proteins were characterized biochemically. Results: Seed proteins extract of S. saponaria was evaluated until 100 μg/mL concentration, presenting cytotoxicity and mutagenicity in bacterial model mostly when exposed to exogenous metabolic system and causing cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in HepG2 cells. The purification and partial characterization of a serine protease (43 kDa) and a cysteine protease inhibitor (32.8 kDa) from protein extract of S. Saponaria, corroborate the idea of ​​the biological use of the plant as an insecticide and larvicide. Although it shows cytotoxic, mutagenic and genotoxic effects.

Moreover, since at least seven families of 5-HT receptors exist in vertebrates, the role of specific receptors is still debated. Aversive stimuli can be classified as indicators of proximal, distal, or potential threat, initiating responses that are appropriate for each of these threat levels. Responses to potential threat usually involve cautious exploration and increased alertness, while responses to distal and proximal threat involve a fight-flight-freeze reaction. We exposed adult zebrafish to a conspecific alarm substance (CAS) and observed behavior during (distal threat) and after (potential threat) exposure, and treated with the 5-HT2C receptor agonists MK-212 or WAY-161503 or with the antagonist RS-102221. The agonists blocked CAS-elicited defensive behavior (distal threat), but not post-exposure increases in defensive behavior (potential threat), suggesting inhibition of responses to distal threat. MK-212 blocked changes in freezing elicited by acute restraint stress, a model of proximal threat, while RS-102221 blocked changes in geotaxis elicited this stressor.

Methods: This prospective study included patients who met the discharge criteria during hospitalization at the department of respiratory medicine of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University from March to December 2017 (no pharmacists involved) and from March 2018 to January 2019 (pharmacists involved). The adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting rate, the average DDD number of antibacterial drugs, the per capita cost of pharmaceutical services, and the benefit-cost ratio (B/C) were analyzed. Results and Discussion: Eighty participants were enrolled during the traditional period and eighty-five participants during the clinical pharmacist period. The average hospital stays (9.2±0.4 vs 10.7±0.6 days, P=0.032), the total cost of hospitalization expenses (¥ 14,058±826 vs ¥ 18,765±1434, P=0.004), the total cost of drugs (¥ 5717±449 vs ¥ 8002±755, P=0.004), and cost of antimicrobial drugs (¥ 3639±379 vs ¥ 5636±641, P=0.007) were all lower in the clinical pharmacist group than in the traditional group. The B/C was 10.38 and 5.05 in the total cost of hospitalization expenses and the total cost of drugs, respectively. The clinical pharmacists’ participation was independently associated with the total cost of hospitalization expenses (β=−0.201, 95% confidence interval: −0.390, −0.055, P=0.010).

Nevertheless, their biodiversity and the versatility of bioactive metabolites have not been fully explored. Hence, the aim of the present study was to investigate the potentials of gut associated bacteria from a marine crab for the production of novel antibacterial compound. Methods: Aerobic gut autochthonous bacteria isolated from marine crab (Lissocarinus orbicularis) collected from Pazhayar coastal area in Nagapattinam district of Tamil Nadu, India were screened for antibacterial activity. Optimization for bacterial growth and antimicrobial compound production, extraction, purification and characterization were studied. Results: In the present study, eight morphologically distinct colonies of L. orbicularis gut associated aerobic bacterial isolates (Iso1-Iso8) on Zobell marine agar plate were selected. Isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity against human bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella paratyphi, Vibrio cholera, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila and Listeria monocytogenes. On the basis of screening results, isolate 5 (Iso5) was selected as the most potential strain and identified as Paenibacillus polymyxa using biochemical and 16S rRNA sequencing methods. The sequence data was submitted to NCBI (Gene bank Accession No: MK583465). Optimization of P. polymyxa for growth and antimicrobial compound production revealed incubation period (36 h), agitation (150 rpm), pH 8.0, 35 °C, 2.5% salinity, 2% glucose and 1% yeast extract as carbon and nitrogen sources respectively were the ideal conditions and mass culture was done with these parameters. Antimicrobial compound from the cell free supernatant of mass culture medium was extracted using ethanol. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 16 μg/ml was observed against of both V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae. GC–MS analysis of the active ethanol fraction showed the presence of different components such as dodecane (96.72%), Tridecane (1.69%), Undecane, 2,6-dimethyl- (1.69%), Tetradecane (1.12%) and Dodecane, 2,6,11-trimethyl- (1.12%). Conclusion: The present study showed that the gut associated autochthonous bacteria of marine crabs are one of the potential sources of antibacterial compound.

Corresponding regulatory hazard assessments are costly, time consuming and require large numbers of non-human animal studies. Currently, predictive toxicology of development compounds relies on their chemical structure and provides little insights into toxicity mechanisms that precede adverse effects. Using the zebrafish embryo model, we characterized transcriptomic responses to a range of sublethal concentrations of six nerve- and muscle-targeting insecticides with different MoA (abamectin, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, fipronil, imidacloprid & methoxychlor). Our aim was to identify affected biological processes and suitable biomarker candidates for MoA-specific signatures. Abamectin showed the most divergent signature among the tested insecticides, linked to lipid metabolic processes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after imidacloprid exposure were primarily associated with immune system and inflammation. In total, 222 early responsive genes to either MoA were identified, many related to three major processes: (1) cardiac muscle cell development and functioning (tcap, desma, bag3, hspb1, hspb8, flnca, myoz3a, mybpc2b, actc2, tnnt2c), (2) oxygen transport and hypoxic stress (alas2, hbbe1.1, hbbe1.3, hbbe2, hbae3, igfbp1a, hif1al) and (3) neuronal development and plasticity (npas4a, egr1, btg2, ier2a, vgf). The thyroidal function related gene dio3b was upregulated by chlorpyrifos and downregulated by higher abamectin concentrations. Important regulatory genes for cardiac muscle (tcap) and forebrain development (npas4a) were the most frequently ifferentially expressed across all insecticide treatments. We consider the identified gene sets as useful early warning biomarker candidates, i.e. for developmental toxicity targeting heart and brain in aquatic vertebrates. Our findings provide a better understanding about early molecular events in response to the analyzed MoA. Perceptively, this promotes the development for sensitive and informative biomarker-based in vitro assays for toxicological MoA prediction and AOP refinement, without the suffering of adult fish. © 2021 The Author(s)","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 17; Correspondence Address: S.

OPs have been shown to have negative human health impacts, particularly developmental neurotoxicity. However, neurotoxic impacts in later adulthood and during the aging process are relatively uncharacterized. The present study examined diazinon (DZN), an OP, to determine the neurobehavioral consequences, in addition to mitochondrial dysfunction on a macroscale (whole organism basal respiration) and on a microscale (whole organ mitochondrial respiration), using zebrafish (ZF) as a model. One group of 14-month-old adult ZF were exposed acutely as adults (0.4, 1.25, and 4.0 μM) for five days and tested as adults, and another group was exposed developmentally 5–120 h post-fertilization (70, 210, and 700 nM) and tested at larval, adolescent, adult, and aging life stages. ZF exposed acutely as adults did not display many significant neurobehavioral impacts or mitochondrial dysfunction. Conversely, the embryonically exposed ZF showed altered behavioral functions at each stage of life which emerged and attenuated as fish transitioned from each developmental stage to the next. Mitochondrial oxygen consumptions measurement results for developmentally DZN exposed ZF showed significant increases in the low and middle dose groups in organs such as the brain and testes.

(Annonaceae) is an edible plant whose fruit is appreciated in the Amazon region of Brazil. The seeds of this plant are rich sources of acetogenins, substances that have antimicrobial, anticancer, repellent, insecticide and larvicidal activities. However, studies on larvicidal evaluation of these substances are almost always limited to the species Aedes aegypti, with few studies with the species Aedes albopictus. In this research, it was investigated the larvicidal effect and mechanisms of action of the ethanolic extract and of the main constituents of Annona mucosa against Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. The compounds were isolated from the ethanolic seed extract by successive silica gel chromatographic columns and characterized by NMR and Infrared spectroscopic analysis, as well as by comparison with literature data, as the acetogenins rolliniastatin 1 and rollinicin. Third- and fourth-instar larvae were submitted to different concentrations of ethanolic extract, rolliniastatin 1 and rollinicin to estimate the LC50 and LC90 after 24 h exposure. The ethanolic extract and rolliniastatin 1 were more active against Ae. albopictus, with LC50 values of 0.55 and 0.20 μg.mL−1, respectively, compared with Ae. aegypti, on which they exhibited values of 2.60 and 0.43 μg.mL−1, respectively. Rollinicin was, on the contrary, more active against Ae. aegypti (LC50 of 0.78 μg.mL−1) than against Ae. albopictus (LC50 of 1.13 μg.mL−1). Significant differences were observed among enzymatic activities of larvae treated with natural products obtained from Annona mucosa and histopathological analysis of the midgut of treated larvae suggested the existence of two action mechanisms. EEAM and main acetogenins, rolliniastatin 1 and rollinicin did not present toxicity against zebrafish.

In this study, common carp were used to assess the individual and combined toxicity of PE-MPs (0, 1.5, or 4.5 mg/L) and GLY (0, 5, or 15 mg/L) on the brain-gut axis. After 60 days of exposure, the developmental toxicity, blood-brain barrier (BBB), locomotor behavior, intestinal barrier (physical barrier, chemical barrier, microbial barrier), and intestinal content metabolism of common carp were evaluated. Results showed that 15 mg/L of GLY exposure significantly reduced the mRNA expression of tight-junction genes (occludin, claudin-2, and ZO-1) in the brain, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was clearly inhibited by high concentrations of GLY. However, different concentrations of PE-MPs had no significant effect on the activity of AChE. Furthermore, the free-swimming behavior of common carp was distinctly inhibited by treatment with a combination of 15 mg/L GLY and 4.5 mg/L PE-MPs. Histological studies indicated that PE-MPs alone and in combination with GLY could disrupt the physical and chemical intestinal barriers of common carp. Additionally, the abundance and diversity of gut microbiota in common carp were significantly changed when exposed to a combination of PE-MPs and GLY. Metabolomics further revealed that PE-MPs combined with GLY triggered metabolic changes and that differential metabolites were related to amino acid and lipid metabolism. These findings illustrate that exposure to PE-MPs or GLY alone is toxic to fish and results in physiological changes to the brain-gut axis.

Development of AM is based on the synthesis of ideas and methods of microbiology, plant physiology, soil science and genetics. This synthesis is aimed to study the organization and evolution of biosystems in which symbiotic microorganisms perform adaptively important functions in cooperation with each other and with host organisms. Upon migration from environment into the endosymbiotic niches of plants and animals, microorganisms form with them multicomponent complexes — holobionts (E. Rosenberg, I. Zilber-Rosenberg, 2018). They possess own systems of heredity, symbiogenomes and hologenomes, which have become the subjects of a new discipline, symbiogenetics (I.A. Tikhonovich, N.A. Provorov, 2012). Microorganisms forming symbioses with plants perform the important adaptive functions — nutritional (N2 fixation, absorption of soil nutrients, firstly phosphates), defensive (biocontrol of pathogens and phytophagans) and regulatory (synthesis of phytohormones that optimize plant development and improve their resistance to adverse environment) (I.A. Tikhonovich, N.A. Provorov, 2009). The broadly studied and practically important plant symbionts include: a) nodule bacteria or rhizobia (Rhizobiales) — N2-fixing symbionts of legumes; b) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycota) — phosphate-mobilizing symbionts of a wide range (more than 80 % species) of plants (A. Berruti et al., 2016); c) rhizospheric and endophytic bacteria (e.g., Azospirillum, Bacillus, Pseudomonas) which stimulate the development of plants and determine their resistance to antagonists (pathogens, pests) and stresses (drought, salinity of soils, their contamination with xenobiotics or heavy metals) (M.A. Hassani et al., 2018). In animals, trophic symbionts determine the assimilation of plant biomass (intestinal or rumen microbiota), synthesis of essential amino acids and cofactors (intestinal and intracellular symbionts), and N2 fixation (symbionts of some herbivorous animals) (E. Rinninella et al., 2019). The study of microbial effects on plants and animals makes it possible to create microbial preparations that improve the nutrition of hosts, their resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and increase the soil fertility. In crop production, preparations of N2-fixing and growth-stimulating bacteria are widely used, which ensure a drastic reduction in application of environmentally hazardous nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers. Preparations of microorganisms that are antagonists of phytopathogens — Pseudomonas, Bacillus (B.J. Lugtenberg et al., 2001; V.K. Chebotar et al., 2009), rodents — Salmonella enteritidis, Serratia plymuthica (A. Soenens, J. Imperial, 2019) or phytophagous insects — Bacillus thuringiensis, Beauveria bassiana (A.V. McGuire, T.D. Northfield, 2020) are used broadly for their biocontrol to significantly reduce the pesticide load on agrocenoses. By studying the integrative functions of agronomically valuable microorganisms, AM invests a significant contribution to the fundamental biological research, including the genetic and molecular interactions of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, evolution of cell and of its genome, and formation of supraorganismal genetic systems (I.A. Tikhonovich, N.A. Provorov, 2012).

Existing concepts to assess chemical hazards to fish, however, do not consider immunotoxicity. Over recent years, the application of in vitro assays for ecotoxicological hazard assessment has gained momentum, what leads to the question whether in vitro assays using piscine immune cells might be suitable to evaluate immunotoxic potentials of environmental chemicals to fish. In vitro systems using primary immune cells or immune cells lines have been established from a wide array of fish species and basically from all immune tissues, and in principal these assays should be able to detect chemical impacts on diverse immune functions. In fact, in vitro assays were found to be a valuable tool in investigating the mechanisms and modes of action through which environmental agents interfere with immune cell functions. However, at the current state of knowledge the usefulness of these assays for immunotoxicity screening in the context of chemical hazard assessment appears questionable. This is mainly due to a lack of assay standardization, and an insufficient knowledge of assay performance with respect to false positive or false negative signals for the different toxicant groups and different immune functions. Also the predictivity of the in vitro immunotoxicity assays for the in vivo immunotoxic response of fishes is uncertain. In conclusion, the currently available database is too limited to support the routine application of piscine in vitro assays as screening tool for assessing immunotoxic potentials of environmental chemicals to fish.

Their enduring existence across vast stretches of land has led them to evolve into unique systems serving a diverse assemblage of organisms and sustaining a staple grain for many people. With food demand rising, agricultural intensification through agrochemical application is a common practice used to boost food production in developing countries, including Sri Lanka. The aim of the present study was to assess the concentration of pesticide residues in water in rice ecosystems and discover their potential impacts on both environmental health and the most common fauna groups across a cropping year in Sri Lanka. A total of 270 water samples from waters associated with paddy fields within a watershed were analyzed for 20 commonly used pesticides; in addition, local farm holders were surveyed to assess pesticide usage details in three selected paddy tracts. We then used the Cornell University environmental impact quotient (EIQ) calculator and the ECOTOX Knowledgebase to determine the exposure risk associated with individual pesticides relative to their application rates and aquatic concentrations. Survey results demonstrate that several pesticides were overapplied at rates 1.2–11 times the recommended application, and the EIQ demonstrated high environmental risk of two of the agrochemicals detected, 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic and diazinon. Fish, amphibians, insects, and beetles were found to have a wide range of potential adverse outcomes from exposure to diazinon, captan, thiamethoxam, and chlorantraniliprole.

Although direct effects of diuron exposure on various organisms have been reported, little is known about its effects on marine fishes including multigenerational effects. Herein, the filial generation (F1) of diuron-exposed marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) (F0) was raised in clean seawater from fertilized eggs to adulthood and used as a marine fish model to study the potential multigenerational effects of diuron. We found that the successful hatching of F1 larvae was significantly reduced and that ovarian development in F1 females was retarded. A significant increase in the percentage of previtellogenic oocytes, along with a visual decrease in the percentage of vitellogenic and mature oocytes in the F1 ovary, were observed. The hormone levels of the hypothalamus–pituitary–gonad–liver axis and vitellogenin-related transcription were downregulated. In addition, the mRNA levels of DNA methyltransferase in the brain, ovary and liver of F1 adult fish exhibited significant upregulation, suggesting that the probable underlying multigenerational mechanism might be associated with epigenetic modifications. Taken together, these results demonstrated that chronic environmental diuron exposure in F0 marine medaka can inhibit F1 ovary development and suggested that diuron may affect marine fish thriving in the ocean. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: Z.

To determine the environmental risk of pesticides, routine ecotoxicological tests are performed on several organisms, including standard fish models. However, these typically do not include fish species from variable habitats and with non-generic life-histories. In particular, inhabitants from temporary ponds such as annual killifish are conventionally understood to be resilient to natural stressors which could translate to higher pesticide resistance or, alternatively, trade-off with their resistance to pesticides and render them more sensitive than classic fish models. Using standard exposure tests, we assessed short-term toxicity effects of two commonly used pesticides, Roundup and cypermethrin, on the annual killifish Nothobranchius neumanni, and compared its sensitivity with that of classic fish models. For Roundup, we found a 72 h-LC50 of 1.79 ± 0.11 mg/L, which is lower than the values reported for zebrafish, medaka, fathead minnow and rainbow trout, suggesting that N. neumanni is more sensitive to the compound. The opposite was true for cypermethrin, with a 72 h-LC50 of 0.27 ± 0.03 mg/L. However, these LC50-values do not deviate strongly from those reported for other fish species, supporting earlier findings in the congeneric N. furzeri that the sensitivity of annual killifish to pollutants is similar to that of classic fish models despite their assumed robustness to environmental stress. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: Y.A.

Methods: A cross-sectional exploratory study was conducted to analyse the patterns of poisoning and the socio-demographic characteristics of the patients. Subgroups were compared using Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact test and further analysed by multivariate logistic regression. Results: 48% of cases were of pharmaceutical drug poisoning. 27.5% of these cases involved polymedication and Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) turned out to be the single most drug used. Suicide was the most common circumstance. 10% of patients had co-diagnoses of psychiatric disorders. Univariate analysis separately showed that females (p < 0.001), higher educated (p = 0.149), higher socioeconomic strata (p = 0.136) and non-addicts (p = 0.002) were more exposed to drugs whereas males, lower educated, lower socioeconomic strata and addicts are skewed to pesticides for poisoning. Most repeat suicide attempts were with the same poisonous agent. 70% of patients with a diagnosed psychiatric disorder have attempted suicide before using some drugs (p < 0.001).

Little is known about how this insecticide affects non-target invertebrate species in aquatic environments. In this study, we explored the effects of aqueous exposures of clothianidin on locomotion, chemosensory-based responses, and agonistic encounters of rusty crayfish (Faxonius rusticus). Clothianidin exposures at a concentration of 1.0 μg/L (i.e., 1.0 ppb) did not alter initiations and retreats, but did increase the amount of time the crayfish interacted per interaction. In a subsequent food cue experiment with crayfish exposed to clothianidin concentrations of 0.4 μg/L and 1.0 μg/L, the test organisms demonstrated chemosensory dysfunction, but no decrease in locomotory movement. As chemosensation is essential for recognizing previous rivals in crayfish, the loss of this sense likely resulted in the exposed crayfish being unable to detect cues used to recognize a previous competitor. An inability to recognize a previous competitor (and who won or lost the previous interaction) could result in crayfish spending more time fighting and less time on foraging and reproduction. This study demonstrates that exposures of crayfish to clothianidin at concentrations found in the environment affects the behavioural ecology of these aquatic invertebrates. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: W.A.

Suppression of an invasive species refers to management of a species such that its effect on other biota in the local ecosystem is acceptable. Eradication is the removal of all individuals of a species from a defined region. We examine the cost and benefit trade-offs between suppression and eradication of Laurentian Great Lakes sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) based on discussions at the 3rd Sea Lamprey International Symposium (held in 2019). Substantial effort has been expended annually since the 1960s to suppress sea lampreys in the Great Lakes basin. Choosing between suppression and eradication is a value judgement, ideally made jointly by scientists, decision-makers, stakeholders, and society. Successful large-scale eradications have been limited to a small number of cases for which the cost to human society justified and supported the long-term commitment necessary for success. The greatest challenge to successful eradication of sea lampreys from the Great Lakes may be a suitable social, political, legal, and institutional environment. Preparations could be made now for a transition in which public pushback on current control methods (pesticide applications and barriers to fish passage) leads to more extensive use of an alternative control method, such as genetic control. © 2021 the United States Geological Survey (USGS)","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: J.V.

Methods: We evaluated 174 individuals, 150 without specific diagnosis and 24 participants with RP. A thermal camera was used to record skin temperature following a cold stress protocol. The hands were then immersed up to the carpal level in a container with cold water. Images were recorded immediately after the emersion and every 5 min, until 20 min post-immersion. For the data analysis, normalized histograms were mapped to define the probability density function of absolute temperature and DDD. The best finger and the best analysis time were defined by the ratio between variance and chi-square, to find the best trade-off between model fitting and data separation into two distinct groups. Results: A hit rate (recall value) of 91.7% for the DDD model and 79.2% for the absolute temperature model were found using DDD ≥ − 1.0 °C for the ring finger and T ≥ 25.5 °C for the index finger. Conclusion: Results show that DDD and absolute temperature models could be suitable as a RP condition exclusion criterion. Moreover, the use of multiple fingers is recommended.

Methods and Results: Among 10 isolates of Colletotrichum species tested, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides PSU-03 was selected as the most aggressive anthracnose pathogenic strain on chili fruit against VOCs produced by Streptomyces species. Among 11 isolates, the strain PSRDC-09 exhibited the highest antifungal activity and was identified as S. salmonis PSRDC-09. The antagonistic mechanism of the VOCs PSRDC-09 on morphological of C. gloeosporioides PSU-03, observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), revealed the irregular distortions in the fungal hyphae. The effect of inoculum size and spore concentration of S. salmonis PSRDC-09 prepared as a wheat seed inoculum on the suppression of C. gloeosporioides PSU-03 was studied both in vitro and on chili fruit. The optimum inoculum size (45 g 0·31 l−1) and spore concentration (107 spores per ml) of the wheat seed culture of S. salmonis PSRDC-09 exhibited the complete suppression (100% inhibition) on C. gloeosporioides PSU-03. The optimum fumigation period of the VOCs PSRDC-09 (45 g 1·38 l−1) was found to be 24 h. Based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, 14 major VOCs (produced by the strain PSRDC-09) were detected and l-linalool was the main volatile component. Conclusions: The results indicated that the VOCs from S. salmonis PSRDC-09 could effectively control the chili anthracnose disease caused by C. gloeosporioides. Significance and Impact of the Study: These findings suggest that S. salmonis PSRDC-09 may have the potential to become a promising biofumigant for biocontrol of chili anthracnose disease in the postharvest system. © 2021 The Society for Applied Microbiology","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: S.

Despite this, no disease-modifying therapy is available. PD is tightly associated with α-synuclein (α-Syn) deposits, which become organised into insoluble, amyloid fibrils. As a typical intrinsically disordered protein, α-Syn adopts a monomeric, random coil conformation in an aqueous solution, while its interaction with lipid membranes drives the transition of the molecule part into an α-helical structure. The central unstructured region of α-Syn is involved in fibril formation by converting to well-defined, β-sheet rich secondary structures. Presently, most therapeutic strategies against PD are focused on designing small molecules, peptides, and peptidomimetics that can directly target α-Syn and its aggregation pathway. Other approaches include gene silencing, cell transplantation, stimulation of intracellular clearance with autophagy promoters, and degradation pathways based on immunotherapy of amyloid fibrils. In the present review, we sum marise the current advances related to α-Syn aggregation/neurotoxicity. These findings present a valuable arsenal for the further development of efficient, nontoxic, and non-invasive therapeutic protocols for disease-modifying therapy that tackles disease onset and progression in the future. © 2022 by the authors.

Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with acute glyphosate herbicide poisoning admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2014 to December 2020. The general information, exposure time, poisoning dose, poisoning cause, poisoning route, clinical manifestations, laboratory examination results during hospitalization, treatment measures, hospital stays and prognosis of the patients were collected. The patients were graded according to the poisoning severity scoring standard of Chinese Expert Consensus on Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute Poisoning in 2016. The highest severity score during hospitalization was used as the final grade. According to the final grade, asymptomatic and mild patients were included in the mild group, and moderate, severe and death patients were included in the severe group. The independent sample T test or Mann-Whitney U test was used for measurement data, and χ2 test or Fisher's exact test was used for counting data. The differences of general data and clinical data between the two groups were compared. Results According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 83 patients with acute glyphosate herbicide poisoning were selected as the study subjects. All patients survived, mainly mild poisoning (56.6%), with a male to female ratio of 33 ∶ 50, and an average age of 39 years. The number of poisoning cases increased yearly (the highest in 2019), and most cases occurred in spring and summer. The main cause of poisoning was suicide (71.1%), direct oral administration (83.1%) was the primary route of poisoning, and the dominating clinical manifestations were digestive symptoms (71.1%). Laboratory tests showed increased white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil percentage (NEUT %) and D-dimer, and decreased hemoglobin and potassium. Compared with the mild group, patients in the severe group were older [(51±17) years vs. (35±19) years], had a higher proportion of suicide and direct oral administration, a longer hospital stay [8.0 (4.8, 12.0) d vs. 3.0 (2.0, 5.5) d], a higher dose of poisoning [200.0 (50.0, 200.0) mL vs. 30.0 (11.3, 57.5) mL], and higher NEUT % within 24 h of admission [(83.4±10.4) vs. (73.2±12.8)]. The increase of WBC, NEUT %, aspartate aminotransferase, prothrombin time, D-dimer and the decrease of serum potassium were more common in the severe group than the mild group, with statistical significance (all P<0.05). Conclusions The number of patients with acute glyphosate herbicide poisoning is increasing yearly. Generally, the condition is mild and the prognosis is satisfying. The severity is more serious in the middle-aged and elderly patients andthose with direct oral administration, high toxic dose, and high NEUT % within 24 h of admission. Severe poisoning is more likely to cause changes in laboratory indicators. © 2022 Chinese Medical Association.

However, the toxic effect of IMI on the freshwater crayfish Procambarus clarkii is unknown. In the current study, the effects of IMI on the locomotion, antioxidative status, digestion and intestinal microbiota of P. clarkii were investigated. The results showed that IMI caused locomotion impairment with reduced crawl velocity, and attenuated their dark preference, aggressiveness and reversal ability. Inhibited AChE in muscle and hepatopancreas indicates the neurotoxicity of IMI which may directly lead their locomotion dysfunction. The increase of antioxidative enzymes activity and MDA level were found after 25 μg/L and 250 μg/L exposure. Significant up-regulation of several antioxidative and immune-related genes, including CZ-SOD, CAT, GPx, GST, AFL, proPO, HSP27 and HSP70 confirmed that oxidative stress was induced in all treatments when exposed to IMI. In addition, there was significant increase of LDH, indicating the different energy allocation during the exposure. Meanwhile, results from DNA damage analysis showed elevated OTM value and 8-OHdG level in hepatopancretic cells. On the other hand, decreases of alpha-amylase, lipase and increase of trypsin in hepatopancreas was observed at 25 and 250 μg/L. In addition, significant changes of composition of intestinal microbiota at both phylum and genus levels were observed according to the 16S rRNA sequencing results. Increase of pathogenic genera and decrease of beneficial bacterial communities revealed the disequilibrium of intestinal flora of crayfish. In summary, results in the present study suggest that IMI at environmentally realistic concentration could induce AChE inhibition and oxidative stress, conjointly leading the locomotion impairment in crayfish.

This study was designed to evaluate malaria preventive measures among patients attending the Bamendjou and Foumbot District hospitals of the West Region of Cameroon. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out within a period of 3 months, from January to March 2020. Data was obtained using a structured questionnaire and laboratory analysis. The CareStart™ Pf Malaria HRP2 qualitative rapid diagnostic test was used for malaria diagnosis. The questionnaire was designed to collect information on respondent’s socio-demographic characteristics, and the use of malaria preventive measures. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, regression analysis, and Chi-square (and Fisher’s exact) test. Results: A total of 170 study participants were recruited in Foumbot and 197 in Bamendjou. Malaria was significantly (P < 0.0001) more prevalent in Foumbot (47.06%) than in Bamendjou (19.8%). In Foumbot, non-use of insect repellent spray (P = 0.0214), insect repellent body cream (P = 0.0009), mosquito spray (P = 0.0001) and not draining stagnant water (P = 0.0004) predisposed to higher risk of malaria. In Bamendjou, non-use of insect repellent spray (P = 0.0012), long-lasting insecticidal bed nets (P = 0.0001), window and door nets (P = 0.0286), predisposed to a higher risk of malaria. Conclusions: Malaria prevalence was high among the study participants especially in Foumbot. An adequate follow-up to ensure effective execution of the recently launched third phase of LLINs distribution campaign in Cameroon is recommended. Additionally, integrated vector management is required to ensure effective control of malaria transmission in Foumbot and Bamendjou. © 2021, The Author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: N.O.

This study characterized the defense abilities of fish by exposed to AZ on challenging with the infection of spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV). The results showed that SVCV replication increased significantly in EPC cells and zebrafish that were exposed to up to 50 μg/L of AZ at 3, 5, 7, and 14 d. Intracellular biochemical assays indicated that AZ at 5 and 50 μg/L inhibited the activation of Nrf2-ARE pathway including a decrease in Nrf2 expression, Nrf2 phosphorylation, HO-1 content, and three antioxidant activities. While no significant difference in ERK1/2 and JNK MAPKs in zebrafish was observed, P38 phosphorylation was significantly decreased at 7 and 14 d, and the changes in MAPKs were more evident in EPC cells previously exposed to AZ at 7 d. These results revealed that AZ initially induced low phosphorylation of MAPKs, triggering the attenuation of Nrf2 phosphorylation to weaken Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus in a longer exposure period (more than 5 d). The data in the cells and fish also showed that antioxidant activities were decreased to some extent at 5–7 d for the cells and 7–14 d for the fish.

Fipronil impairs the regular inhibition of nerve impulses that ultimately result in paralysis and death of insects. Because of its use as a pest control, and due to runoff events, fipronil has been detected in freshwater systems near agricultural areas, and therefore might represent a threat to non-target aquatic organisms. In this study, the toxicity of fipronil to the freshwater midge Chironomus riparius was investigated at biochemical, molecular, and whole organism (e.g. growth, emergence, and behavior) levels.        At the individual level, chronic (28 days) exposure to fipronil resulted in reduced larval growth and emergence with a lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) of 0.081 mu g L-1. Adult weight, which is directly linked to the flying performance and fecundity of midges, was also affected (LOEC = 0.040 mu g L-1). Additionally, behavioral changes such as irregular burrowing behavior of C. riparius larvae (EC50 = 0.084 mu g L-1) and impairment of adult flying performance were observed. At a biochemical level, acute (48 h) exposure to fipronil increased cellular oxygen consumption (as indicated by the increase of electron transport system (ETS) activity) and decreased antioxidant and detoxification defenses (as suggested by the decrease in catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities). Exposure to fipronil also caused alterations in the fatty acid profile of C. riparius, since high levels of stearidonic acid (SDA) were observed. A comparison between exposed and non-exposed larvae also revealed alterations in the expression of globins, cytoskeleton and motor proteins, and proteins involved in protein biosynthesis. These alterations may aid in the interpretation of potential mechanisms of action that lead to the effects observed at the organism level.        Present results show that environmentally relevant concentrations of fipronil are toxic to chironomid populations which call for monitoring of phenylpyrazole insecticides and of their ecological effects in freshwaters. Present results also emphasize the importance of complementing ecotoxicological data with molecular approaches such as proteomics, for a better interpretation of the mode of action of insecticides in aquatic invertebrates.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  20     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  114,10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.105292     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Aquatic insects;Biomarkers;Environmental proteomics;Phenylpyrazole insecticides;Sub-lethal toxicity;MUSSEL MYTILUS-EDULIS;ZEBRAFISH DANIO-RERIO;OXIDATIVE STRESS;QUANTITATIVE PROTEOMICS;DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER;ENVIRONMENTAL FATE;SEDIMENT TOXICITY;LIFE-HISTORY;MG.

This study was aimed to investigate the impact of commonly used pesticides (deltamethrin) on the blood and tissue oxidative stress level in catfish (Clarias gariepinus); in addition to the protective effect of alpha-tocopherol on deltamethrin induced oxidative stress.        Catfish were divided into three groups, 1st control group include 20 fish divided into two tanks each one contain 10 fish, 2nd deltamethrin group, where Fish exposed to deltamethrin in a concentration (0.75 mu g/l) and 3rd Vitamin E group, Fish exposed to deltamethrin and vitamin E at a dose of 12 mu g/l for successive 4 days.        Serum, liver, kidney and Gills were collected for biochemical assays. Tissue oxidative stress biomarkers malondialdhyde (MDA) and catalase activity in liver, kidney and gills tissues, serum liver enzymes (ALT and AST), serum albumin, total protein, urea and creatinine were analysed.        Results: Our results showed that 48 h. exposure to 0.75 mu g/l deltamethrin significantly (p < 0.05) increased lipid peroxidation (MDA) in the liver, kidney and gills while catalase activity was significantly decreased in the same tissues. This accompanied by significant increase in serum ALT, AST activity, urea and creatinine and a marked decrease in serum albumin and total proteins.        Conclusions: It could be concluded that deltamethrin is highly toxic to catfish even in very low concentration (0.75 mu g/l). Moreover the effect of deltamethrin was pronounced in the liver of catfish in comparison with kidneys and gills. Moreover fish antioxidants and oxidative stress could be used as biomarkers for aquatic pollution, thus helping in the diagnosis of pollution.

Simultaneously fish kept in dechlorinated water for 24 h were subjected to air exposure and a non-stress group was not subjected to air stress or any contaminants. Animals were sampled immediately (t0) and after 1, 3 and 6 h of air exposure (t1, t3 and t6 respectively) for the analysis of plasma cortisol, glucose and Na+, hepatic glycogen, branchial Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), number of red blood cells per cubic millimeter of blood (RBC), hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin content (Hb). In fish pre-exposed to copper the stress response was inhibited, and at t1 and t3 both cortisol and glucose remained significantly lower compared to fish subjected to air stress only. in fish pre-exposed to atrazine there was no rise in cortisol, but there was an increase in plasma glucose, RBC, Hct and Hb at t0 and a return of these parameters to basal levels at t1, as they did not differ significantly in relation to non-stressed fish. Animals pre-exposed to either Cu or atrazine showed a significant reduction in NKA activity at t1 and t3, in relation to air stressed fish.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of diazinon exposure on fish and to investigate the potential of the HSP inducer (HSPi) in developing a defense mechanism. To achieve this, several factors were analyzed, including the HSP70 gene expression, levels of immunity markers (lysozyme, IgM, and C3), antioxidant status, and the activity of acetylcholine esterase (AChE). Stellate sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus) fry, was exposed to diazinon (25, 50, and 75% of 96h-LC50) for 6 days after pre-treatment with an HSP inducer (HSPi), TEX-OE (R) (a prickly pear cactus extract), for 4 hours. Two HSPi concentrations, 100 and 200 mg.L-1, were used. Pre-treatment with HSPi significantly enhanced HSP70 gene expression in the gill and liver, as well as immune markers in the blood of Acipenser stellatus. Diazinon-treated groups exhibited higher antioxidant activities of SOD, CAT, and T-AOC. Increased activity also observed in control fish pre-treated with HSPi. However, stellate sturgeon receiving both diazinon and HSPi+diazinon experienced a significant decrease in AChE activity in comparison with control group. Cortisol levels were elevated in the fish that were subjected to diazinon. Those subjected to diazinon after receiving HSPi showed a significant decrease in cortisol levels. In conclusion, the study suggests that HSPi-mediated HSP70 induction may have a protective effect.

They frequently target sperm to increase their transmission success, but these manipulations are often associated with reduced male fertility. Low fertility of SGE-carrying males is suggested to promote polyandry as a female strategy to bias paternity against male carriers. Support for this hypothesis is found in several taxa, where SGE-carrying males have reduced sperm competitive ability. In contrast, when SGEs give rise to reproductive incompatibilities between SGE-carrying males and females, polyandry is not necessarily favoured, irrespective of the detrimental impact on male fertility. This is due to the frequency-dependent nature of these incompatibilities, because they will decrease in the population as the frequency of SGEs increases. However, reduced fertility of SGE-carrying males can prevent the successful population invasion of SGEs. In addition, SGEs can directly influence male and female mating behaviour, mating rates and reproductive traits (e. g. female reproductive tract length and male sperm). This reveals a potent and dynamic interaction between SGEs and polyandry highlighting the potential to generate sexual selection and conflict, but also indicates that polyandry can promote harmony within the genome by undermining the spread of SGEs.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  39     Total Times Cited:  42     Cited Reference Count:  102,10.1098/rstb.2012.0049     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),sperm competition;sexual conflict;Wolbachia;sex-ratio distorter;STALK-EYED FLIES;SPERM COMPETITIVE ABILITY;SEX-RATIO DISTORTER;WOLBACHIA INFECTION;DDT RESISTANCE;MATING PREFERENCES;MATE CHOICE;DROSOPHILA;SELECTION;EVOLUTION,NA,NA,the dynamic relationship between polyandry and selfish genetic elements

Results. There were no statistically significant differences following the analysis of their social interaction and locomotor tests (p>0.05). However, several exceptions have been noted in the control, rotenone, and probiotics groups when we compared their locomotor activity during the pretreatment and treatment interval (p<0.05). We further assessed the role of rotenone in disturbing the detoxifying system as represented by three enzymes known as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Despite the fact that there were no statistically significant changes within SOD and GPx levels between the control group and rotenone, probiotics, and rotenone+probiotics (p>0.05), relevant changes have been observed between the analyzed groups (p<0.05 and p<0.005, respectively). On the other hand, significant differences (p<0.05) have been observed for MDA when we analyzed the data between the control group and the other three groups. Conclusions. Our results suggest that rotenone can be successfully used to trigger Parkinson's disease-related symptomatology in zebrafish.</p>",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  71,10.1155/2021/9629102     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ADULT ZEBRAFISH;NONMOTOR SYMPTOMS;DOPAMINE LEVELS;TERM EXPOSURE;BEHAVIOR;ANXIETY;DAMAGE;MOTOR;Parkinson Disease;Oxidative Stress;Motor Activity,NA,NA,the possible role of <i>bifidobacterium longum<i> bb536 and <i>lactobacillus rhamnosus<i> hn001 on locomotor activity and oxidative stress in a rotenoneinduced zebrafish model of parkinsons disease

Methods This review presents qualitative and quantitative evidence in three animal models (rodent, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans), for neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects occurring at CPF doses lower than those inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE).        Results CPF treatment in rodents at low noncholinergic doses during neurodevelopment showed behavioral effects, including locomotor activity, neuromotor function (NMF), cognition, anxiety, social behavior, and maternal care. Zebrafish and C. elegans, which are transparent during development, allow for detailed analysis of specific systems; further, they exhibit neurotoxic effects closely emulating those observed in mammalian pathways. Qualitative results showed concordance among rodents, zebrafish and C. elegans for adverse effects on locomotor activity, NMF, and AChE inhibition. Male rodents had greater sensitivity for effects on locomotor activity than females and exposure during the gestation day 10-14 window showed consistent increases in locomotor activity at low CPF doses (<= 1.0 mg kg(-1) day(-1)). Zebrafish had cognitive and anxiety deficits after CPF treatment at low doses and young adult C. elegans had reproductive dysfunction associated NMF and disruption of the serotonergic pathway. Quantitative data for all three species showed neurobehavioral effects after exposure to CPF doses approximately 2-10-fold below the threshold for AChE inhibition.        Conclusions Taken together, these findings provided a weight-of-evidence for low-dose CPF neurotoxicity and noncholinergic mechanisms. Variability in laboratories, exposure methods, tests, sex, and animal species/strain might have contributed to the inconsistent results. The detrimental CPF effects during early development are relevant to human populations.

In this system, the degradation of organic pollutants occurs by attack of hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) which are produced from the reaction of added ferrous catalyst (Fe2+) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrogene rated by oxygen reduction at carbon felt cathode. The degradative efficiency of EF system was comparatively studied versus anodic oxidation method (AO) in absence and presence of H2O2, It was found that only EF is sufficiently powerful to induce fast and efficient mineralization of rotenone and its degradation intermediates.        The mineralization of rotenone was found to depend largely on organic solvent type, metal ion catalyst, applied current and initial rotenone concentration. The best operative conditions are achieved using aqueous-acetonitrile mixture of pH 3.0 in the presence of 0.2 mM Fe2+ catalyst with a current intensity of 100 mA. Under these optimized conditions, 30 min were sufficient to completely degrade rotenone in 100 mL of a 20 mg L-1 solution. A nearly complete mineralization (similar to 96% of COD removal) was achieved after 8 h treatment.        Rotenone removal kinetic was found to obey the pseudo-first order model and the absolute second order rate constant (k(Rot) = 2.49 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1)) for the reaction between the substrate and (OH)-O-center dot was derived.        HPLC-MS and HPLC-DAD analysis were applied to identify and follow the evolution of rotenone oxidation products. Three stable aromatic intermediates were observed and two of these were identified as 12a beta-hydroxyrotenone and hydroquinone. Subsequent attack of these intermediates by (OH)-O-center dot radicals leads to the formation of aliphatic carboxylic acids such as succinic, acetic, oxalic and formic, quantified by ion-exclusion chromatography.

Although the concentrations in the environment and biota have continuously decreased, dioxins still pose a risk to human health. The risk and its formation vary in different parts of the Baltic Sea, due to variability in the environmental and societal factors affecting it. This paper presents a systematic literature review and knowledge synthesis about the regional dioxin risk formation in four sub-areas of the Baltic Sea and evaluates, whether systemic approach changes our thinking about the risk and its effective management. We studied the dioxin flux from atmospheric deposition to the Baltic Sea food webs, accumulation to two commercially and culturally important fish species, Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras) and Baltic salmon (Salmo salar), and further to risk group members of four Baltic countries. Based on 46 studies, we identified 20 quantifiable variables and indexed them for commensurable regional comparison. Spatial differences in dioxin pollution, environmental conditions, food web dynamics, and the following dioxin concentrations in herring and salmon, together with fishing and fish consumption, affect how the final health risk builds up. In the southern Baltic Sea, atmospheric pollution levels are relatively high and environmental processes to decrease bioavailability of dioxins unfavorable, but the growth is fast, which curb the bioaccumulation of dioxins in the biota. In the North, long-range atmospheric pollution is minor compared to South, but the local pollution and slower growth leads to higher bioaccumulation rates. However, based on our results, the most remarkable differences in the dioxin risk formation between the areas arise from the social sphere: the emissions, origin of national catches, and cultural differences in fish consumption. The article suggests that acknowledging spatial characteristics of socio-ecological systems that generate environmental risks may aid to direct local focus in risk management. (C) 2020 The Authors.

GPx activity was found to be significantly induced 12 h after the exposure to 2.5 mg/L of glyphosate as compared with the control group. A similar degree of induction was also observed for CAT activity but not for SOD. For long term exposure, except for the GPx activity after exposure to 5 mg/L of glyphosate, the activities of all other enzymes remained on a par with the control group. It was also observed that the levels of gene expression of these enzymes were not comparable with each other. It is assumed that these differences might result from the effect of glyphosate before translation and the possible reasons for this scenario are also discussed. The results of swimming performance are found to be consistent with responses of the antioxidant system, and they are attributed to the energy metabolism.

M. cuchia is a tasteful, medicinally valuable, nutritionally rich, and economically important fish with high demands in national as well as international markets. The eel is recommended for consumption due to its high protein content and calorific values besides its high erythrocyte indices. The fish is usually available in freshwater ecosystems and shows survivability in extreme environmental conditions like high temperatures, low oxygen levels, high salt conditions, shallow waters, etc. by showing various morpho-histochemical, respiratory, and epidermal adaptations. It plays an important role in the socioeconomic development of a nation by providing employment and means of livelihood to millions of people involved in its production, catching, and marketing. The population of the eel is declining at a faster rate due to aggressive catching and less rearing, habitat destruction, and lack of conservative measures, therefore, requires serious attention in terms of production and conservation.

The primary metabolite of chlorpyrifos is 3,5,6-trichloro pyridine-2-phenol (TCP). Because of its strong water solubility and mobility, this harmful metabolite exists in the environment in a large amount. Although TCP has potentially harmful effects on organisms in the environment, few studies have addressed TCP pollution. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the effect of chlorpyrifos and TCP on the microsomal cytochrome P450 content in the liver, on the activity of NADPH-P450 reductase and antioxidative enzymes [catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)], and on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage in zebrafish. Male and female zebrafish were separated and exposed to a control solution and three concentrations of chlorpyrifos (0.01, 0.1, 1 mg L-1) and TCP (0.01, 0.1, 0.5 mg L-1), respectively, sampled after 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 days. The results indicated that the P450 content and the NADPH-P450 reductase and antioxidative enzyme (CAT and SOD) activities could be induced by chlorpyrifos and TCP.

This study assessed the effects of long-term exposure to PCZ on the antioxidant defense system and Na+-K+-ATPase activity of rainbow trout brain. Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of PCZ (0.2, 50, and 500 mu g/l) for 7, 20, and 30 days, respectively. Oxidative stress indices (reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and carbonyl protein) and antioxidant parameters (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and reduced glutathione) were measured, as well as Na+-K+-ATPase activity. Adaptive responses to PCZ-induced stress were observed at 7 days. With prolonged exposure, significantly higher levels of oxidative indices were indicative of oxidative stress, as also were the significant inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activity and reduced glutathione content. Na+-K+-ATPase activity was significantly inhibited after prolonged exposure. Chemometrics of all parameters by principal component analysis, enabled the separation of sampled individuals into four groups with 93.39% of total accumulated variance. A low level of oxidative stress can induce the adaptive responses of the antioxidant defense system, while prolonged exposure to PCZ may lead to serious oxidative damage in fish brain. We suggest that selected biochemical markers in fish brain could be used as potential biomarkers for monitoring residual fungicides present in the aquatic environments.

We previously demonstrated that miR-155 was significantly downregulated in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in response to fipronil (5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl) sulphinyl]1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile) exposure. However, the regulation of this miRNA's predicted target gene cyb561d2, which is a member of the cytochrome b561 (cyt b561) family involved in electron transfer, cell defence, and chemical stress, has not been experimentally validated to date. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fipronil on miR-155 and cyb561d2 in zebrafish. The expression of miR-155 was downregulated, whereas cyb561d2 was upregulated in both mRNA and protein level in a dose-dependent manner upon stimulation of fipronil. The dual luciferase report assay demonstrated that miR-155 interacted with cyb561d2 30-untranslated regions (3'-UTR). The expression of cyb561d2 was reduced in both mRNA and protein levels when ZF4 cells were transfected with an miR-155 mimic, whereas its expression levels of both mRNA and protein were increased when endogenous miR-155 was inhibited by transfection with an miR-155 inhibitor. The results improved our understanding of molecular mechanism of toxicity upon fipronil exposure, and presents miR-155 as a potential novel toxicological biomarker for chemical exposure.

The 96-h LC50 values for ENDO and PHE were 4.6 mu g L-1 and 920 mu g L-1, respectively. To evaluate the mixture toxicity, LC10 and LC50 concentrations were grouped into four combinations as ENDO-LC10 + PHE-LC10, ENDO-LC10 + PHE-LC50, ENDO-LC50 + PHE-LC10, and ENDO-LC50 + PHE-LC50, and their acute toxicities were determined. The combination of LC50-ENDO and LC10-PHE exhibited a synergistic effect. In addition, acetylcholinesterase activity decreased in zebrafish bodies exposed to ENDO with or without PHE. Combined treatments induced higher glutathione S-transferase activity compared to individual treatments. Carboxylesterase activity increased in both heads and bodies of ENDO-treated fishes compared with PHE-treated fishes. Using RT-qPCR technique, CYP1A gene expression significantly up-regulated in all combinations, whereas CYP3A was unchanged, suggesting that enzymes involved in defense may play different roles in the detoxification. CYP7A1 gene responsible for bile acid biosynthesis is dramatically down-regulated after exposure to the synergistic combination exposure, referring that the synergistic effect may be resulted from the reduction of bile production in zebrafishes. Among gender-related genes, CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 genes in female zebrafish decreased after treatment with ENDO alone and combination of LC50-ENDO and LC10-PHE. This might be related to a reduction in cortisol production. The overall results indicated that ENDO and PHE were toxic to zebrafish adults both individually and in combination, and that their co-presence induced changes in the expression of genes responsible for metabolic processes and defense mechanisms.

Significant shifts were observed in zooplankton and phytoplankton composition following removal of brown trout from the reservoir. Shifts in zooplankton community composition did not occur immediately following trout removal (February), but instead followed the likely timing of galaxiid spawning (July). The removal of brown trout likely resulted in reduced predation pressure on galaxiids. A major change occurred in the zooplankton community with the dominance shifting from larger crustaceans to smaller rotifers, indicating an increased predation pressure from the larval native galaxiid. A delayed response in zooplankton community composition change indicates rotenone was not the direct cause of this.

This is expected to be the case for density-dependent effects (DDE), which influence the population dynamics of many organisms. Our goal was to evaluate stage-specific DDE on the growth, movement, and survival of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar from the individual to the group level over varying spatial scales (20 160 m). We used passive integrated transponder tags and associated technology to assess individual growth, survival, and movement histories in a single stream in Maine undergoing restoration efforts via stocking of fry. We studied six life stages over 18 months for four cohorts of presmolt Atlantic salmon. Our findings show that the DDE on growth can be detected at multiple stages well past the young-of-the-year stage in juvenile salmon. We saw a clear development of decreasing DDE on size and growth as cohorts aged. This trend appears to coincide with a tendency for mean fish size to become more variable in low-density reaches. Density had limited effects on individual movements and mortality during most of juvenile rearing, with such effects largely being confined to the period from spring through fall of the age-1 year. Shifting the focus of analysis from individuals to group means spanning larger spatial scales had pronounced effects on both the detection of DDE, the magnitude of apparent density effects, and the amount of variation in fish size explained by density.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  35,10.1577/T09-121.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),LIFE-HISTORY VARIATION;SALAR L;POPULATION-DENSITY;SOCIAL-DOMINANCE;STREAM SALMONIDS;BROWN TROUT;BODY-SIZE;GROWTH;SURVIVAL;COMPETITION;Seasons,NA,NA,seasonal density dependence in atlantic salmon over varying spatial scales

The present study therefore aimed at detecting the biochemical changes caused by diazinon. To accomplish this aim, we studied the effects of sublethal concentrations (0.0036, 0.018, and 0.036 ppb) of diazinon on acetylcholine esterase activity, antioxidant enzyme activities, and lipid peroxidation in the liver of Cyprinus carpio on days 5, 15, and 30 after the exposure. The results revealed that the antioxidant enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase were induced by diazinon exposure. In addition, the highest catalytic activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) was obtained with 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). GST activity toward 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB) was also observed in the liver, yet it was relatively low as opposed to the other substrates tested. On the other hand, hepatic malondialdehyde level did not show any significant alteration except after the exposure on day 15. The exposure of low concentrations of diazinon to C. carpio can induce oxidative stress in liver; yet restoring susceptibility and adapting to oxidative stress are likely to occur when low level of oxidative stress is administered. Furthermore, no significant change was observed in hepatic lipid peroxidation after diazinon treatment indicating that liver tissue resisted to oxidative stress by enhancing their antioxidant mechanisms. The level of lipid peroxidation was assumed to be associated with the concentrations of diazinon and experimentation periods. The induction of glutathione S-transferase and antioxidant enzyme activities were also assumed to have resulted from the defense against the toxicity of diazinon. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The co-existence of inducers and inhibitors of cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases (CYP1A) is typical of complex environmental mixtures and requires modifications of the in vivo EROD assay: For this end, zebrafish embryos were used to evaluate the EROD-modifying potentials of common single-compound exposures as well as binary mixtures with the PAH-type Ah-receptor agonist beta-naphthoflavone. For chemical testing, chlorpyrifos and Aroclor 1254 were selected; beta-naphthoflavone served as maximum EROD induction control. Chlorpyrifos (<= EC10) could be documented to be a strong CYP1A inhibitor causing characteristic edema-related toxicity. Aroclor 1254 resulted in inhibition of CYP1A catalytic activity in a concentration-and specific time-dependent manner. Next to a fast CYP1A induction, CYP1A inhibition could also be detected after 3 h short-term exposure of zebrafish embryos to chlorpyrifos. This communication also describes techniques for the quantification of fluorescence signals via densitometry as a basis for subsequent statistical assessment. The co-exposure approach with zebrafish embryos accounts for the nature of potential interaction between CYP1A inducers and inhibitors and thus pays tribute to the complexity of environmental mixtures. The co-exposure EROD live-imaging assay thus facilitates a better understanding of mixture effects and allows a better assessment and interpretation of (embryo) toxic potentials.

Therefore, parameters of liver antioxidant status, energy metabolism and neurotransmission were determined in different tissues of the common prawn and used to assess the effects at sub-individual level, whereas swimming velocity was used to assess the effects at the individual level. It was also investigated if the swimming velocity can be used as an endpoint in ecotoxicology bioassays and if it can be as sensitive as biomarker endpoints.        Swimming velocity was significantly reduced in prawns exposed to deltamethrin, showing a lowest observed effect (LOEC) of 0.6 ng L-1. Eye acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was significantly increased in prawns exposed to 0.6, 1.2 and 2.4 ng L-1 deltamethrin, whereas muscle cholinesterase (ChE) activity was significantly increased in prawns exposed to 19 and 39 ng L-1. On the other hand, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was significantly increased in muscle of prawns exposed to 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 4.9 ng L-1 deltamethrin, showing that organisms were requiring additional energy, but probably using it for detoxification processes rather than locomotion, since swimming velocity was inhibited. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity was significantly increased in the digestive gland of common prawn exposed to 19 and 39 ng L-1 deltamethrin. Catalase (CAT) activity was significantly increased in digestive gland of prawn exposed to 19 ng L-1 deltamethrin. However, CAT activity decreased in digestive gland of prawn exposed to 39 ng L-1, suggesting an antioxidant defense system failure concomitant with high levels of lipid peroxidation. Thus, global results showed that decreased swimming velocity was not associated with cholinesterase inhibition. In fact, the impairment of swimming velocity may be due to allocation of energy for detoxification and antioxidant protection instead of swimming activity. The present study showed that swimming velocity could be used as an ecologically relevant tool and a sensitive endpoint to assess and complement the study of pesticide effects on marine organisms.

We also tested these products in combination. We analyzed the defensive capacity of the cells by measuring the activity of xenobiotic extruder proteins, as well as the expression of these same proteins. Cytotoxic effects of both pesticides were observed individually, as well as with the mixture of both products; including an inhibitory effect on the activity of xenobiotic extrusion. When exposed to the insecticide Furadan, and also the mixture of Furadan and Roundup, there was an increase in the expression of P glycoproteins (P-gps). There was also a negative correlation with cytotoxicity, mainly exhibited by mitochondrial activity and lysosomal integrity, but also with respect to the activity of P-gps. We observed that concentrations below those allowed by law were toxic regarding all parameters tested in this study, with the exception of mitochondrial function.

The control fish from site B was distinguished by weakness of antioxidant defence (measured from superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, redox index of glutathione (GSH), superoxide anion (O-2 center dot) and lipid peroxidation levels), imbalance of the concentrations of protein metallothionein (MT-SH) and MT-related metals (MT-Me) and neurotoxicity. Differences in glutathione-S-transferase activity in the liver and vitellogenin-like proteins in the serum were also showed between B and Z control groups. Common effects of pesticides were related to a decrease in GSH, an increase in O-2 center dot production, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity and hepatosomatic index. Apollo provoked particular elevation of MT-SH/MT-Me ratio. Population-related difference in the response was the activation of antioxidant defence in fish from site B and its inhibition in fish from site Z.

During the acute toxicity test, fish mortality progressively increased with RT concentration along with behavioral abnormalities were detected. The calculated 96 h-LC50 value of RT was found as 1.21 mg/L. Fish exposed to 0.5 mg/L of RT (40% of 96 h-LC50) showed a significant increase in the hepatic somatic index (HSI) with a concomitant decrease in Fulton's condition factor (K). The sublethal exposure also induced significant increases (p < 0.05) in the hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, reduced glutathionc (GSH) content, and catalase (CAT) activity, with a concomitant decrease in the glutathionc S-tran.sferase (GST) activity. In the gills, RT exposure induced significant increases in the GST activity, GSH and LPO levels, whereas CAT activity was inhibited. RT also induced CAT and GST activities together with the content of GSH and LPO levels in the white muscle. On the other hand, significant decreases in the CAT and GST activities were detected in the heart with a marked increase in the GSH content and no changes in LPO levels.

REEs are therefore becoming emerging pollutants and it is important to understand their implications for ecosystem health. However, little knowledge of REE bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms is available and especially on their internal distribution in fish. In the present study, REE organotropism was determined in Anguilla anguilla from the Loire estuary (France) by determining burdens in a wide set of tissues, organs and biological fluids. Differences have been observed between life stages and genders. For yellow eels, the most accumulating organ was the gills (126.90 +/- 50.78 mu g/kg dw) and for silver eels, it was the liver (181.78 +/- 62.04 mu g/kg dw for males; 203.79 +/- 111.86 mu g/kg dw for females). The comparison between female silver and yellow eels shown that female silver individuals accumulated significantly more REEs in the urinary system (US), muscles, gonads, spleen and liver, while yellow individuals accumulated more in gills. The comparison between male and female silver eels also highlighted differences, indeed the females accumulated significantly more REEs in the US, gonads, skin and spleen, compared to males which accumulated significantly more in muscles and gills. REEs abundances arc also different between organs, life stages and genders. The gonads of female silver eels exhibited a particular profile with the dominance of gadolinium (Gd) (up to 74.2% of Sigma REEs). Moreover, the presence of Anguillicola crassus in the swim bladder of organisms seemed to have an impact on REE bioaccumulation: parasitized yellow eels present higher concentrations of REEs in muscles, gills, gonads and liver than non-parasitized individuals. Regarding glass eels, REE contribution profiles in the whole body were close to those of yellow and silver eel skin. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Actinovate was the only product able to reduce disease severity by about 50% and improve plant growth of the susceptible hosts. Its effectiveness differed by isolate. Several other biofungicides and the standard fungicide provided suppression of disease and improved plant growth but their effectiveness was dependent on host species, product and isolate. None of the products prevented disease and generally the level of control obtained was lower than would be acceptable for a commercial nursery.

For each grass species, the experimental design used was completely randomized, in a factorial scheme 6 x 2, with four replications, using two growth regulators (trinexapac-ethyl and ethephon), three herbicides applied in sub doses (clethodim, imazethapyr and metsulfuron-methyl), and a check without application. All treatments were evaluated under two light conditions, represented by plastic greenhouse (total light) and plastic greenhouse + shading 50% (partial light). The results obtained at 63 days after application showed that trinexapac-ethyl (250 g ha(-1)), clethodim (12 g ha(-1)) and imazethapyr (12 g ha(-1)) were the best growth regulators for the vegetative development of C. dactylon (65.8, 29.6 and 18.7%), Z. japonica (66.2, 40.7 and 49.7%) and A. compressus (56.5, 10.3 and 17.2%) grasses and for inflorescence emission of C. dactylon (100.0, 95.9 and 89.6%), under high and low luminosity.

Although crop pests and their natural enemies may be diversely affected by measures derived from these principles, those generally result in increased agroecosystem resilience vis-a-vis both aerial and soil pests. Earlier studies by ICRISAT and CIRAD and their partners in West Africa showed the potential of the implementation of these principles for the management of some major pests of both staple food and horticultural crops, and their limitations for others, notably in the water-saving and income-generating systems mixing cereals, legumes, and high-value crops currently promoted in the Sudano-Sahelian zones, such as the drip irrigation-based African Market Garden (AMG) and the water harvesting-based Bio-Reclamation of Degraded Lands (BDL) systems. Pigeon-pea showed potential for trap-cropping tomato fruit worm (TFW) on okra, while Andropogon grass was dismissed for such management of stem-borer on pearl millet, and mixed results were obtained with castor bean and other potential trap crops for panicle-feeding bug management on sorghum. The results presented highlight the potential for mobilizing either aerial or soil-bound biological processes for managing fruit flies (FF), the main pest of grafted jujube tree, and leaf worm, the main pest of the Moringa tree, for sustainable production of these two major crops (in BDL and AMG systems, respectively), without having to rely on synthetic pesticide sprays. Studies on the social acceptability of the proposed management options (e. g., pigeon-pea in okra-based BDL) are also underway. The potential of the Jatropha shrub grown as a live-fence around these systems, either for its top-down effects or via the use of its extracts in an assisted push-pull strategy, is discussed.

People living close to nature often observe the circumstances around them and are the often the first to identify and adapt to any changes. The appearance of certain birds, mating of certain animals and flowering of certain plants are all seen as important signals of change with respect to timing and seasonality of natural phenomena that are well understood in traditional knowledge systems. Indigenous and local peoples have relied on biodiversity as a buffer against environmental variation, change and catastrophe. In the face of plague, if one crop fails, another will survive. In coping with risks associated with excessive rainfall, drought or crop failure, some traditional people grow a wide diversity of crop species and varieties with differential susceptibility to drought and floods and supplement their crops by hunting, fishing and collecting wild food plants. The diversity of crops and food resources is often matched by a similar diversity in the locating of fields - a safety measure to increase the likelihood that in the face of extreme weather at least some of the fields will be able to produce harvestable crops. Indigenous Technical Knowledge has three main aspects - materials, operations or practices, and institutional systems responsible for the implementation of the knowledge. The materials which are connected with the Indigenous Knowledge are the traditional seeds, medicines and pesticides collected from the plants and animals, the tools used in livelihood such as gears and crafts in fishing.

The objective of this study was to investigate how VIN affects mate calling behavior of South African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis) and whether it is effective at environmentally relevant concentrations. Male X. laevis were injected with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to stimulate their androgen-controlled mate calling behavior and were treated with VIN at concentrations of 10(-6), 10(-8) and 10(-10) M. VIN at 10(-6) M reduced calling activity. Furthermore, the vocalization composition of VIN-treated X. laevis was altered. The call types advertisement calls and chirping are uttered by reproductively active males, whereas the call types growling, ticking, and rasping indicate a sexually unaroused state of a male. VIN at any of the tested concentrations led to a decrease in utterance of calls, which indicate a sexually aroused state of the males, and an increase in relative proportions of calls, indicating a sexually unaroused state of the males. Additionally, the mean duration of clicks and the number of accentuated clicks during the advertisement calls decreased at all concentrations of VIN. No significant differences were observed in any other temporal or spectral calling parameters between the treatments. This study illustrates that exposure to the antiandrogen VIN might result in a reduced reproductive success by altering mate calling behavior of X. laevis. Moreover, it suggests that the behavioral parameters examined in this study can be used as sensitive biomarkers for detecting antiandrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds in amphibians.

The scopes of the 3 renewal applications cover the continued marketing of:        - existing food and food ingredients produced from maize MON810 (Reference EFSAGMO- RX-MON810[(8-1a)]) that have been placed on the market in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 258/97;        - feed consisting of and/or containing maize MON810 that were authorised under Directive 90/220/EEC (Commission Decision 98/294/EC), including the use of seed for cultivation (Reference EFSA-GMO-RX-MON810([20-1a]));        - food additives produced from maize MON810 that were authorised under Directive 89/107/EEC, and feed produced from maize MON810, i.e., feed additives lawfully placed on the market under Directive 70/524/EEC and feed materials (Reference EFSA-GMO-RX-MON810([8-lb/20-lb])).        After the date of entry into force of the Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, the products mentioned above were notified to the European Commission according to Articles 8 or 20 of this Regulation and subsequently included in the Community Register of GM food and feed.        Maize MON810 expresses a CrylAb insecticidal protein, derived from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki, which confers protection against lepidopteran target pests such as the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) and species belonging to the genus Sesamia.        In delivering its scientific opinion, the EFSA GMO Panel considered the 3 renewal applications (EFSA-GMO-RX-MON810[8.1. a], EFSA-GMO-RX-MON810[20.1. a] and EFSAGMO- RX-MON81018.1.b/20.1.b]); additional information supplied by the applicant; the scientific comments submitted by Member States; the report of the Spanish Competent Authority and its Biosafety Commission; and relevant information published in the scientific literature.        The EFSA GMO Panel assessed maize MON810 with reference to the intended uses and appropriate principles described in the guidance document of the EFSA GMO Panel for the risk assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed. The scientific assessment included molecular characterisation of the inserted DNA and expression of target proteins. A comparative analysis of agronomic traits and composition was undertaken, and the safety of the new protein and the whole food/feed were evaluated with respect to potential toxicity, allergenicity and nutritional quality. An assessment of environmental impacts and the post-market environmental monitoring plan were undertaken.        Maize MON810 was generated by particle acceleration technology. Maize MON810 expresses a crylAb coding sequence that encodes an insecticidally active CrylAb protein. The molecular characterisation data established that a single insert is integrated in the maize genomic DNA. Appropriate analyses of the integration site including sequence determination of the inserted DNA and flanking regions and bioinformatic analysis have been performed. Updated bioinformatic analysis of junction regions demonstrated the absence of any potential new open reading frames coding for proteins known to be toxic for humans and other mammals and/or allergens. The expression of the genes introduced by genetic modification has been sufficiently analysed and the stability of the genetic modification has been demonstrated over several generations. The EFSA GMO Panel is of the opinion that the molecular characterisation of the DNA insert and flanking regions of maize MON810 does not raise any safety concern, and that sufficient evidence for the stability of the genetic modification was provided.        Analyses carried out on materials from maize MON810, including stacked GM maize events where maize MON810 was one of the parental lines, and their comparators indicate that maize MON810 is compositionally, phenotypically and agronomically equivalent to the non-GM counterparts and conventional maize, except for the newly expressed trait.        The CrylAb protein shows no homology with proteins known to be toxic for humans and other mammals and/or allergens. In addition, this protein is rapidly degraded under simulated gastric conditions. Furthermore, the CrylAb protein has been extensively assessed in previous opinions of the EFSA GMO Panel. No concerns for humans and animals were identified regarding the safety of the CrylAb protein.        In a 90-day feeding study in rats, no indications of adverse effects were observed. In addition, a 42-day broiler feeding study provided evidence of nutritional equivalence of maize MON810 kernels to kernels of conventional maize. The toxicological and nutritional data on maize MON810 and appropriate non-GM maize control published during the last 10 years confirm that these maize varieties have comparable influence on the test systems. Therefore, the EFSA GMO Panel is of the opinion that maize MON810 is as safe as its non-GM counterparts and that the overall allergenicity of the whole plant is not changed through the genetic modification.        The Spanish Competent Authority and its Biosafety Commission provided to EFSA its report on the environmental risk assessment in line with Articles 6.3(e) and 18.3(e) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. The Spanish Competent Authority and its Biosafety Commission conclude that ""according to the current state of scientific knowledge and after examining the existing information and the data provided by the Monsanto Company, the Spanish Commission on Biosafety could give a favourable opinion to the renewal of commercialisation in the EU of maize MON810 if the proposals and conditions defined in this environmental risk assessment report are implemented"".        Since maize MON810 has no altered survival, multiplication or dissemination characteristics, the EFSA GMO Panel agrees with the assessment that the likelihood of unintended environmental effects due to the establishment and spread of maize MON810 will be no different from that of conventional maize varieties.        On the basis of the data provided by the applicant and obtained from a literature survey and a modelling exercise on the effect of the cultivation of maize MON810 on non-target lepidopteran species in representative maize cultivation regions in the European Union (EU), the EFSA GMO Panel concludes that the likelihood of adverse effects on non-target organisms or on ecological functions is very low, especially if appropriate mitigation measures are adopted. In agreement with the environmental risk assessment by the applicant and the assessment conducted by the Spanish Competent Authority and its Biosafety Commission, the EFSA GMO Panel identifies the possible evolution of resistance in target species, as a potential risk linked to the cultivation of maize MON810.        In conclusion, the EFSA GMO Panel considers that the information available for maize MON810 addresses the scientific comments raised by Member States and that maize MON810 is as safe as its conventional counterpart with respect to potential effects on human and animal health. The EFSA GMO Panel also concludes that maize MON810 is unlikely to have any adverse effect on the environment in the context of its intended uses, especially if appropriate management measures are put in place in order to mitigate possible exposure of non-target Lepidoptera. Moreover, the EFSA GMO Panel advises that pest resistance management strategies continue to be employed.

They were used 35% more frequently with nonparametric methods than with parametric ones and about twice as often in 1989 as in 2005. Debate in the psychological literature of the 1950s established the logical criterion that one-tailed tests should be restricted to situations where there is interest only in results in one direction. 'Interest' should be defined; however, in terms of collective or societal interest and not by the individual investigator. By this 'collective interest' criterion, all uses of one-tailed tests in the journals surveyed seem invalid. In his book Nonparametric Statistics, S. Siegel unrelentingly suggested the use of one-tailed tests whenever the investigator predicts the direction of a result. That work has been a major proximate source of confusion on this issue, but so are most recent statistics textbooks. The utility of one-tailed tests in research aimed at obtaining regulatory approval of new drugs and new pesticides is briefly described, to exemplify the narrow range of research situations where such tests can be appropriate. These situations are characterized by null hypotheses stating that the difference or effect size does not exceed, or is at least as great as, some 'amount of practical interest'. One-tailed tests rarely should be used for basic or applied research in ecology, animal behaviour or any other science.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  54     Total Times Cited:  66     Cited Reference Count:  131,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.01946.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),directional tests;hypothesis testing;non-parametric tests;one-sided tests;S.

In the Mediterranean Sea, however, modern field studies of cetaceans did not start until the late 1980s. Bottlenose dolphins have been studied only in relatively small portions of the basin, and wide areas remain largely unexplored.        This paper reviews the ecology, behaviour, interactions with fisheries and conservation status of Mediterranean bottlenose dolphins, and identifies threats likely to have affected them in historical and recent times.        Whilst intentional killing was probably the most important cause of mortality until the 1960s, important ongoing threats include incidental mortality in fishing gear and the reduced availability of key prey caused by overfishing and environmental degradation throughout the region. Additional potential or likely threats include the toxic effects of xenobiotic chemicals, epizootic outbreaks, direct disturbance from boating and shipping, noise, and the consequences of climate change.        The flexible social organization and opportunistic diet and behaviour of bottlenose dolphins may allow them to withstand at least some of the effects of overfishing and habitat degradation. However, dolphin abundance is thought to have declined considerably in the region and management measures are needed to prevent further decline.        Management strategies that could benefit bottlenose dolphins, such as sustainable fishing, curbing marine pollution and protecting biodiversity, are already embedded in legislation and treaties. Compliance with those existing commitments and obligations should be given high priority.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  151     Total Times Cited:  167     Cited Reference Count:  234,10.1111/j.1365-2907.2008.00133.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),bottlenose dolphin;cetaceans;conservation status;fisheries;Tursiops truncatus;STENELLA-COERULEOALBA;CLIMATE-CHANGE;POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS;MORBILLIVIRUS INFECTION;DELPHINUS-DELPHIS;STRIPED DOLPHINS;ORGANOCHLORINE CONTAMINANTS;CETACEAN DISTRIBUTION;ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS;ATLANTIC COAST,NA,NA,ecology and conservation of common bottlenose dolphins <i>tursiops truncatus<i> in the mediterranean sea

In mammals, cathelicidins have shown to possess potent broad-range antimicrobial activity as well as immunomodulatory activities. Therefore, we investigated the microbicidal activities and localization of Cathelicidin-2 in non-infected and Salmonella-challenged broiler chickens. Using immunohistochemistry, Cathelicidin-2 was shown to be abundantly present in heterophils, localized in the large rod-shaped granules, but absent in other peripheral blood cells and intestinal epithelial cells. Cathelicidin-2 synthesis was observed to be initiated at the early promyelocyte stage. Considerable infiltration of Cathelicidin-2 containing heterophils was observed in the jejunum of Salmonella enteritidis-challenged broilers within 8 h post-infection. Heterophils were shown to release mature Cathelicidin-2 peptide upon stimulation with Solmonello-derived LPS in a time-dependent way. Processing of the Cathelicidin-2 precursor was mediated by serine proteases with a divalent cation dependency. Cathelicidin-2 peptide showed potent bactericidal and fungicidal activity against all tested microorganisms, including chicken-specific Salmonella isolates. These results underscore the importance of avian heterophils as a first line of defence against invading pathogens and implicate that via heterophilmediated release, cathelicidins may greatly contribute to avian innate immunity.

This network aims at promoting discussions among scientists currently involved in marine microbial studies carried out at both the South American and the Caribbean regions, in order to evaluate the research capabilities and to identify complementary strengths and/or possibilities for enhanced collaboration, that would improve the knowledge on marine microbes and their biodiversity in both regions. We present an overview and discussion on some of the directions of current research on marine microbes in these regions. Concerning the marine phytoplankton studies, the best known taxonomic groups are diatoms and dinoflagellates. In Mexican marine waters, the number of taxa recorded to date is of about 1400. Studies dealing with bacterial, phytoplankton and/or cyanobacterial dynamics are carried out in the Caribbean coastal and oceanic marine systems, underscoring the importance of various environmental states, modulated by geographic and seasonal patterns as well as by the expression of large South American rivers. One of the main issues of this type of survey is the determination of wet and dry seasonal patterns of bacterial dynamics, in seascapes off Puerto Rico, with moderate to absent river inputs. Phytoplankton and bacterioplankton dynamics are also studied in F. Guiana coastal and shelf systems under direct Amazon influence, well known for their important fisheries resources, as well as in other South American marine systems influenced by important fresh water inputs or under upwelling conditions. Bacterial and/or picoeukaryotes diversity are assessed in particular marine systems such as coastal lagoons in Uruguay, the Rio de la Plata estuary and adjacent areas, as well as in sediments of the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) off South American Pacific coast, and in anoxic waters of the Cariaco Basin. Findings of a diverse range of pico-autotrophs (Patagonian shelf) and particular communities of big filamentous bacteria (OMZ zone off the South American Pacific) represent recent discoveries in those areas. In polluted coastal systems, bacteria with ability to degrade pesticides and hydrocarbons are currently monitored. In coastal areas of the Colombian Caribbean, 64 native marine bacterial strains were isolated from sediment samples. The oil-degrading bacteria are also studied in the Orinoco Delta, submitted to intensive oil exploitation. Furthermore, the Microbial Observatory of Rio de Janeiro (MoRio) established in Guanabara Bay (Brazil), constitutes a model for the study of threatened tropical coastal systems by exploring microbial biodiversity in different coastal systems (including unpolluted sites). The estimation of the activity and diversity of hydrocarbon and oil-degrading bacteria is assessed also in temperate waters and sediments of coastal systems of Argentina. Sharing knowledge and capabilities in common strategies would allow a better understanding of marine microbial diversity patterns in both regions. Rev. Biol. Trop. 56 (Suppl. 1): 183-214.

With biological invasions causing widespread problems in ecosystems, methods to curb the colonization success of invasive species are needed. The effective management of invasive species will require an integrated approach that restores community structure and ecosystem processes while controlling propagule pressure of non-native species.        2. We tested the hypotheses that restoring native vegetation and minimizing propagule pressure of invasive species slows the establishment of an invader. In field and greenhouse experiments, we evaluated (i) the effects of a native submersed aquatic plant species, Vallisneria americana, on the colonization success of a non-native species, Hydrilla verticillata; and (ii) the effects of H. verticillata propagule density on its colonization success.        3. Results from the greenhouse experiment showed that V. americana decreased H. verticillata colonization through nutrient draw-down in the water column of closed mesocosms, although data from the field experiment, located in a tidal freshwater region of Chesapeake Bay that is open to nutrient fluxes, suggested that V. americana did not negatively impact H. verticillata colonization. However, H. verticillata colonization was greater in a treatment of plastic V. americana look-alikes, suggesting that the canopy of V. americana can physically capture H. verticillata fragments. Thus pre-emption effects may be less clear in the field experiment because of complex interactions between competitive and facilitative effects in combination with continuous nutrient inputs from tides and rivers that do not allow nutrient draw-down to levels experienced in the greenhouse.        4. Greenhouse and field tests differed in the timing, duration and density of propagule inputs. However, irrespective of these differences, propagule pressure of the invader affected colonization success except in situations when the native species could draw-down nutrients in closed greenhouse mesocosms. In that case, no propagules were able to colonize.        5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown that reducing propagule pressure through targeted management should be considered to slow the spread of invasive species. This, in combination with restoration of native species, may be the best defence against non-native species invasion. Thus a combined strategy of targeted control and promotion of native plant growth is likely to be the most sustainable and cost-effective form of invasive species management.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  65     Total Times Cited:  78     Cited Reference Count:  42,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01384.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),colonization;invasive species;pre-emption;priority effect;submersed macrophyte;Vallisneria americana;HYDRELLIA-PAKISTANAE DIPTERA;VALLISNERIA-AMERICANA;EURASIAN WATERMILFOIL;HERBICIDE RESISTANCE;BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS;CHESAPEAKE-BAY;GRASS CARP;MACROPHYTES;COEXISTENCE;EVOLUTION;Immersion,NA,NA,effects of preexisting submersed vegetation and propagule pressure on the invasion success of <i>hydrilla verticillata<i>

Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed high expression of Gal-6 mRNA in the esophagus and crop, moderate expression in the glandular stomach, and low expression throughout the intestinal tract. Putative transcription factor binding sites for nuclear factor kappa beta, activator protein 1, and nuclear factor interleukin-6 were found in the Gal-6 gene upstream region, which suggests a possible inducible nature of the Gal-6 gene. In colony-counting assays, strong bactericidal and fungicidal activity was observed, including bactericidal activity against food-borne pathogens Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Clostridium perfringens, and Escherichia coli. Treatment with 16 mu g/ml synthetic Gal-6 resulted in a 3 log unit reduction in Clostridium perfringens survival within 60 min, indicating fast killing kinetics. Transmission electron microscopy examination of synthetic-Gal-6-treated Clostridium perfringens cells showed dose-dependent changes in morphology after 30 min, including intracellular granulation, cytoplasm retraction, irregular septum formation in dividing cells, and cell lysis.

The first mollusk big defensin (designated AiBD) cDNA was cloned from bay scallop Argopecten irradians by expressed sequence tag (EST) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) techniques. The scallop AiBD consisted of 531 nucleotides with a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA and a poly(A) tail, encoding a polypeptide of 122 amino acids. The high similarity of AiBD deduced amino acid sequence with big defensin from Tachypleus tridentatus and Branchiostoma belcheri tsingtaunese indicated that AiBD should be a member of big defensin family. The expression of AiBD in various tissues was measured by using Northern blotting analysis. mRNA transcripts of AiBD could be detected in haemocytes of unchallenged scallops. The temporal expression of AiBD in haemolymph after Vibrio anguilarum challenge was recorded by quantitative real time PCR. The relative expression level of AiBD in haemolymph was up-regulated evenly in the first 8 h, followed by a drastic increase, and increased 131.1-fold at 32 h post-injection. These results indicated that AiBD could be induced by bacterial challenge, and it should participate in the immune responses of A. irradians. Biological activity assay revealed that recombinant AiBD could inhibit the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and also showed strong fungicidal activity towards the expression host. Recombinant expression of AiBD made it possible to further characterize its functions involved in immune responses, and also provided a potential therapeutic agent for disease control in aquaculture.

Elevated stress may compromise host insect defenses, thus increasing its vulnerability to nematode infection. Specifically, we investigated the effects of stressors on Heterorhabditis bacteriophora infection of Tenebrio molitor larva. The stressors included temperature extremes, insecticidal oils and metal cations. Most chemical stressor-nematode combinations caused high host mortality and low infectivity rates. However, infective juvenile stimulation by the cation Mn2+ did enhance infectivity compared to the control. Dry heat (40 degrees C for 30 min) and hot water (60-70 degrees C for I s) treatments increased the host's susceptibility to H. bacteriophora infection with respect to unstressed controls, and the yields and virulence of infective juveniles produced in hosts stressed by these treatments were not affected.

Genetic analysis suggests that B. dendrobatidis is a recently emerged pathogen. This article reviews the biology of this pathogenic chytrid and the evidence for chytridiomycosis as a cause of declines in amphibian populations worldwide. Data are presented to show that antimicrobial peptides, produced in granular glands of the skin and released in high concentrations into skin secretions, are highly effective in inhibiting growth of B. dendrobatidis in vitro and may provide limited protection for some species. Ongoing studies suggest a correlation between resistance to lethal infection by B. dendrobatidis and synthesis of antimicrobial peptides by the host amphibian, but further research is needed to define better the role of antimicrobial peptides in protection of amphibian populations and the effect of environmental factors upon antimicrobial peptide synthesis.

These chemicals mostly act on the growth of M oryzae by exhibiting specific fungicidal effects on the pathogen. The wide use of these site specific chemicals sometimes causes development of resistance in the pathogens. In fact, resistance against kasugamycin and organophosphorus thiolate fungicides were recognized in the field where they were too intensively used. Solutions to the problem were contrived for the effective use of the chemicals at hand, such as application of mixtures with different action mechanisms or their use in rotation. While all modem fungicides are developed through extensive safety evaluation, there is a deep public concern about their side effects on non-target organisms and on the environment.        Thus there is a great deal of interest in non-fungicidal disease controlling agents since they are supposedly specific to target organisms and are less likely to lead to resistance problems. Actually, two groups of non-fungicidal rice blast chemicals are currently on the market; melanin biosynthesis inhibitors (MBIs), e.g., fthalide, tricyclazole, pyroquilon, carpropamid, diclocymet and fenoxanil, and the so called priming effectors or plant defense activators such as probenazole, acibenzolar-S-methyl and tiadmil, which induce host resistance against the pathogen's attack.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  34,,BLASTICIDIN-S DEAMINASE;SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED-RESISTANCE;MELANIN BIOSYNTHESIS;ASPERGILLUS-TERREUS;PYRICULARIA-ORYZAE;FUNGICIDE;TRICYCLAZOLE;PURIFICATION;INHIBITION;EXPRESSION;Oryza sativa,NA,NA,overview on the chemical control of rice blast disease

Fungal biological control agents have several mechanisms of action that allow them to control pathogens, including mycoparasitism, production of antibiotics or enzymes, competition for nutrients and the induction of plant host defences. While effective in the control of plant diseases, these mechanisms may pose risks to non-target species including mycorrhizal and saprophytic fungi, soil bacteria, plants, insects, aquatic and terrestrial animals, and humans. Non-target effects including mycoparasitism of mycorrhizae, reduction in plant root colonisation by mycorrhizal fungi, disorders in commercial mushrooms and nodulation by Rhizobium spp., and changes in plant growth have been associated with fungal biological control agents, such as Trichoderma spp. Also, the genera Tricho-derma and Gliocladium have been linked to respiratory disorders and shellfish toxicity in humans, respectively. Biological control agents, such as Pythium oligandrum, Talaromyces flavus, Coniothyrium minitans and Ampelomyces quisqualis have modes of action which may pose risks to non-target fungi, bacteria, plants and animals. There is need for future research into ecological impacts associated with the release of any biological agent and methods of determining possible non-target effects. Adequate monitoring and the use of molecular techniques to identify and follow the movement of biological control agents are needed to examine and mitigate negative biological impacts.

The reinstallation of arboreal ants was slow as 2 yr after insecticide treatment ceased differences with the control lots were significant; This intermediary period also illustrated that arboreal ants can found and develop colonies on trees occupied by ground-nesting species. Certain arboreal species were more frequent during this intermediary period than on the control lots, showing that the period of installation in the trees was followed by competition between arboreal ants. We confirm that ground-nesting ants tend a wide range of hemipteran families, including well known agricultural pests, whereas arboreal ants, particularly dominant species, were mostly associated with Coccidae and Stictococcidae that do not pose problems to the supporting trees. A tree effect was also noted for both ant and hemipteran distribution. We concluded that because of insecticide use, ground-nesting ants pose problems through their associated Hemiptera.

The biological inducers include necrotizing pathogens, non-pathogens or root colonizing bacteria. Through at network of signal pathways they induce resistance spectra and marker proteins that are characteristic for the different plant species and activation systems. The best characterized signal pathway for systemically induced resistance is SAR (systemic acquired resistance) that is activated by localized infections with necrotizing pathogens. It is characterized by protection against a broad range of pathogens, by a set of induced proteins and by its dependence on salicylic acid (SA) Various chemicals have been discovered that seem to act at various points in these defense activating networks and mimic all or parts of the biological activation of resistance. Of these, only few have reached commercialization. The best-studied resistance activator is acibenzolar-5-methyl (BION). At low rates it activates resistance in many crops against a broad spectrum of diseases, including fungi, bacteria and viruses. In monocots, activated resistance by BION typically is very long lasting, while the lasting effect is less pronounced in dicots. BION is translocated systemically in plants and can take the place of SA in the natural SAR signal pathway, inducing the same spectrum of resistance and the same set of molecular markers. Probenazole (ORYZEMATE) is used mainly on rice against rice blast and bacterial leaf blight. Its mode of action is not well understood partly because biological systems of systemically induced resistance are not well defined in rice. Treated plants clearly respond faster and in a resistant manner to infections by the two pathogens. Other compounds like beta-aminobutyric acid as wdl as extracts from plants and microorganisms have also been described as resistance inducers. For most of these, neither the mode of action nor reliable pre-challenge markers are known and still other pathways for resistance activation are suspected. Resistance inducing chemicals that are able to induce broad disease resistance offer an additional option for the farmer to complement genetic disease resistance and the use of fungicides. If integrated properly in plant health management programs, they can prolong the useful life of both the resistance genes and the fungicides presently used.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  345     Total Times Cited:  403     Cited Reference Count:  48,10.1023/A:1008760518772     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),acibenzolar-S-methyl;BABA;carpropamide;induced resistance;probenazole;salicylic acid;SAR;SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED-RESISTANCE;TOBACCO MOSAIC-VIRUS;SALICYLIC-ACID;PHYTOPHTHORA-INFESTANS;SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION;ACCUMULATION;ARABIDOPSIS;INDUCTION;ACTIVATORS;EXPRESSION,NA,NA,induced disease resistance in plants by chemicals

In mode-of-action studies, the inhibitory action of carpropamid can be counteracted by supplying the melanin intermediate 1,8-DHN2, which lies beyond the points of inhibition in the melanin biosynthetic pathway. When 1,8-DHN was applied to inoculated, carpropamid-treated plants, 30% of P. oryzae appressoria were melanized compared to 5% without 1,8-DHN. The pigmented appressoria penetrated the host normally and as frequently as on control plants (45%), but fungal invasion was arrested shortly after penetration. This abatement of fungal growth was associated with increased lignification of invaded host cells. Lignification is a typical reaction of resistant rice varieties and of rice plants with acquired resistance.

They play an important role in crop production as well as in livestock and fisheries. Women are effective managers of farming operations to a much greater degree than what is evident from national statistics because it is not socially acceptable for women to be involved in the field of agriculture. Women in very small land holding have the highest involvement in agriculture, followed by women in landless, small and medium sized holdings.        Most household fruit and vegetable gardens that supplement the family food consumption become the women's responsibility. The male members are more involved in fertilizer and insecticide applications and in selling the produce to the market. Women are more involved in seed collection, seed storage, water management, fertilizer application daily maintenance, harvesting and even in field-laced vegetable production. Women and children's participation is predominant in weeding, watering and specially, harvesting of different vegetables and spices.        In case of tribal people, vegetable growing fields are mostly cared for by the women. The tribal women of Garo, Chakma and Marma are traditionally managers and workers of their agricultural lands. Urban women are also often found to be eager to grow vegetables in the homestead.        The contribution of homestead crops to the total food production has remained largely invisible. Its contribution to the family income is even less known, although there are indications that such income could be quite significant. The performance of small, marginal and landless households in terms of average returns per decimal of homestead land is reported to be far superior from large household due to more intensive labor inputs on the part of women in poor households. Traditionally, rural and urban women are also involved in home preservation of vegetables. Women's contribution to family health and nutrition is highly important.        One-third to half of vegetables, spices, and fruits grown in the homestead are sold to supplement the family income. Among homestead activities, vegetable cultivation contributes two to six percent and tree cultivation is one to 22 % of total income varying according to location. Although, women are primarily responsible for homestead crop production, the marketing of homestead produced is not entirely under their control, In general, women in landless, marginal, and small farm households are directly involved in marketing of fruits and vegetables more often than women in medium and large households.        Women control their income in nearly all female headed households, irrespective of homestead size. In male headed households the control of income varies considerably according to who sells homestead crops. When the wife sells the crops or the children, the wife retains control to most of the income.        Because of their wide and long-standing experience with women groups and members, NGOs are promoting the participation of women in vegetable production, consumption and utilization. But the extent of their institutional support to women in vegetable production varies considerably.

Subjects were divided into 4 groups on the basis of sample medians for frequency of illness from the foods (FI) and chemicals (CI): high FI with high CI (FI/CI), high FI alone, high CI alone, and NOILL (low FI and CI).

Nevertheless, the FI/CI, FI, and/or CI groups still had significantly higher total symptom scores as well as more indigestion, headache, and memory trouble than did the NOILL group, even after depression, anxiety, shyness, defensiveness, and gender were covaried. The illness groups reported significantly more limitation of foods that mobilize endogenous opioids or generate exogenous opioids (sweets, fats, bread) as well as more illness from opiate drugs, small amounts of beverage alcohol, and late meals. Nasal symptoms from pollens or animals were more common in the FI/CI (42%) and CI (42%) than in FI (26%) or NOILL (28%) groups. Premenstrual tension syndrome and irritable bowel were also more common in the FI/CI group. The findings indicate that young adults outside the clinical setting who are relatively higher in FI and/or CI have distinctive symptom and psychological patterns. Covariate analyses suggest that important symptoms in FI and CI individuals such as indigestion, headache, and memory problems may occur in addition to rather than as simply part of emotional distress.

The regulatory requirement for mutagenicity testing to support a pesticide registration is found in the 40 CFR Part 158. The guidance as to the specific mutagenicity testing to be performed is found in the OPP's Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, Subdivision F, Hazard Evaluation: Human and Domestic Animals (referred to as the Subdivision F guideline).        A revised Subdivision F guideline has been presented that becomes the current guidance for submitters of mutagenicity data to the OPP. The decision to revise the guideline was the result of close examination of the version published in 1982 and the desire to update the guidance based on developments since then and current state-of-the-science. After undergoing Agency and public scrutiny, the revised guideline is to be published in 1991.        The revised guideline consists of an initial battery of tests (the Salmonella assay, an in vitro mammalian gene mutation assay and an in vivo cytogenetics assay which may be either a bone marrow assay for chromosomal aberrations or for micronuclei formation) that should provide an adequate initial assessment of the potential mutagenicity of a chemical. Follow-up testing to clarify results from the initial testing may be necessary. After this information as well as all other relevant information is obtained, a weight-of-evidence decision will be made about the possible mutagenicity concern a chemical may present. Testing to pursue qualitative and/or quantitative evidence for assessing heritable risk in relation to human beings will then be considered if a mutagenicity concern exists. This testing may range from tests for evidence of gonadal exposure to dominant lethal testing to quantitative tests such as the specific locus and heritable translocation assays. The mutagenicity assessment will be performed in accordance with the Agency's Mutagenicity Risk Assessment Guidelines. The mutagenicity data would also be used in the weight-of-evidence consideration for the potential carcinogenicity of a chemical in accordance with the Agency's Carcinogen Risk Assessment Guidelines. In instances where there are triggers for carcinogenicity testing, mutagenicity data may be used as one of the triggers after a consideration of available information.        It is felt that the revised Subdivision F guideline will provide appropriate, and more specific, guidance concerning the OPP approach to mutagenicity testing for the registration of a pesticide. It also provides a clearer understanding of how the OPP will proceed with its evaluation and decision making concerning the potential heritable effects of a test chemical.        OTS - As a result of recent information in the field of mutagenicity (the Williamsburg meeting, its precedents and sequelae), a modification to the Section 4 test scheme has been proposed. In the proposal, test schemes for gene mutation and chromosomal aberrations are combined. The revision comprises three tests in the initial tier: the Salmonella assay, an in vitro assay for gene mutation and an in vivo assay for chromosomal effects which may be either a bone marrow assay for chromosomal aberrations or the micronucleus assay.        Since submission of this article for publication, the proposed OTS test scheme has been approved by OTS management. The old two scheme, four test scheme is no longer in effect, and will no longer be used in future TSCA Section 4 Test Rules.        Under Section 5 of TSCA (""new"" chemical, or Premanufacture Notice (PMN)), mutagenicity data are used for three purposes: (1) as part of exposure based testing; (2) to assess the potential of the PMN chemical to induce heritable genetic effects; and (3) as part of the weight-of-evidence that a chemical may be a potential carcinogen.        As part of the exposure based testing program, the USEPA has required testing of certain high volume chemicals with a two test battery of the Salmonella assay and a mouse micronucleus assay. In supporting a concern for potential carcinogenicity of a PMN chemical, the USEPA generally cites data on an analogue which is known to be carcinogenic (i.e., demonstrated tumor forming ability in one or more animal studies). In such instances, mutagenicity data on the PMN chemical or on the analogues are used to lend support to the case for potential carcinogenicity. Where there is no analogue of the PMN chemical which has been tested for carcinogenicity, mutagenicity data alone are generally not considered sufficient to support a concern for potential carcinogenicity. Regulatory action under Section 5 is seldom, if ever, taken on the basis of mutagenicity data alone, especially on the basis of in vitro mutagenicity data.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  103     Total Times Cited:  105     Cited Reference Count:  66,10.1016/0165-1110(91)90012-K     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),UNITED-STATES-ENVIRONMENTAL-PROTECTION-AGENCY;MUTAGENICITY TEST PROCEDURES;GENE-TOX PROGRAM;MOUSE LYMPHOMA-CELLS;SHORT-TERM TESTS;THYMIDINE KINASE LOCUS;RESISTANT TFT MUTANTS;SALMONELLA MUTAGENICITY;COST-EFFECTIVENESS;HUMAN CARCINOGENS;TEST INFORMATION;TOXICITY;United States,NA,NA,considerations in the unitedstatesenvironmentalprotectionagency testing approach for mutagenicity

Nonetheless, the latter phenomenon is frequently neglected. Their spatial dependence and mapping are also seldom considered and when complexes of related pest species are involved, such as the rice stink bugs from the Neotropics, Oebalus poecilus, and O. ypsilongriseus, the scenario is even worst. Insecticide use is common against both species, particularly with the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, and despite suspicion of a shift in O. poecilus historical dominance and complaints of control failure, the role of this insecticide in this context was never tested. Thus, we screened populations from both species for thiamethoxam resistance within rice fields from central Brazil. The levels of thiamethoxam resistance and control failure likelihood were recorded and their spatial dependence was tested and geographically mapped. The thiamethoxam potency was similar between species, which also exhibited overlapping levels of resistance. Thus, this insecticide does not seem involved in eventual shifts in species dominance and the occurrence of O. ypsilongriseus is frequent. Thiamethoxam resistance was detected in both species, nearly half of the populations of O. poecilus and about a third of O. ypsilongriseus, but at low levels (< ten-fold). As a consequence, the risk of control failure with thiamethoxam was also low. Spatial dependence was significant for both species and phenomena (i.e., thiamethoxam resistance and control failure), prevailing in about the same area and likely reflecting the local pattern of insecticide use. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: R.N.C.

The lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) is a vulnerable species found in nearshore water habitats. The mechanisms by which this fish responds to TBT exposure are not yet fully understood. Histological, biochemical, and transcriptional analyses were conducted, and the results showed that 60 days of exposure to 50 and 500 ng/L TBT caused significant tin accumulation and liver damage to seahorses. Antioxidant defenses and immune responses to TBT exposure in the livers of seahorses were further investigated. The enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde content increased, while catalase activity decreased. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that a series of genes involved in the antioxidant defense system were highly induced to protect the hepatic cells from oxidative damage. TBT exposure also resulted in the induction of genes associated with immune and inflammatory processes, representing a stress response to combat the adverse environmental conditions in the exposed seahorses. Furthermore, seahorses showed an increased health risk, according to the elevation of the expression of genes with tumor-promoting effects, when exposed to TBT.

In the present study, using gas chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS), we aimed to develop and validate a straightforward, robust, and reproducible cleanup method with acceptable recoveries for diverse compound classes with a wide range of physicochemical properties representative of pollutant screening in biota extracts. We compared Oasis PRiME HLB cartridges, Agilent Captiva EMR-Lipid cartridges, and “Freeze-Out” with salmon lipids spiked with 113 target chemicals. The EMR-Lipid cartridges provided extracts with low matrix effects at reproducible recoveries of the multi-class target analytes (93 ± 9% and 95 ± 7% for low and high lipid amounts, respectively). The EMR-Lipid cartridges were further tested with spiked pork lipids submitted to total extraction or silicone-based passive sampling. Reproducible recoveries were achieved and matrix residuals were largely removed as demonstrated gravimetrically for both types of extracts. Ion suppression of halogenated compounds was not as efficiently removed by the cleanup of total and silicone-based extracts of pork lipids as for the salmon lipids. However, the samples with clean up provided better instrument robustness than those without cleanup. Hence, EMR-Lipid cartridges were shown to be efficient as a cleanup method in multi-class monitoring of biota samples and open up new possibilities as a suitable cleanup method for silicone extracts in biota passive sampling studies using GC-HRMS analysis.

The concentrations of Hg measured in fish were mistakenly reported in dry-weight rather than wet-weight units. The main conclusions do not change for the relative Hg concentrations in fish and correlations of Hg concentrations with organic contaminants and omega-3 fatty acids. However, since the levels of Hg decreased after adjustment to wet weight concentrations, the conclusions of the risk assessment for some of the fish types has changed, with fewer fish types having restricted consumption advice.

ABSTRACT Consumption of seafood brings health benefits but may increase the ingestion of contaminants. Compared with other ethnic groups in the U.S., Asians consume seafood more frequently. However, there is little information about how culturally specific fish consumption contributes to exposure to toxicants. In this work, we surveyed fish consumption among Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese communities and purchased 103 seafood samples from local markets in Chicago. Each sample was analyzed for mercury (Hg) and 92 organic chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and Dechlorane Plus and related compounds (DPs). The rank order of pollutant concentration in all samples was Hg ≫ Σ66PCBs > Σ17OCPs > Σ8PBDEs > Σ8DPs. Positive correlations were noted among most contaminant groups. Bluefish, pike, tuna steak, and albacore tuna had the highest mean Hg (>300 ng/g). The mean Σ66PCBs was highest in pike and bluefish (>100 ng/g) followed by pollock and mackerel (>40 ng/g). Overall, octopus, shrimp and tilapia were the least contaminated; while pike, bluefish, and pollock were the most contaminated. Omega-3 fatty acids were more strongly affiliated with the organic contaminants than mercury. A risk assessment identified seven types of fish that should have consumption limitations and six that should not be consumed. For these seafoods, consumption advice based on Hg levels would adequately protect health, except for mackerel. In the survey participants, 10.3% of seafood mass consumed is from types of fish that should be limited to 1 or 2 meals/week, while 1.3% of the seafood mass consumed comes from types that should not be consumed at all. This work adds additional contaminants to the profile of health risks resulting from fish consumption among Asian Americans, which can be used in interventions aimed at conserving consumption of healthy fish while avoiding contaminants.

Homeopathy is one of the techniques for organic agriculture currently authorized by the MAPA. Aims: To assess the effect of homeopathic compounds on corncob quality in pesticide-free cultures. Methodology: The experiment was performed in, MS-Brazil. Two culture fields were used, each 30m2in size. The homeopathic group treatment consisted of 1ml of30% hydroalcoholic solution with homeopathic ingredients. This solution was diluted into 30ml of water and then sprayed onto 100 seeds. The control group was submitted to the same protocol excluding the homeopathic ingredients. The homeopathic ingredients used were Sulph9C, Mag-c 12C, and Calc-p9C, prescribed according to Materia Medica instructions. The evaluation was performed at harvest by comparing the average weight of 1000 kernels per group, obtained from a weighing of 3000 kernels per group. In addition, a number of corncobs from both groups were qualitatively evaluated as “good” or “bad.” Statistics analysis used the T-test to compare the kernel weight averages and Fisher's exact test to analyze the corncob quality frequency. Both groups were naturally infected by a virus from a neighboring sugarcane field, causing qualitative and quantitative losses on both groups. Results and discussion: The average weight of 1000 kernels from the treated group (329 g) was not significantly greater (p=0.06) than the average weight of 1000 kernels from the non-treated group (308 g). It was observed that 71out of 158 (44.9%) corncobs from the homeopathic treatment group were classified as “good” while zero out of 50 (0%) corncobs from the non-treated group were classified as “good”, resulting in a significant difference (p<0.01). Conclusion: Homeopathic compounds can be used as a feasible treatment for health and productivity in the corn crop. © 2022. International Journal of High Dilution Research.

Here we applied the eDNA metabarcoding to characterize the structures and spatial variations of zooplankton and fish communities among different habitat types in a highly dynamic and complex freshwater ecosystem of the Daqing River basin (DRB). The results showed that varied species spectra of zooplankton and fish communities were identified and unique dominant species occurred across habitats. Additionally, markedly spatial distributions of biotic community structures were observed in areas with different habitat characteristics. Natural variables, including geographic distances and gradient ratio, as well as anthropogenic factors of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and organic chemicals demonstrated significant effects but different outcomes on the structures of zooplankton and fish communities. Moreover, the relative abundances of specific aquatic taxa were associated with the gradient of particular environmental variables. This case study verified the distribution patterns and differentiation mechanisms of biotic communities under habitat heterogeneity could be captured by application of eDNA biomonitoring.

Blockchain, as an immutable and decentralized ledger, is able to optimize the traditional traceability system by ensuring the transparency and reliability of the system data. However, the use of blockchain technology may lead to a rapid increase in the complexity of system design and development. It is challenging to address widespread and complicated business, changeable processes, and massive data in practice, which are the main factors restricting the wide application of a blockchain-based traceability system (BTS). Therefore, in this paper, we reviewed relevant studies and proposed a reference architecture for BTSs. The proposed reference architecture can improve the cohesiveness, maintainability, and extensibility of BTSs through domain-driven design (DDD) and microservices. Considering the efficiency reduction caused by massive data and complicated data structure, we further changed the traditional single blockchain framework into multiple subchain networks, which could improve development efficiency and system performance. With the guidance of the architecture trade-off analysis method (ATAM), we evaluated our reference architecture and implemented a prototype in the salmon supply chain scenario. The results show that our solution is effective and adaptable to meet the requirements of BTSs.  © 2022 IEEE.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: S.

Though the biological significance of the hydrogen sulfide/cystathionine lyase system in disease states is extensively discussed, the absence of molecular methods for direct monitoring of cystathionine lyase in complex biosamples renders the result unreliable and perplexing. Here, we present the first attempt at designing and developing effective activatable fluorescent probes for cystathionine lyase based on the naphthylamide scaffold. CBLP and CSEP were designed based on the catalytic preference of cystathionine β-lyase (CBL) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE). Briefly, incorporation of cysteine/homocysteine as the recognition moiety and a carbamate ethyl sulfide group as a self-immolated linker proved to be an effective strategy for cystathionine lyase fluorescence reporting. CBLP exhibits high selectivity and sensitivity in vitro in semiquantifying CBL levels in roots of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and cbl mutants (cbl knockout: SALK_014740C, overexpressed: OE-CBL). Meanwhile, CSEP successfully detected CSE levels in HCC-LM3 cells, zebrafish models, and upregulated CSE in frozen section slides from the liver tissue of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced septic rats, which was also validated by Western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis. In summary, the practical design strategy facilitates profiling of cystathionine lyase activity in biological processes.

Ferroptosis is a type of inflammatory cell death induced by intracellular iron-dependent accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides. Although ferroptosis has been associated with cancer and other sterile diseases, very little is known about the role of ferroptosis in modulating host-pathogen interactions. We show that accumulation of the secondary messenger bis-(3′,5′)-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) in the pathogenic bacterium Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida) triggers a non-canonical ferroptosis pathway in infected HeLa cells. Moreover, we observed that the dysregulation of c-di-GMP in E. piscicida promotes iron accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and production of reactive oxygen species, all of which that can be blocked by iron chelator. Importantly, unlike classical ferroptosis that is executed via excess lipid peroxidation, no lipid peroxidation was detected in the infected cells. Furthermore, lipoxygenases inhibitors and lipophilic antioxidants are not able to suppress morphological changes and cell death induced by E. piscicida mutant producing excess c-di-GMP, and this c-di-GMP dysregulation attenuates bacterial virulence in vivo. Collectively, our results reveal a novel non-canonical ferroptosis pathway mediated by bacterial c-di-GMP and provide evidence for a role of ferroptosis in the regulation of pathogen infection.

The toxicity assessments of SM in model organisms are currently rare. In the present study, zebrafish were utilized for evaluating the detrimental effects of SM in aquatic vertebrates. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/L SM from 5.5 to 72 h post-fertilization (hpf), respectively. Consequently, SM exposure resulted in increasing the mortality rate and reducing hatching rate in larval zebrafish at 10, 20, and 40 mg/L SM-treated groups. The reduced numbers of immune cells (neutrophils and macrophages) were observed after SM exposure by a dose-dependent manner. The inflammatory responses (TLR4, MYD88, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ, IL-10, and TGF-β) were measured to estimate immune responses. Anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10 and TGF-β) were down-regulated in all the treated groups and significantly altered at 40 mg/L exposure group. Additionally, behavioral tests suggested that SM treatment significantly increased the total distance, average speed, and maximum acceleration of larval zebrafish during light-dark transition and subsequently enzymology test displayed the same trend to locomotor behaviors. The content significantly increased in oxidative stress, as reflected in ROS level in all the treated groups. The numbers of cell apoptosis were significantly increased at 20, and 40 mg/L and the highest concentration group induced the substantial increment (P < 0.001) of apoptosis-related genes including p53, Bax/Bcl-2, caspase-9, and caspase-3.

Most cases of ASD arise from a confluence of genetic susceptibility and environmental risk factors, whose interactions can be studied through epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. While various parental factors are known to increase risk for ASD, several studies have indicated that grandparental and great-grandparental factors may also contribute. In animal studies, gestational exposure to certain environmental factors, such as insecticides, medications, and social stress, increases risk for altered behavioral phenotypes in multiple subsequent generations. Changes in DNA methylation, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility often accompany these altered behavioral phenotypes, with changes often appearing in genes that are important for neurodevelopment or have been previously implicated in ASD. One hypothesized mechanism for these phenotypic and methylation changes includes the transmission of DNA methylation marks at individual chromosomal loci from parent to offspring and beyond, called multigenerational epigenetic inheritance. Alternatively, intermediate metabolic phenotypes in the parental generation may confer risk from the original grandparental exposure to risk for ASD in grandchildren, mediated by DNA methylation. While hypothesized mechanisms require further research, the potential for multigenerational epigenetics assessments of ASD risk has implications for precision medicine as the field attempts to address the variable etiology and clinical signs of ASD by incorporating genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. In this review, we discuss the promise of multigenerational DNA methylation investigations in understanding the complex etiology of ASD.

We synthesized peer-reviewed literature reporting molecular and physiological responses in zebrafish following exposure to BPF, as BPF is closely related to BPA structure and is a dominant replacement chemical in the marketplace. Global concentrations of BPF in aquatic environments were compiled and compared to physiological and behavioral impacts reported in zebrafish (e.g., developmental abnormalities, oxidative stress, immunotoxicity, endocrine disruption, and neurotoxicity). Using computational approaches, we elucidate BPF-mediated molecular networks and reveal novel biomarkers associated with BPF exposure. Functional classes of proteins including inflammatory cytokines, ATPases, peroxidases, and aromatic L-amino decarboxylases represent novel, underexplored targets of toxicity. Most revealing of this critical review is that few studies report biological responses to BPF at levels present in aquatic environments. Recommendations for future investigations based on knowledge gaps include: (1) Mechanistic studies in the central nervous system of zebrafish to address neurotoxicity; (2) Behavioral assays in zebrafish that assess the effects of BPF on anxiolytic, social, and fear-related behaviors; (3) Studies that broaden understanding of potential endocrine disrupting effects of BPF, for example insulin signaling is predicted to be sensitive to BPF exposure; (4) Studies into metabolic disruption with a focus on glutathione and aromatic amino acids, based upon pathway analysis data; (5) Studies utilizing mixture exposures with other BPA analogs to reflect environmental conditions more accurately. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: C.J.

However, disease outbreaks have hindered the development of its cultivation. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a group of important components in fish innate immune system, that are active in the first line of defense against pathogens. The piscidin family, which are a group of fish-specific AMPs, have been isolated in a part of teleost but still poorly understood in S. schlegelii. In this study, three piscidin genes (Ss-piscidin1, 2, 3) are identified in S. schlegelii and their antibacterial activities and related mechanisms are analyzed. Three Ss-piscidins have conserved signal peptides but highly variable mature peptides and prodomains, and their mature regions all have predicted amphipathic and α-helical structures. Phylogenetic analysis shows that three Ss-piscidins cluster with different fish piscidin sequences into three sister clades, which correspond to three groups of fish piscidin family, respectively. Ss-piscidins have constitutive expressions in different tissues of healthy fish and enhanced expressions after Aeromonas salmonicida challenge. All three piscidins exhibit antibacterial activities, and are able to enhance bacterial membrane permeability and change bacterial morphology to different degrees, with a positive correlation observed among these activities. This suggests that three peptides exert their antibacterial activity through a “membrane-attack” mechanism. Moreover, hemolytic activities of three piscidins are also analyzed, and Ss-piscidin1, with low hemolytic ability and high antibacterial activity, is considered to be a possible candidate template for design of AMP drugs. Results in this study can promote a better understanding of immune responses in black rockfish and facilitate the future development of strategies in fish disease control in aquaculture. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: C.

They retain fine sediments, nutrients and pesticides, improve channel hydromorphology, control water temperature and primary production through shading and provide leaves, twigs and large wood. In a recent conceptual model (Feld et al., 2018), woody riparian functions were considered either independent from large-scale landuse stressors (e.g. shading, input of organic matter), or dependent on landuse at larger spatial scales (e.g. fine sediment, nutrient and pesticide retention). We tested this concept using high-resolution data on woody riparian vegetation cover and empirical data from 1017 macroinvertebrate sampling sites in German lowland and mountain streams. Macroinvertebrate metrics indicative for individual functions were used as response variables in structural equation models (SEM), representing the hierarchical structure between the different considered stressors at different spatial scales: catchment, upstream riparian, local riparian and local landuse cover along with hydromorphology and water quality. The analysis only partly confirmed the conceptual model: Biotic integrity and water quality were strongly related to large-scale stressors as expected (absolute total effect 0.345–0.541), but against expectations, fine sediments retention, considered scale-dependent in the conceptual model, was poorly explained by large-scale stressors (absolute total effect 0.027–0.231). While most functions considered independent from large-scale landuse were partly explained by riparian landuse cover (absolute total effect 0.023–0.091) they also were nonetheless affected by catchment landuse cover (absolute total effect 0.017–0.390). While many empirical case studies at smaller spatial scales clearly document the positive effects of restoring woody riparian vegetation, our results suggest that most effects of riparian landuse cover are possibly superimposed by larger-scale stressors. This does not negate localized effects of woody riparian vegetation but helps contextualize limitations to successful restoration measures targeting the macroinvertebrate community. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: M.

Objective: This investigation aims to isolate bioactive compounds from the leaf acetone extract of Terminalia catappa and to evaluate their antimicrobial potential against human pathogenic organisms. Materials and Methods: The bioactive extract was subjected to column chromatography. The fractions were assessed for their minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum fungicidal concentration, and time kill assays. UHPLC-MS/MS analysis was used to identify the bioactive molecules in the fraction. Results: The isolated fraction exhibited antimicrobial activity, with the most sensitive being Staphylococcus aureus (clinical isolate) and Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus 1503 (0.097 mg/mL), and the fungi Trichophyton rubrum and Candida albicans were inhibited at 0.097 mg/mL. The time kill assay exhibited bactericidal properties towards S. aureus (clinical isolate) and Salmonella typhi (MTCC 733). Additionally, MRSA 1503 and Proteus vulgaris exhibited bacteriostatic activities. The UHPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed that the fraction was rich in polyphenols. Alkaloids and some ellagitannins were identified for the first time. Conclusion: The results highlight the significant inhibition of multidrug-resistant MRSA strains and fungi by the polyphenol-rich fraction.

Although excess nutrient loading has been a problem in the past, the dominance of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) was considered to be a substantial factor driving and sustaining eutrophic conditions. To remove carp and restore the fish community, the lake was treated with rotenone in late 2009 and then restocked with native species. All water quality variables improved after carp removal, with mean values (May–Sep) for chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, and turbidity decreasing by 80% to 93% and Secchi disk transparency increasing nearly 600% when comparing means of pre- to post-treatment years. Macrophyte coverage also improved, from means of 4.6% before treatment to 90% after treatment, indicating a shift from an algal- to a macrophyte-dominated system. Sediment phosphorus (P) storage increased significantly after carp removal as well, with labile (releasable) forms of P increasing in the upper 10 cm of sediment in all cores (n = 7). The decrease in water column P equaled the increase in labile sediment P forms after treatment, indicating carp were a key driver of P transport from sediment to water. The results of this study indicate that an ecological (i.e., both abiotic and biotic) approach is needed when managing eutrophic lakes because management of nutrients alone will not likely be adequate to restore water quality in systems dominated by carp or other large benthic feeding fish. © 2021 The Author(s).

This study assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices related to ecological engineering among participating and non-participating farmers. Interviews with 315 farmers revealed a diversity of practices under the umbrella of ecological engineering, all of which were associated with the establishment of linear vegetation strips as habitat for natural enemies. As a restoring service from society to the rice ecosystem, ecological engineering incorporated significant positive-feedback loops, particularly regarding the production of supplementary foods (provisioning services) and the aesthetic value (cultural services) of planted rice bunds. Participating farmers reported fewer insecticide applications to their main rice crop; they applied insecticides at a later crop growth stage (protecting pest regulating services); and they reported higher rice yields. However, a high dependency on government support, the role of agrochemical extensionists in providing information, a tendency to apply pesticides to vegetation strips and little change in the appreciation of wildlife-related services all threaten the social sustainability of the intervention.

Anthropic pressures, however, in the form of rapid urbanization, excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, land use and climate change are diminishing the water quality, which necessitates better insights into pollution variability and its controlling measures. In this study, the water quality parameters including temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), oxidation–reduction potential, dissolved oxygen (DO), total hardness, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Fe3+, NH4+, NO3−, PO43−, Cl−, HCO3−, CO2 and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were investigated in the Jagadishpur Reservoir (a Ramsar Site, Reference No. 1315) in 2019. The data were analyzed using multivariate techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA). Additionally, the drinking and irrigational suitability of water was evaluated by water quality index (WQI); EC, Na%, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and magnesium hazard (MH), and also compared with the WHO guideline. The mean pH in the reservoir is found to be 8.01 exhibiting alkaline nature, and the ionic dominancy order is Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ > NH4+ > Fe3+, and HCO3− > Cl− > NO3− > PO43− for the cations and anions, respectively. The cluster analysis reveals that the sampling sites toward the human settlements are comparatively more polluted, indicating an anthropic signature that is also consistent with PCA results.

Historically, the ictalurid assemblage was characterized by five species of bullhead Ameiurus spp. and three species of madtom Noturus spp. Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus were introduced in the early 20th century, followed by Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris in 1965 and Blue Catfish Ictalurus furcatus in 1966. Long-term analysis of the ictalurid assemblage has been confounded by disparate data sets in both electronic and historical paper-based document archives. The goal of this study was to merge contemporary and legacy agency data sets to elucidate spatial and temporal trends in the ictalurid assemblage of the Cape Fear River basin. Rotenone surveys conducted in the 1960s documented abundant madtoms and White Catfish Ameiurus catus throughout the basin. Native species comprised the majority of the ictalurid assemblage through the early 1990s. Since 1990, Blue and Flathead catfish have been the dominant species observed. The largest native ictalurid, the White Catfish, has not been collected since 2008. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling suggests that native ictalurids were more prevalent in small tributaries with increasing distance from the initial adult Flathead Catfish stocking location. Despite the widespread distribution and abundance of nonnative ictalurids, several native species are still found in small tributaries in upstream watersheds. The North Carolina Catfish Management Plan prioritizes the conservation of native ictalurids in the state's Atlantic Slope rivers; however, some species may already be extirpated. © 2021 American Fisheries Society.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: K.T.

Statistical comparison of the organic and inorganic contents was performed using the paired t-tests, while the predominant socio-demographic profiles and health attributes of the respondents to flood-induced health risks (HI) were verified by the chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis. Among all, Fe, Cu, Pb, Ni, Zn, Cr, Cd, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, estriol, 17α-ethinylestradiol, estrone, β-estradiol and bisphenol A were detected at the study area after flooding. The microbiological quality of the floodwater samples has been tracked positive for Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri, with the mean concentrations of 6500, 50 and 180 CFU/100 mL, respectively. Exposure and health risk assessments revealed that the overall HI value for organic and inorganic contaminants in the water samples was 1.19, exceeding the USEPA maximum limit of 1, after the flood incidence. The largest CR contributors were Ni, Cr and Cd, while the infection risks (Pinf,single) associated with the exposure of E. coli, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were identified to be 3.1 × 10−2, 1.2 × 10−4 and 3.2 × 10−5 for incidental scenario; and 8.3 × 10−1, 3.9 × 10−1 and 1.9 × 10−1 for intentional scenario, respectively.

However, the non-point source pollution has posed a great threat to social and economic development in the cultivated land, due to a large number of chemical fertilizers and pesticides that have widely been used unreasonably during agricultural production in recent years. It is also very serious for the pollution of livestock and poultry breeding. Taking 21 county-level administrative units in part of Hunan Province in the Dongting Lake Plain as the research area, the inventory analysis was made to construct three types of pollution units for the farmland fertilizer, human and livestock excrement, as well as farmland solid wastes. Some parameters were calculated, including the total emission and intensity of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Nitrogen (TN), and Total Phosphorus (TP). The temporal and spatial evolution of non-point source pollution was determined in the cultivated land, further to analyze the movement trajectory of emission intensity barycenter and the degree of spatial agglomeration, using the center of gravity model and the cold/hot spot analysis. The results showed that: 1) There was a great decrease in the total emissions and emission intensity of COD, TN, and TP from the cultivated land non-point source pollution in the study area from 2005 to 2019. It was related to the promotion of ecological farming, soil testing formula technology, as well as the scale control of livestock and poultry breeding. There were also the spatial distribution characteristics of ""east>west>central"" in the pollution degree for three types of pollutants. 2) Three types of pollutants all moved in the longitude and latitude directions, but there was a more obvious in the east-west direction, where the barycenter of emission intensity presented a tendency to run westward. The adjustment and implementation of pollution prevention policies were attributed to the shift of the barycenter of the emission intensity in the three pollutants. 3) There were significant differences in the spatial patterns of the three pollutants. Specifically, the COD pollution was significantly different, TP was followed, and TN was the smallest in various regions. Hot spots were mostly distributed in the east of the Dongting Lake plain around the basin. The main reason was that these areas were on the edges of the intersection of the Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River, with advantageous location, rapid urbanization and industrialization, and stronger arable land utilization. The cold spots were mostly distributed in Nanxian and the surrounding areas in the middle of the Dongting Lake Plain. The concept of ecological civilization was contributed greatly to the distribution. As a result, much attention needs to pay to the treatment of non-point source pollution in the cultivated land and surrounding counties. Consequently, the non-point source pollution was improved in the cultivated land in the process of ecological civilization construction. There was also a great difference in the degree and control of cultivated land non-point source pollution in various regions. The finding can provide a sound theoretical basis to manage the non-point source pollution of cultivated land. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Based on their physiological properties and organization in tissues, lectins play some important roles. Lectins mediate protein-carbohydrate interactions; act as the chief constituent of innate immunity in invertebrates and vertebrates. Lectins can be useful for the analysis of structural and physiological features of cells, tissues, and harmful microbial pathogens. In agricultural sector, these lectin proteins are used as eco-friendly agents against insecticides. Lectins also play a major role from recognition of potential pathogens to complement-mediated opsonization and killing of the same by participating in several downstream effector functions. Over the last few decades, the key role of lectins as important regulators of mammalian adaptive immune responses has been identified. Fishes are bestowed with significant elements of mammalian adaptive responses and are furnished with several kinds of complex lectin repertoires. Fish lectins are highly diversified and show tissue-specific expression. The diversity of fish lectins are responsible to mediate numerous functions from cell-cell interactions, and also show some inhibitory effects against different types of bacteria, fungi, tumor cells, etc. Lectins also showed some proved biological properties like antiproliferative property of cancerous cells and mitogenic effects. Thus these proteins are hopeful drugs for the treatment of various human diseases.

E2 exposure evidently dampened fish locomotor activity, while BPA exposure had no marked effect. Interestingly, BPA-exposed fish reduced their aggressive behavior compared with control or E2. Both BPA and E2 exposure induced a significant decrease in group preference, as well as a weaker adaptability to new environment, exhibiting lower latency to reach the top, more entries to the top, longer time spent in the top, fewer frequent freezing, and fewer erratic movements. Furthermore, the circadian rhythmicity of light/dark preference was altered by either BPA or E2 exposure.

We describe three methods for relating fish reproductive success in reservoirs to hydrology; responses of young black bass (Micropterus spp.) in Bull Shoals Reservoir, Arkansas, are used as an example. Reproductive success was quantified as biomass (kg/ha) in two length-classes of young largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, sported bass M. punctulatus, and smallmouth bass M. dolomieu from 34 years of August cove rotenone samples. In the first method, we derived hydrology variables from inflow, release, volume, mean area, change in area, and selected ratios of inflow to release or release to volume from time segments ranging from one season to 2 years before fish sampling in August. This segmented-temporal approach produced 36 hydrology variables, many of which were intercorrelated. Biomass of small and intermediate length-classes of black bass were regressed on all hydrology variables in simple-linear regression and on subsets of independent hydrology variables in multiple-linear regression. Although time consuming, this approach usually provided the best-fitting and most easily interpreted predictive models. In the second method, biomass was regressed on variables derived from principal components analysis of 14 segmented-temporal variables. Four components explained 91% of the variation in hydrology variables, but only the first two components (explaining 82%) could be readily interpreted and were significant in regression models. This method was fast and avoided intercorrelations, but interpretation of third and fourth principal components was difficult, and the method did not produce the best-fit models. In the third method, we fit cosine functions to monthly discharge of the unregulated White River (1920-1949) and to end-of-month area of Bull Shoals Reservoir (1955-1993). We derived eight independent variables related to amplitude, phase, differences in the phase of the reservoir from the preproject river, and error in fit of the harmonic function to reservoir hydrology. This harmonic approach provided a good explanation of variations in surface area (r(2) = 0.84; N = 465) and in largemouth bass and spotted bass biomass; however, it did not yield predictive models that were significantly better than the principal components method. All three methods are potentially useful for quantifying effects of operations and hydrology on reservoir fish populations for multiple-use assessments of water resources.

Full-grown post-vitellogenic ovarian follicles were incubated in vitro with prochloraz, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), or a combination of prochloraz and LH. The occurrence of oocyte maturation was assessed by monitoring germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) after 62-h in vitro incubation. Experiments were repeated in presence of actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or trilostane. The effect of prochloraz on the production of 17,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta P), the natural maturation-inducing steroid, was quantified by radioimmunoassay. In addition, the effect of prochloraz on ovarian expression of 12 genes was monitored by real-time PCR. Prochloraz (10(-5)M) administered alone was able to induce 100% GVBD in the most responsive females. The occurrence of GVBD observed after prochloraz stimulation of follicles originating from various females was similar and highly correlated with the occurrence of GVBD observed after stimulation with low LH concentration. In addition, oocyte maturation induced by LH or prochloraz was totally inhibited by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and trilostane. Similarly to LH, prochloraz was able to trigger 17,20 beta P production by the ovarian follicle. Finally, prochloraz induced the overexpression of genes participating in 17,20 beta P production, intercellular communication, and paracrine control of preovulatory follicular differentiation such as igf, igf2, connexin 43, and 20 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (hsbd20). Together, our results demonstrate that prochloraz administered alone is able to trigger oocyte maturation through the induction of specific genes, some of them being also triggered by LH.

In general, experimental animals showed that atrazine and terbuthylazine exposure mostly affected their antioxidant defences and, to a lesser extent, lipid peroxidation, but the effects varied by the species, sex, age, herbicide concentration, and duration of exposure. Most of the studies involved aquatic organisms as useful and sensitive bio-indicators of environmental pollution and important part of the food chain. In laboratory mice and rats changes in oxidative stress markers were visible only with exposure to high doses of atrazine. Recently, our group reported that low-dose terbuthylazine could also induce oxidative stress in Wistar rats. It is evident that any experimental assessment of pesticide toxic effects should take into account a combination of several oxidative stress and antioxidant defence biomarkers in various tissues and cell compartments. The identified effects in experimental models should then be complemented and validated by epidemiological studies. This is important if we wish to understand the impact of pesticides on human health and to establish safe limits.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  34     Total Times Cited:  36     Cited Reference Count:  119,10.2478/aiht-2018-69-3118     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),atrazine;antioxidant enzymes;lipid peroxidation;terbuthylazine;CARP CYPRINUS-CARPIO;EARLY-LIFE STAGES;FRESH-WATER FISH;DNA-DAMAGE;SUBCHRONIC EXPOSURE;LIPID-PEROXIDATION;ATRAZINE EXPOSURE;HISTOPATHOLOGICAL CHANGES;ANTIOXIDANT ENZYMES;HERBICIDE ATRAZINE;Biological Markers;Oxidative Stress;Pesticides;Triazines,NA,NA,oxidative stress in triazine pesticide toxicity a review of the main biomarker findings
rayyan-1227192259,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance difenoconazole European Food Safety Authority,2011,1,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,9,1,,European Food Safety Authority,,English,,"EFSA, Parma, Italy","Difenoconazole is one of the 84 substances of the third stage part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002,(3) as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.(4)        Difenoconazole was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 January 2009 pursuant to Article 11b of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007 (hereinafter referred to as, the Regulation.). In accordance with Article 12a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as, the Commission.) in accordance with Article 12(1) of the Regulation. This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report.        Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on difenoconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 22 December 2006. The peer review was initiated on 6 March 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifier Syngenta Ltd. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that EFSA should conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology, environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on difenoconazole.        The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of difenoconazole as a fungicide on pome fruit, carrot, wheat, barley, triticale, rye and oats as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        No critical areas of concern were identified in the physical-chemical properties section. However, data gaps were identified for data to support the ranges of the cis/trans isomers in the technical specification, the biological activity of the isomers, the validation of the isomer method, the consequence for the physical-chemical properties of the active substance of the wide range of isomer content and the formulation's adhesion to seeds.        No critical areas of concern were identified in the mammalian toxicology section. Two data gaps were identified: for an assessment of the toxicological relevance of some impurities; and to clarify the uncertainties related to the isomer ratio of the tested compound (for which reference values have been derived), the isomer ratio to which the workers will be exposed and the relative toxicity of the different isomers.        Based on the metabolism studies conducted on four plant groups, the residue in plants was defined as difenoconazole for monitoring and provisionally as difenoconazole and TDM for risk assessment. Residue definitions were also proposed for animal products. No critical areas of concern were identified in the residue section. Data gaps were identified to provide information on the possible residues of TDM metabolites in primary crops, rotational crops, processed commodities and animal products. Additional residue trials and processing studies on carrots are also required. No acute or chronic intake concerns were identified for consumers, but this evaluation has to be considered provisional, since the contribution of the TDM metabolites and the isomeric composition of the residues were not taken into account.        The data available on environmental fate and behaviour were generally sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at the EU level for the representative uses assessed. The potential for groundwater contamination consequent to these uses by difenoconazole and the metabolites 1,2,4-triazole and CGA 205375 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was assessed as low. However, data gaps were identified for identification of the metabolites V3 and M4 formed in soil incubation, and for the rate of dissipation of difenoconazole in the field under Southern European conditions. The assessment of the environmental behaviour and consequent exposure levels of individual enantiomers of difenoconazole was not finalised.        Data gaps were identified in the ecotoxicology section. Further refinement of the risk to aquatic sediment-dwelling organisms for the use in cereals is necessary. Furthermore, the potential endocrine disruption effects in fish should be addressed. A data gap was also identified to demonstrate that the increase in body weight would not lead to adverse effects on earthworm populations in order to be able to use the reproduction NOEC from the reproduction study. Data gaps were identified to address the chronic risk to earthworms and Collembola. The possible impact on the ecotoxicity and the environment of potential enantio-selective biologically mediated metabolism/degradation or transformation needs to be addressed in order to the risk assessment for non-target organisms.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  10,10.2903/j.efsa.2011.1967     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Difenoconazole;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;fungicide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance difenoconazole european food safety authority

Currently, there is limited information on the effects of fipronil exposure in Japanese quail. Therefore, our aim was to assess the reproductive toxicological effects of fipronil in the Japanese quail in a 15-day gavage study and then its recovery over a period of 60 days. Fipronil-administration led to significant losses in both feed intake and body weight. Whereas, the gonadosomatic index was not affected, and histological changes observed in the testes were reversible, particularly by day 45 and day 60 of recovery. Cloacal gland atrophy, reduced foam quantity and a reduction in fertility, sexual and aggressive behaviors, and serum testosterone with elevated estradiol (E2) hormone levels were also observed. All these changes gradually reversed during various recovery periods. Further, alterations in hepatic vitellogenin (Vtg) and estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) gene expression, assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, were also observed. Specifically, ER alpha 1 was induced after fipronil administration, while the Vtg transcript was elevated during both exposure and recovery periods. Our results showed that fipronil exposure has a profound negative influence on reproductive traits in the male Japanese quail and exhibits an estrogenic activity that can raise the incidence of infertility in males. Nevertheless, most of the changes could be reversed after a recovery period of 30-45 days. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Animals acquire new skills due to conditioned responses resulting from a sequence of neutral and unconditioned stimuli affecting their bodies; there is a constant time interval between the stimuli. Both stimuli become associated after a number of repetitions and animal bodies start to respond to the initially neutral stimulus as to the unconditioned one. The aim of this study was to determine whether exposure of fish to a pyrethroid-deltamethrin (an active ingredient in Decis 2.5 EC pesticide that disturbs the proper operation of the nervous system) affects the ability to learn in common carp.        Materials and Methods. Production of new types of behaviour was triggered in fish by using the unconditioned stimulus (an irritating electric impulse) and the conditioned stimulus (light). The experiment was performed in a tank divided into two compartments where fish could swim freely from one compartment to another. The ability to learn was assessed on the basis of the following types of behaviour evoked in response to the conditioned stimulus: locomotor agitation, preference to occupy or avoid certain areas in the tank, an escape response, etc.        Results. In fish exposed to 0.35 mu g . L-1 deltamethrin (for common carp concentration 10 times lower than lethal) for 35 min the ability to produce and remember the conditioned defence response was reduced and time interval since presenting the conditioned stimulus till occurring the initial signs of the conditioned response was prolonged.

In estuaries, organisms are frequently submitted to stress caused by natural factors (e.g., continuous changes in salinity levels) and, additionally, to stress due to contamination. Therefore, the driving question of this study was: will organisms be more susceptible to suffer the deleterious effects caused by diazinon because of the stress resulting from the salinity changes? The estuarine shrimp Penaeus vannamei was used as the model organism and two responses were measured: osmoregulation (the physiological effect after a forced and continuous 24 h-exposure) and avoidance [the behavioural effect after a short (3 h) non-forced, multi-compartmented exposure]. Juveniles were exposed to diazinon (0.1, 1, 10 and 100 mu g/L) at three different salinities (10, 20 and 30). Disruption in the capacity to regulate the haemolymph osmotic pressure was observed at a salinity of 30 in individuals exposed to diazinon and methanol (used as vehicle). At that salinity, the ability of shrimps to detect and avoid the highest diazinon concentrations was impaired. P. vannamei juveniles inhabit environments with a high variation in salinity, but with an optimum osmotic point close to a salinity of 20; therefore, the higher the salinity, the greater the vulnerability of shrimps to the effects of diazinon. From an ecological point of view, this combined effect of salinity and contamination might also limit the spatial distribution of the organisms.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  74,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111364     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Costa Rica;Diazinon;Escape;Estuary;Non-forced exposure;Toxicity;Methanol;ORGANOPHOSPHORUS PESTICIDES;ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS;CARIDEAN SHRIMPS;RISK-ASSESSMENT;COSTA-RICA;TOXICITY;WATER;FISH;TEMPERATURE;ZEBRAFISH;Leg;Insecticides;European Continental Ancestry Group,NA,NA,the effect of the insecticide diazinon on the osmoregulation and the avoidance response of the white leg shrimp <i>penaeus vannamei<i> is salinity dependent

With these attributes, we propose the zebrafish is an excellent model for analyzing cognitive and neuromuscular responses when exposed to toxicants. Neurocognition can be readily analyzed using visual discrimination, memory and learning, and social behavior testing. Neuromuscular function can be analyzed using techniques such as the startle response, assessment of activity level, and evaluation of critical swimming speed. Furthermore, selectively mutated zebrafish is another novel application of this species in behavioral and pharmacological studies, which can be exploited in toxicological studies.

rayyan-1227192266,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bifenthrin,2009,4,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,4,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Bifenthrin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bifenthrin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 December 2005. The peer review was initiated on 01 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and on 12. May 2006 to the sole applicant, FMC Chemicals. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in February 2008. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying in cereals, grape and pome fruit for the control of a broad range of foliar pests, sucking and biting insects, mites, aphids. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Talstar 8 Sc"", a suspension concentrate(SC) containing 80 g/1 bifenthrin.        Since clarification is required with respect to the proposed maximum levels of certain impurities in the technical material, the specification as a whole should currently be regarded as provisional. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Adequate methods are available to monitor bifenthrin residues in food/feed of plant origin, soil and water, however data gaps were identified for residue methods in food/feed of animal origin air and body fluids and tissues.        As for mammalian toxicity, bifenthrin is ""Toxic if swallowed"" (R 25), it is toxic by inhalation (R 23 ""Toxic by inhalation"" proposed). Bifenthrin is a skin sensitiser (R43 ""May cause skin sensitisation by skin contact"" proposed). It is not a skin or eye irritant.        The main effect observed for repeated exposures is tremor and/or neurotoxic effects. The relevant short term toxicity NOAEL is 2.5 mg/kg bw/day in dogs whereas for long term exposures the NOAELs is 4.7 mg/kg bw/day in rats. Bifenthrin did not show any genotoxic potential. Due to the occurrence of bladder leiomyosarcomas/hemangiopericytomas in mice, as their relevance to humans could not be excluded and since the historical control data were not conclusive, R40 (Carc. Cat. 3) was proposed. In multigeneration studies the relevant maternal NOAEL is 3.0 mg/kg/day and the reproductive NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day, based on the occurrence of tremors and marginally lower body weight in the P and F1 generation females during gestation and lactation. Bifenthrin did not show any teratogenic potential (maternal NOAEL>7.4 mg/kg bw/day and developmental NOAEL >2 mg/kg bw/day). Bifenthrin did not show developmental neurotoxicity potential. The ADI is 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog studz with an SF 100, supported by the developmental study in rats. The ARfD is 0.03 mg/kg bw based on the 90-day neurotoxicity study with a SF 100. The AOEL is 0.0075 mg/kg bw/day (SF 100 and correction factor of 50% for limited oral absorption). The operator, worker and bystander exposure showed levels below the AOEL.        In metabolism studies on apples, cotton seed and corn plants bifenthrin was found to be the predominant residue. No significant cis-trans-isomerisation and translocation of residues through the plant were observed. Only for wheat/triticale and rye grown in Northern Europe sufficient residue trials have been submitted. Additional residue trial data are required to cover the notified use on n cereals in Northern and Southern Europe. On the basis of the available trials in cereals MRLs were only provisionally proposed. The representative uses in pome fruit and grapes are currently not supported by residue trials carried out according to the notified cGAP.        For the use on cereals no processing studies are required. The requirement of such studies for the uses on pome fruit and grapes has to be evaluated once sufficient data on residue trails are available.        Metabolism studies on rotational crops show that no significant residues are expected in parts of rotational crops intended for human consumption after application of bifenthrin on cereals according to the notified GAP.        Metabolism studies on lactating goats and laying hens show that metabolism, mainly by oxidation, cleavage of the ester binding and conjugation, is more extensive in some of the compartments. The experts meeting decided to include metabolites in the provisional residue definition for risk assessment for liver and kidney and eggs respectively. On the basis of provisional dietary burden calculations for intake of cereal and straw only, significant up-take of residues is only expected for cattle.        Taking into account the intake of cereals and of animal products only, consumer exposure is expected to be below the toxicological reference values. However, this risk assessment is only indicative and pending additional data for diverse areas of the residue section.        In soil under aerobic conditions bifenthrin exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the major soil metabolite TFP acid(2) (accounting for up to 11.6% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits moderate persistence and the minor non transient metabolite 4'-OH bifenthrin(3) (accounting for up to 8.3% AR) which exhibits low persistence. Mineralisation of both the cyclopropyl and phenyl rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 30-39% AR after 90 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink that accounted for 14-18 % AR after 90 days. Bifenthrin is immobile in soil, 4'-OH bifenthrin is expected to be immobile in soil though there is a data gap identified to confirm this and a data gap is identified for soil mobility data on TFP acid. There was no indication that adsorption of either bifenthrin or 4'-OH bifenthrin was pH dependent. TFP acid might be expected to exhibit pH dependent adsorption.        In dark natural sediment water systems bifenthrin degraded exhibiting high persistence in sediment to the metabolite 4'-OH bifenthrin in sediment (max 11.1% AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance from both the cyclopropyl and phenyl radiolabels accounting for a maximum of 3-27 % AR at 99 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues accounted for 6-14 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for bifenthrin at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4 for the applied for intended uses on cereals. For the metabolite 4'-OH bifenthrin, appropriate FOCUS step 2 sediment calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. A data gap was identified for PEC in surface water for the major soil metabolite TFP acid that may runoff or drain to surface water. There is also a data gap identified for a further runoff mitigation assessment with respect to bifenthrin in the FOCUS runoff scenarios.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses on cereals by bifenthrin and 4'-OH bifenthrin above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However for the metabolite TFP acid, data gaps are identified for the information required to further assess groundwater exposure potential. Contamination of groundwater above the 0.1 mu g/L limit by TFP acid might be expected in at least some, if not all FOCUS groundwater scenarios if all the necessary data to complete exposure simulations were available. Thus it is expected that a non relevance assessment will be necessary for TFP acid. Such an assessment that could be considered by the peer review is not available. Satisfactory environmental exposure assessments are not available for the applied for intended uses on grapes and pome fruit.        A low risk was indicated in the first-tier risks assessment for birds and mammals for all the evaluated uses except for the long-term risk to insectivorous birds and for the acute risk to mammals in orchards. A potential high long-term risk from the exposure of bifenthrin to mammals was identified for all the intended uses. A data gap was identified for the applicant to refine the long-term risk for mammals for all the intended uses. A new data gap was identified after the PRAPeR meeting by EFSA, for the applicant to refine the long-term risk to insectivorous birds and the acute risk to mammals in orchards. The risk of bifenthrin to earthworm-eating birds was considered to be low in cereals. A potential risk was identified for earthworm-eating mammals in cereals and a refinement of the risk was required. The risk assessment for fish eating birds and mammals should be re-estimated when the revised BCF would become available. The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals was however considered to be low.        The first tier risk assessment indicated a potential high acute and long-term risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The estimated TER values based on the FOCUS PECsw step 4 (20-25 m non-spray buffer zone) were below the Annex VI trigger values. Two higher tier studies were available to refine the assessment for invertebrates. From the mesocosm study a NOAEC of 0.015 mu g a.s./L was derived. It was proposed to apply an assessment factor of 3 to this value to cover variation in potential for recovery depending on the nature of the ecosystem. The higher tier risk assessment resulted in a TERit=3 based on the NOAEC from the mesocosm and initial FOCUS PECaw, Step 4 with 20 m no spray buffer zones in cereals. No safe use was identified for fish when applying the maximum 25m no spray-buffer zone. Due to the logP(OW) of 7.3 for bifenthrin the potential to bioconcentrate was considered to be high. The experts agreed that the potential for bifenthrin to accumulate in aquatic organisms needs to be further addressed. Two data gaps were identified during the experts meeting, The first one was for the submission of a refined risk assessment for fish and the second for the submission of the ecotoxicological studies with the TFP acid since there is the potential for exposure to this metabolite in water bodies associated with treated crops.        The experts concluded that a high risk was identified for bifenthrin to bees for all the evaluated uses. Risk mitigation measures were identified as being necessary. It could be concluded from the available information that there is a high risk to non-target arthropods (NTA) for in-field and off-filed areas within the treated area from the use in cereals. Risk mitigation measures are required to refine the risk to NTA in the off-field areas. A non-spray buffer zone of 5 m was identified as being necessary for cereals. A data gap was identified for the applicant to refine the risk to non-target arthropods. The acute risk assessment of bifenthrin and TFP acid to earthworms was assessed as low in cereals. However, the long-term risk to earthworms in cereals from exposure to both these compounds was considered to be potential high, and needed to be further addressed. A litterbag study (Walker H. 2005) was included in the dossier and this study did not show any effects of bifenthrin to the litter bag decomposition. Member State experts at the PRAPeR 52 meeting agreed that for pyrethroid compounds, the litter bag study does not cover the potential for there being a risk for soil macro organisms. A data gap was identified to the applicant to address the risk to non-target soil macro organisms. The risk to non-target plants needs to be addressed. The risk to micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for all the applied for representative uses evaluated.

This study was designed to examine the potential of L-137 on liver function, histopathology, immune and antioxidant related gene expressions in Nile tilapia exposed to subacute DLM for 30 days. Fish (mean weight of 28.18 +/- 1.34 g) was distributed into four groups (triplicates): the first and second groups fed the control diet, while the third and fourth groups fed L-137 at 50 mg/kg and the second and fourth groups were exposed to DLM (15 ig/L) in rearing water (control, DLM, L-137 and DLM + L-137, respectively).

rayyan-1227192272,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bifenthrin,2011,5,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,9,5,,European Food Safety Authority,,English,,"EFSA, Parma, Italy","Bifenthrin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023 as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the European Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the European Commission.        France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bifenthrin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 December 2005. The peer review was initiated on 1 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and on 12 May 2006 to the sole applicant FMC Chemicals. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in February 2008. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June -July 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 30 September 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 186).        Following the Commission Decision of 30 November 2009 (2009/887/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of bifenthrin in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant FMC Chemicals made a resubmission application for the inclusion of bifenthrin in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/125/08) as follows:        The fate and behaviour in soil and water, due to the possible presence of major soil metabolites, the relevance of which must be determined and, if necessary, further assessed. As a consequence, the risk to groundwater, could not be finalised;        The risk to aquatic organisms which, with the exception of invertebrates and algae, does not generate an acceptable use;        The risk to several species of mammals, non-target arthropods, non-target plants and nontarget soil macro-organisms.        and concerns were identified with regard to:        The risk to consumers, which may be underestimated, given the data gaps identified in the residue section, and the possible impact of the different isomers constituting bifenthrin;        The potential for contamination of groundwater by the major soil metabolite TFP acid;. The unacceptable high risk to aquatic vertebrates;        The long term risk to mammals;        The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm-eating mammals;        The risk from bioaccumulation through the aquatic food chain which is not finalised;        The risk to non-target arthropods (in-field), non-target plants and non-target soil macroorganisms which remains inconclusive.        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, France, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 6 August 2010.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 10 August 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 23 September 2010.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the European Commission requested the EFSA to deliver its conclusions on bifenthrin.        The conclusion of the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide, which comprise of foliar spraying in cereals, grape and pome fruit for the control of a broad range of foliar pests, sucking and biting insects, mites, aphids. Full details of the GAP can be found in Appendix A. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of bifenthrin as an insecticide on cereals, ornamentals and head cabbage, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Talstar 8 SC', a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 80 g/l bifenthrin.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Adequate methods are available to monitor bifenthrin residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin, in the environmental matrices and in body fluids and tissues.        As for mammalian toxicity, bifenthrin is ""Toxic if swallowed"" (R25), it is toxic by inhalation (R23 ""Toxic by inhalation"" proposed). Bifenthrin is a skin sensitiser (R43 ""May cause skin sensitisation by skin contact"" proposed). It is not a skin or eye irritant.        The main effect observed for repeated exposures is tremor and/or neurotoxic effects. The relevant short-term toxicity NOAEL is 2.5 mg/kg bw/day in dogs whereas for long-term exposures the NOAELs is 4.7 mg/kg bw/day in rats. Bifenthrin did not show any genotoxic potential. Due to the occurrence of bladder leiomyosarcomas/hemangiopericytomas in mice and as their relevance to humans could not be excluded, and the historical control data were not conclusive, R40 (Carc. Cat. 3) was proposed.        In multigeneration studies the relevant maternal NOAEL is 3.0 mg/kg bw/day and the reproductive NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day, based on the occurrence of tremors and marginally lower body weight in the P and F1 generation females during gestation and lactation. Bifenthrin did not show any teratogenic potential (maternal NOAEL> 7.4 mg/kg bw/day and developmental NOAEL >2 mg/kg bw/day). Bifenthrin did not show developmental neurotoxicity potential. The ADI is 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study with a SF of 100, supported by the developmental study in rats. The ARfD is 0.03 mg/kg bw based on the 90-day neurotoxicity study with a SF of 100. The AOEL is 0.0075 mg/kg bw/day (SF 100 and correction factor of 50% for limited oral absorption). The operator, worker and bystander exposure showed levels below the AOEL.        In the metabolism studies on apples (fruit crops), cotton seed (pulses and oilseeds) and maize plants (cereals) bifenthrin was found to be the predominant compound of the total residues. No significant cis-trans isomerisation and translocation of residues through the plant were observed. The proposed global residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment in plant commodities is bifenthrin (sum of isomers). Complete residue database were provided to support the representative uses on cereals (wheat, triticale, rye, barley and oat) for both Northern and Southern Europe and to propose MRLs while 4 additional residue trials are required on head cabbage (Northern Europe). The nature of the residues in processed commodities was sufficiently addressed for pasteurisation and baking, brewing and boiling but not for sterilisation. A data gap was identified to require a new hydrolysis study simulating the conditions of sterilisation to determine the nature of the residues in processed commodities. Based on the metabolism studies in ruminants and poultry, the proposed residue definition for monitoring for animal commodities is bifenthrin (sum of isomers). For risk assessment, the residue definition proposals are as follows:        -ruminant liver and kidney: sum of bifenthrin (sum of isomers) and BP-acid, expressed as bifenthrin (conversion factor of 2 for monitoring to risk assessment);        -eggs, poultry liver: sum of bifenthrin (sum of isomers) and hydroxyl-methyl bifenthrin and its fatty acid conjugates, expressed as bifenthrin (conversion factor of 2 for monitoring to risk assessment);        -for milk and all other animal products: bifenthrin (sum of isomers).        The storage time interval of the samples from the residue trials on cereals and head cabbage and of the animal tissues from the feeding studies can be considered as covered by the available storage stability data. Under normal agricultural practices, bifenthrin residue levels in the edible parts of the rotational crops intended for human consumption and as feed items are expected to be below 0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively. No chronic and acute intake concerns were identified according to EFSA PRIMo rev. 2A model. The consumer risk assessment should be regarded as provisional pending the submission of the additional residue trials on head cabbage. The potential for a different degradation of bifenthrin enantiomers in plant and animal commodities was considered as sufficiently addressed since the S/R enantiomeric ratio of the parent bifenthrin was shown to remain unchanged (S/R ratio: 1/1) both in cereals and head cabbage samples from the residue trials and in fat samples from the rat. Based on the available residue datasets an MRL of 0.05 mg/kg is proposed for wheat, triticale and rye grain and a MRL of 0.1 mg/kg is set for barley and oat grain. A provisional MRL of 0.3 mg/kg is proposed for head cabbage. MRLs were also defined for animal matrices.        In soil under aerobic conditions bifenthrin exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the major soil metabolite TFP acid (accounting for up to 11.6% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence and the minor non-transient metabolite 4'-OH bifenthrin (accounting for up to 8.3% AR) which exhibits moderate persistence. Mineralisation of both the cyclopropyl and phenyl rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 30-39% AR after 90 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink that accounted for 14-18 % AR after 90 days. Bifenthrin is immobile in soil, 4'-OH bifenthrin is expected to be immobile in soil though there was a data gap identified to confirm this. Metabolite TFP acid exhibited very high to medium mobility. There was no indication that adsorption of either bifenthrin or 4'-OH bifenthrin was pH dependent, whereas TFP acid exhibited pH dependent adsorption.        In dark natural sediment water systems bifenthrin degraded exhibiting high persistence in sediment to the metabolite 4'-OH bifenthrin in sediment (max. 11.1% AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance from both the cyclopropyl and phenyl radiolabels accounting for a maximum of 3-27 % AR at 99 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues accounted for 6-14 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for bifenthrin at steps 1-4, with spray drift and run-off mitigation being applied at step 4 for the applied for representative uses on cereals and head cabbage. For the metabolite TFP acid and additionally for the 4'-OH bifenthrin, appropriate FOCUS step 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. Regarding the outdoor uses on ornamentals, a data gap was identified for exposure estimations for surface water and sediment.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses on cereals and head cabbage by bifenthrin, TFP acid and 4'-OH bifenthrin above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by the relevant FOCUS groundwater scenarios. The potential for groundwater exposure from the uses on ornamentals was accepted to be covered by the estimations available for cereals.        Since bifenthrin and its two metabolites relevant for the environment consist of 2 enantiomers and because only limited information on the behaviour of the enantiomers of bifenthrin in the environment was available, a data gap regarding this issue remained.        Low acute, short-term and long-term risks were indicated with the first-tier risk assessment for birds and a low acute risk was indicated for mammals for the outdoor representative uses. A potential high long-term risk to mammals was identified with the first tier for outdoor representative uses; however, the risk was assessed as low with a subsequent assessment based on the Guidance Document on Birds and Mammals (EFSA, 2009). The risk of bifenthrin to earthworm-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low for the outdoor representative uses, based on PECsoil plateau of 0.027 mg/kg. The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals was considered to be low based on the BCF value for fish of 1709.        Since bifenthrin has a potential for biomagnification i.e. potential for accumulation observed in a metabolism study on rat and estimated biomagnification factor (BAF)>1, a food chain modelling has been carried out. However, the experts at the PRAPeR 87 experts' meeting identified several uncertainties in the model assumptions and parameterization and therefore they concluded that a high risk from biomagnification in the terrestrial food chain cannot be excluded. Therefore the experts agreed to identify a data gap for the applicant to further address this risk.        The risk to birds and mammals for the indoor representative use in ornamentals is low since no exposure is expected.        The first tier risk assessment indicated a potential high acute and long-term risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The estimated TER values, based on the FOCUS PECsw step 4 (20-25 m no-spray buffer zones and run-off reduction) and higher tier toxicity end points, were above the Annex VI trigger values indicating a low risk. To fulfil the data gap identified during the PRAPeR 53 to further address the risk from bioaccumulation through the food chain, a biomagnification modelling has been carried out and provided in the Additional Report. This modelling has been discussed at the PRAPeR 87. The experts agreed that a high risk from bioaccumulation through the food chain for aquatic organisms could not be excluded on the basis of the available data. Therefore, a data gap was identified to further address the risk from biomagnification in the aquatic food chain and to address the uncertainties raised.        The experts concluded that a high risk was identified for bifenthrin to bees for all the outdoor representative uses. Risk mitigation measures should be applied to avoid the exposure of bees and effects from residual toxicity (by considering an appropriate interval between the last application and flowering).        It could be concluded from the available information that there is a high risk to non-target arthropods for in-field and off-field areas within the treated area from the outdoor representative uses. Risk mitigation measures are required to reduce the exposure of non-target arthropods in the off-field areas. A data gap was identified for the applicant to provide further data to address the residual toxicity of bifenthrin to non-target arthropods and the potential for recovery/recolonisation.        The acute and long-term risk of bifenthrin and TFP acid to earthworms was assessed as low.        The risk to soil macro-organisms, micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for all the representative uses evaluated.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  17,10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2159     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),bifenthrin;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;insecticide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bifenthrin

As polluted ecosystems may simultaneously present other multiple natural stressors, the objective of the present study was to evaluate joint effect of stressors (natural and anthropogenic) on life history traits of the Neotropical cladoceran, Ceriodaphnia silvestrii. For this purpose, the effects of water conditioned with predator kairomones (fish) and environmental concentrations (sublethal) of two pesticides widely used in sugarcane monoculture in Brazil, the insecticide Regent(R)800 WG (active ingredient-a.i. fipronil) and the herbicide DMA(R)806 BR (a.i. 2,4-D) were evaluated using chronic toxicity testing, isolated and in mixture, for this cladoceran species. The environmental risks of pesticides for tropical freshwater biota were also estimated from the risk quotient MEC/PNEC. Among the characteristics of the life history of C. silvestrii evaluated after 8 days of exposure, compared with the mean value of control, the age of primiparous females was not affected by any evaluated treatment. However, species average survival decreased in the treatment of kairomones mixed with fipronil (FK) and in the treatment with a mixture of fipronil, 2,4-D, and kairomones (MFKD). The body length of maternal females was shorter than in the control after exposure in treatments with only kairomones (K) and FK. Fecundity of this cladoceran was reduced when exposed to FK and MFKD treatments, and the intrinsic rate of population increase significantly decreased for organisms exposed to treatment with fipronil (F) and to mixtures of fipronil and 2,4-D (MFD), MFDK, and FK. The results indicated that the combination of anthropogenic and natural stressors causes changes inC. silvestriilife history traits, which can contribute to the decline in populations, and our preliminary risk assessment results are a matter of concern regarding biota conservation.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  70,10.1007/s00244-020-00754-7,"ACUTE TOXICITY TESTS;DAPHNIA-MAGNA;2,4-DICHLOROPHENOXYACETIC ACID;PESTICIDES;PLASTICITY;REPRODUCTION;UNCERTAINTY;HERBICIDES;DEFENSES;BEHAVIOR;Prednisolone",NA,NA,lifehistory traits response to effects of fish predation kairomones fipronil and 24d on neotropical cladoceran<i>ceriodaphnia silvestrii<i>

Overall, our data suggest that galectin-9 plays a pivotal role in the immune system of P. major. The findings of this study can potentially serve as a reference for understanding the function of galectin-9 in the P. major immune system; moreover, galectin-9 has been identified as a potential candidate for use as a disease-related molecular marker.        Galectin (Gal) is a member of a family of beta-galactoside-binding lectin. The members of this family play important roles in the recognition of carbohydrate ligands and in various other biological processes. In this study, we identified the gene encoding Gal-9 in Pagrus major (PmGal-9) and analyzed its expression in various tissues after pathogen challenge. Alignment analysis revealed that the two galactose-binding lectin domains of the deduced protein were highly conserved among all the teleosts. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PmGal-9 is most closely related to the Gal-9 gene of gilthead sea bream. PmGal-9 was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues analyzed but was predominantly expressed in the spleen, head kidney, and intestine. After challenges with major microbial pathogens (Edwardsiella piscicida, Streptococcus iniae, or red sea bream iridovirus) of red sea bream, PmGal-9 mRNA expression was significantly regulated in most immune-related tissues. These results suggested that PmGal-9 not only plays an important role in the immune system of red sea bream but is also a possible inflammatory marker for pathogenic diseases.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  48,10.3390/ani11010139     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"aquaculture;gene profiling;Streptococcus iniae;Edwardsiella piscicida;iridovirus;RNA, Messenger",NA,NA,molecular identification and mrna expression profiles of galectin9 gene in red sea bream <i>pagrus major<i> infected with pathogens

Usually, one miRNA may regulate many genes as its targets, while one gene may also be targeted by many miRNAs. We previously demonstrated that cyb561d2, whose protein product is involved in cell defense, and chemical stress, is targeted by miR-155 in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) when exposed to fipronil (5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl) sulphinyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile). Microcosm Targets prediction showed that the cyb561d2 gene is also highly possibly targeted by miR194a, miR-216b, miR-429, and miR-499. These interactions need to be further validated experimentally. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fipronil on miR-194a, miR-216b, miR-429, miR-499 and cyb561d2 in zebrafish and investigated whether these four miRNAs could regulate the expression of cyb561d2 in both mRNA and protein levels. The expression of cyb561d2 was upregulated in both mRNA and protein level in a dose-dependent manner upon stimulation of fipronil, and miR-216b and miR-499 were downregulated concurrently, whereas there was no significant changes were observed in the expression level of miR194a and miR-429. The dual luciferase report assay demonstrated that miR-216b and miR-499 interacted with cyb561d2 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR), miR-194a and miR-429 did not stimulate degradation of cyb561d2 mRNA. The expression of cyb561d2 was reduced in both mRNA and protein level when ZF4 cells were transfected with miR-499 mimic, whereas expression level of both mRNA and protein was increased when endogenous miR-499 was inhibited by transfection with miR-499 inhibitor. Likewise, the mRNA and protein level of cyb561d2 was affected by treatment with the mimics and the inhibitor of miR-216b. In contrast, when ZF4 cells were transfected with a mimic of miR-194a or miR-429, the expression of cyb561d2 mRNA was not significantly changed. As a result, cyb561d2 is targeted by miR-155, miR-216b and miR-499 upon fipronil exposure, and miR-194a and miR-429 can not target cyb561d2. The expression pattern of these 3 miRNAs presents novel fipronil responses that could be used as a toxicological biomarker. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Teleost-specific Gstr1 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) was previously shown to have high expression in toxicologically relevant tissues and high activity towards model substrates. The aim of this study was a detailed functional characterization of zebrafish Gstr1. Molecular docking analyses were used to get novel insight into structural characteristics of Gstr1 and elucidation of the mechanistic interactions with both GSH and various Gstr1 substrates or inhibitors. An initial screening inhibition assay performed using model fluorescence substrate monochlorobimane (MCB) revealed interactions of different endogenous compounds and environmentally relevant xenobiotics with zebrafish Gstr1. All interacting compounds were further analyzed to determine their inhibition type and K-i values. Our data revealed that pregnenolone, progesterone, testosterone, DHEAS and corticosterone competitively inhibited transformation of MCB by Gstr1 with the calculated K-i values in the range 14-26 mu M, implying that these hormones are physiological substrates of zebrafish Gstr1. Estrogens had no effect on Gstr1 activity. Taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC) expressed lower inhibition potency toward Gstr1 with the K-i value of 33 mu M. Among tested xenobiotics tributyltin chloride and rifampicin non-enzymatically bound Gstr1 enzyme (the calculated K-i values are 0.26 mu M and 65 mu M, respectively) and inhibited its activity, showing that these compounds are reversible noncompetitive inhibitors of zebrafish Gstr1. Insecticide diazinon competitively inhibited Gstr1 activity with calculated K-i value of 27 mu M, while other Gstr1-interacting insecticides, chlorpyrifos-methyl (CPF-methyl) and malathion, showed allosteric activation like effect. Among tested pharmaceuticals, tetracycline, erythromycin and methotrexate demonstrated competitive type of inhibition with the calculated K-i values of 17.5, 36.5 and 29 mu M, respectively. In summary, we suggest that zebrafish Gstr1 has an important role in steroidogenesis, metabolism and/or physiological actions of androgens, but not estrogens in fish. Finally, our results imply the role of Gstr1 in metabolism of xenobiotics and protection of fish against deleterious environmental contaminants such as organophosphate insecticides and pharmaceuticals.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  72,10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.01.005     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Glutathione-S-transferase r1;Zebrafish;Molecular docking;Functional characterization;Interaction screening;Endogenous compounds;Xenobiotics;ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSE SYSTEM;PROTEIN-LIGAND INTERACTIONS;OXIDATIVE STRESS;LIPID-PEROXIDATION;SCORING FUNCTION;COMMON CARP;EXPRESSION;TRIBUTYLTIN;BINDING;GENES;Glutathione Transferase,NA,NA,molecular characterization of zebrafish gstr1 the only member of teleostspecific glutathione s transferase class

Ubiquitous, persistent, and substantial uses of Harness((R)) in agricultural processes have resulted in the pollution of nearby water sources, posing a threat to various aquatic biotas, including fish. The effects of Harness((R)) toxicity on fish health are little known. So, this study aimed to describe the impact of herbicide Harness((R)) on the oxidative stress and reproductive and thyroid performance of male and female tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and also investigate the prospective role of the natural antioxidant lycopene supplementation in dismissing the adverse properties of Harness((R)). Antioxidant enzyme (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and total antioxidant capacity) and hormone measurements (T, E2, T3, and T4) were carried out, and gonadal and thyroid follicle histological sections were examined as a method to investigate the effects of Harness((R)) toxicity on fish. Male and female tilapia were exposed to 10 mu mol/L and 100 mu mol/L of Harness((R)) and treated with 10 mg lycopene/kg for 15 days of exposure. Our results demonstrated that the antioxidant enzyme activity was altered by Harness exposure and serum T for both males and females dropped; also, female E2 levels decreased, but male E2 increased. Exposure to higher dose of Harness((R)) induced elevation in both T3 and T4 levels, although the low exposure dose stimulated T4 levels. Harness((R)) exposure prompted histological variations and degenerative changes in testicular, ovarian, and thyroid follicle tissues. Lycopene supplement administration diminished oxidative stress induced by Harness((R)), alleviating its endocrine disparaging effects by neutralizing T3, T4, T, and E2 and ameliorating the histological structure of gonadal and thyroid tissues. In conclusion, lycopene supplementation was preformed to normalize the alterations and oxidative damage caused by Harness((R)) in Nile tilapia, suggesting that lycopene-supplemented diet functioned as potent antioxidants and had the ability to alleviate oxidative stress and thyroid and reproductive toxicity caused by herbicide Harness((R)).

While O. mossambicus are now not commonly used as an aquaculture species, the biological traits that made them a popular culture species including tolerance to wide ranging ecological conditions, generalist dietary requirements and rapid reproduction with maternal care have also made them a 'model' invader. Self-sustaining populations now exist in almost every region to which they have been imported. In Australia, since their introduction in the 1970s, O. mossambicus have become established in catchments along the east and west coasts and have the potential to colonise other adjacent drainages. It is thought that intentional translocations are likely to be the most significant factor in their spread in Australia. The ecological and physical tolerances and preferences, reproductive behaviour, hybridization and the high degree of plasticity in the life history traits of O. mossambicus are reviewed.

In all species, total concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) attained the highest concentration of the OC compounds quantified in both study years. DDT and metabolites attained the second highest concentration of OC compounds, in those species in which these compounds were quantified, followed by chlordane and its constituents and dieldrin, respectively.

In 1990 lake trout again had the highest concentration of OCs followed by chinook salmon, brown trout, rainbow trout, and coho salmon. Brook trout were not in the analysis. Chinook salmon contributed the greatest proportion of OCs to the 1985 sport catch because of its dominance in total biomass of fish harvested. Lake trout contributed the greatest proportion of OCs to the 1990 sport catch, although the second highest in biomass harvested, because of the higher concentration of OC compounds in this species.

Eels exposed to the pesticide were grouped in 24-h intervals according to their time of death, while surviving intoxicated eels constituted another group (live animals). Glutathione content (GSx, GSH, GSSG) was determined in liver and muscle tissues of the dead and live (intoxicated) animals and compared to control values (nonexposed eels). The fish that died before 96 h of exposure were considered susceptible to thiobencarb, while those dead after 96 h and the surviving ones were called resistant. Hepatic glutathione (GSH) content in susceptible eels was lower than that in the control fish, while resistant eels presented GSH levels threefold higher than those of controls. Muscle glutathione levels in dead eels mere practically unaffected, but there was a significant decrease in GSH levels in the surviving intoxicated eels. These results indicate that the eels that were able to induce glutathione synthesis in the liver due to the presence of thiobencarb in the medium demonstrated a greater longevity than those who lost glutathione homeostasis.

rayyan-1227192292,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Acetochlor,2008,10,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,10,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Acetochlor is one of the 79 substances of the third stage, part A, of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on acetochlor in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 4 April 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 14 December 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant Task Force consisting of Dow AgroSciences and Monsanto Europe S.A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in August September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 27 September 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on maize, for full details of the GAP please refer to the attached end points.        The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""GF-675"" and ""Mon 69447"" a 400 g/L capsule suspension (CS) and a 840 g/L emulsifiable concentrate (EC).        The residue definition for monitoring in plants has not been concluded on. Acetochlor residues in maize can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For Noxamic acid metabolite 68(2) a LC-MS/MS method is available this metabolite can not be analysed by a multi method. For products of animal origin there are no methods available. At this stage it can not be concluded if this is a data gap or not as the assessment for residues is not complete.        For soil a LC-MS/MS method is available that analyses for acetochlor, t-oxanilic acid (2)3, t-sulfonic acid (7) (4), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3) (5), s-sulfonic acid (13)(6) and t-norchloroacetochlor (6) (7). For surface/ground/drinking water LC-MS/MS methods are available for acetochlor, t-oxanilic acid (2), tsulfonic acid (7), s-sulfonic acid (13) t-norchloroacetochlor (6) and t-sulfinylacetic acid (3). In addition to this there is also a LC-MS/MS method for t-norchloroacetochlor (6) in drinking water. Air can be analysed for acetochlor by LC-MS/MS.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. However, it should be noted that there are no spectra, analytical methods or storage stability data for the relevant impurities in the technical material.        Acetochlor has a moderate acute toxicity. The proposed classification is Xn, R20/22 Harmful by inhalation and if swallowed; Xi, R37/38 Irritating to respiratory system and skin; R43 May cause sensitisation by skin contact. In short term studies the dog was the most sensitive species showing decreased body weight gain and histopathological findings in kidneys and testes. Many in vitro genotoxicity studies showed positive results but the in vivo tests did not indicate clearly a mutagenic potential. In long term studies different types of tumours were observed with increased incidences and the classification Carc. cat.3, R40 Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect was proposed. No specific effect on the reproductive parameters was found in multigeneration studies with rats, and no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits. The groundwater metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3), t-sulfonic acid (7) and ssulfonic acid (13) were considered relevant taking into account the limited information available and the carcinogenic potential of the parent compound. The relative toxicity of the plant and potential surface water metabolite t-norchloro acetochlor (6) in comparison with acetochlor could not be concluded.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.0036 mg/kg bw/day using the LOAEL from the 78-week mouse study with a safety factor of 300. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study, with the use of a safety factor of 100. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 1.5 mg/kg bw, derived from the acute rat neurotoxicity study with the application of a safety factor of 100. Two representative formulations were considered in the exposure assessment. For GF-675, the operator exposure is below the AOEL with the use of gloves. For MON 69447, the estimates with the German and UK models are above the AOEL but a biomonitoring study measured exposures below the AOEL with the use of closed cabins and gloves.        Metabolism of acetochlor was studied in maize plants upon a pre-emergence treatment. Total residues in the mature grain were low and did not permit an extensive identification of metabolites. The rate of identification in other maize plant parts was limited and the need for further data was identified, in particular with regard to the nature of the residue in plant parts fed to livestock and in immature maize kernels (sweet corn use withdrawn during the peer review). Also early-post emergence uses are currently not sufficiently addressed by metabolism data. Based on the available data a number of metabolites were identified and some of them are considered toxicological relevant (potential carcinogenicity). Therefore the residue definition was extensively discussed and it was concluded that for risk assessment all compounds forming EMA (34)8 and HEMA (33)(9) on hydrolysis as well as hydroxy-oxamic acid (68), all expressed as acetochlor should be considered for maize grain and preliminary also for rotational crops (the latter restricted to cereal grains, root and tuber crops and leafy crops). The need for further rotational crop data was identified. For monitoring purposes three options for a residue definition were proposed, and risk management consideration is required to decide on the final monitoring definition. Residue trials confirmed that residues in maize kernels, when analysed for the risk assessment residue definition, are below the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.05 mg/kg. However, currently insufficient data in terms of quality and magnitude of residues are available to assess the dietary burden of livestock. Consumer exposure estimates therefore only include the exposure from maize grain but don't consider potential exposure from food of animal origin and certain rotational crops. Therefore the consumer risk assessment should be considered as not finalised. It is also noted that there is potential consumer exposure to acotochlor metabolites from ground water used as drinking water, in particular to t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinyl acetic acid (3), t-sulfonic acid (7) and s-sulfonic acid (13). A risk assessment showed that the ADI of acetochlor, when applied to the metabolites, might be exceeded only due to the consumption of water containing these metabolites at the level estimated in FOCUS scenarios.        In topsoil under aerobic conditions acetochlor exhibits low to moderate persistence forming the major soil metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2) (max 17 % applied radioactivity (AR)) and t-sulfonic acid (7) (max 11.8%AR) which exhibited moderate to high persistence and t-sulfinylacetic acid (3) (max 18%AR) which exhibited medium to high persistence. The minor soil metabolites s-sulfonic acid (13) (max 9.8%AR) which exhibited moderate to medium persistence and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) (max 3.3%AR) were also identified. Mineralisation of the phenyl radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted only 0.3-3.1 % of applied radioactivity (AR) after 96 days. The formation of unextractable residues was also a significant sink accounting for 15-41 % AR after 84-90 days. Acetochlor exhibits high to medium mobility in soil. t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinyl acetic acid (3) and t-sulfonic acid (7) exhibit very high to high mobility in soil and s-sulfonic acid (13) exhibits very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either acetochlor or these 4 metabolites was pH dependant.        In natural sediment water systems acetochlor exhibited moderate persistence degrading to the major metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2) (max. 13.1%AR in water) and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) (max 10.4%AR in water 19.2%AR in sediment). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for only 1.4-2.7 % AR at 100 days. Unextracted sediment residues were the most significant sink for radioactivity representing 24-50 % AR at 100 days. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for acetochlor at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1p.g/L by parent acetochlor was concluded to be low, in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. A high potential for groundwater contamination >0.1 mu g/L over significant areas of the EU by the metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3), t-sulfonic acid (7) and s-sulfonic acid (13) that have (on the basis of the available mammalian toxicology data) been concluded as relevant metabolites was identified. It was considered that a lysimeter study would be essential to exclude the potential for the presence of additional metabolites in groundwater.        The short-term TER for birds and the acute and long-term TERs for mammals were above the trigger of 10 and 5 in the first-tier risk assessment. A residue decline study was submitted. The acute risk to herbivorous birds was sufficiently addressed on the basis of measured residues. However it was not possible to conclude on the reliability of the suggested PD and PT values to refine the long-term risk to herbivorous birds since no summaries of the supporting studies were made available. The refined risk assessment for insectivorous birds based on crested lark (Galerida cristata) was agreed by the meeting. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water was assessed as low for mammals. The risk assessment for uptake of contaminated drinking water was discussed in the expert meeting. It was agreed that the risk to mammals is low. However a high acute risk cannot be excluded for birds for post-emergence applications where accumulation of water in leaf axils of maize plants can occur. The risk from secondary poisoning of fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low in the first tier but further refinement was required for earthworm-eating birds and mammals. The risk was sufficiently addressed using data from a bioconcentration study with earthworms. The risk from soil metabolites was considered to be low because their log Pow is <3 suggesting a low potential of bioconcentration and bioaccumulation in the food chain. Endpoints from acute toxicity studies with rats were available for the major plant metabolite 68 (N-(6-ethyl-3-hydroxy-2-methylphenyl) and for metabolite 3 (t-sulfonylacetic acid). No information on the toxicity to birds was available. In the risk assessment it was assumed that the metabolites have a similar toxicity to birds as the parent. The acute and long-term TERs for birds and mammals were above the triggers of 10 and 5. However some uncertainty remains because of the high proportion of not identified residues in the residue trials (up to 39% of TRR) and one of the unknown compounds exceeded the threshold of 10% of TRR. Acetochlor is very toxic to all groups of aquatic organisms and a high risk was indicated in the risk assessment with FOCUS step3 PECsw. A risk refinement based on endpoints from a static mesocosm and from a mesocosm with a pulsed exposure regime was used to refine the risk in lentic and lotic waterbodies. The experts agreed that the NOAEC of 0.2 lag acetochlor/L for lentic water bodies and the NOAEC of 2 mu g acetochlor/L for lotic waterbodies should be used in the risk assessment together with an assessment factor of 2-3. A new risk assessment was prepared by the RMS in addendum 5 (not peer-reviewed) taking into account the recommendations of the expert meeting. The TERs were below the trigger of 2 for all FOCUS step 3 scenarios. In addendum 6 (not peer-reviewed) TERs were calculated for no-spray buffer zones of 25 and 50m. No full scenario resulted in TERs >2 with a no spray buffer zone of 25m. TERs >= 2 were observed in two full scenarios (D4, D5) out of 8 scenarios if a no-spray buffer zone of 50m is applied but no full scenario achieved TERs >= 3. Overall it is concluded that the risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to acetochlor is high for the representative uses evaluated. The risk from metabolites in water and sediment was assessed as low. The bioconcentration potential of acetochlor was assessed as low.        A high in-field risk was identified for both indicator species for the representative uses with the lead formulation GF-675. Extended laboratory studies indicated a low risk to Aphidius rhopalosiphi but the LD50 for Typhlodromus pyri was below the suggested application rate. However the trigger is met for the off-field area and considering the short half life of acetochlor on vegetation it was considered as likely that recolonisation is possible. In addition no mortality was observed in the standard laboratory tests with the leaf dwelling species C. carnea at dose rates of 2000 g a.s./ha. Therefore it was concluded in the expert meeting that the risk to leaf dwelling arthropods is low. The risk to soil surface dwelling arthropods from exposure to acetochlor and its soil metabolites was considered to be low.        The acute risk of acetochlor to earthworms was assessed as low. No long-term risk assessment is triggered because the representative uses cover only one application per year and the field DT90 is <100 days. The acute and long-term risk from soil metabolites to earthworms was assessed as low.        A high risk to non-target terrestrial plants was identified and risk mitigation measures such as a 5m in-field no spray buffer zone are required.        The risk to bees, earthworms, soil-micro organisms, organic matter breakdown and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses of acetochlor.

Separated from other neurotoxins, ROT induces a Parkinson's disease (PD)-related phenotype that mimics the associated clinical spectrum by directly entering the central nervous system (CNS). It easily crosses through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in mitochondria. Unfortunately, most of the existing data focus on locomotion. This is why the present study aimed to bring novel evidence on how ROT alone or in combination with different potential ant(agonists) might influence the social and aggressive behavior using the counterclockwise rotation as a neurological pointer. Material and Methods: Thus, we exposed zebrafish to ROT-2.5 mu g/L, valproic acid (VPA)-0.5 mg/mL, anti-parkinsonian drugs (LEV/CARB)-250 mg + 25 mg, and probiotics (PROBIO)-3 g for 32 days by assessing the anti-social profile and mirror tests and counterclockwise rotation every 4 days to avoid chronic stress. Results: We observed an abnormal pattern in the counterclockwise rotation only in the (a) CONTROL, (c) LEV/CARB, and (d) PROBIO groups, from both the top and side views, this indicating a reaction to medication and supplements administered or a normal intrinsic feature due to high levels of stress/anxiety (p < 0.05). Four out of eight studied groups-(b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, (e) ROT, and (f) ROT + VPA-displayed an impaired, often antithetical behavior demonstrated by long periods of time on distinct days spent on the right and the central arm (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.0005). Interestingly, groups (d) PROBIO, (g) ROT + LEV/CARB, and (h) ROT + PROBIO registered fluctuations but not significant ones in contrast with the above groups (p > 0.05).

Cadmium (Cd) is a genotoxic heavy metal that has been recognized as a human carcinogen. Oxidant stress and inhibition of DNA repair have been proposed as major factors underlying Cd genotoxicity. Our previous studies indicated the ability of Cd to disturb the gene expression of MSH6 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. This study was undertaken to explore if Cd-induced oxidative stress down-regulated MSH gene activities. Following the exposure of zebrafish embryos at 1 h post fertilization (hpf) to sublethal concentrations of Cd at 3-5 mu M for 4 or 9 h, a parallel down-regulation of MSH2, MSH6 and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) gene expression was detected by real-time RT-PCR and the expression levels were 40-50% of control after a 9-h exposure. Cd exposure also induced oxidative stress, yet no inhibition of catalase gene activity was observed. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed a wide distribution of msh6 mRNA in the head regions of 10 hpf embryos and pretreatment of embryos with antioxidants butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), D-mannitol or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at 1-10 mu M restored Cd-suppressed msh6 expression. QPCR confirmed the protective effects of antioxidants on Cd-suppressed msh2/msh6 mRNA production. Down-regulated MSH gene activities reaching about 50% of control were also induced in embryos exposed to paraquat, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating herbicide, or hydrogen peroxide at 200 M. Hence, Cd at sublethal levels down-regulates msh2/msh6 expression primarily via ROS as signaling molecules. The transcriptional activation of human msh6 is known to be fully dependent on the specificity factor 1 (Spl). Cd failed to inhibit the DNA binding activity of zebrafish Spl unless at lethal concentrations based on band shift assay, therefore excluding the involvement of Spl inactivation in Cd-induced MSH gene inhibition in zebrafish embryos. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted laboratory experiments to test selective predation by two species of larval dytiscid beetles (Agabus; Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) and the potential contribution of these beetles to suppression of mosquito populations in constructed wetlands.        2. Agabus consumed copepods, ostracods and mosquito larvae in no-choice tests. When offered a choice, 76% of all prey consumed were mosquito larvae, indicating selective predation. Subsequent experiments revealed this preference was due to ease of capture of mosquito larvae over alternative prey.        3. Cannibalism and intraguild predation were common within and between species of Agabus, which may reduce the overall impact of the observed selective predation.        4. Agabus larvae selectively preyed on mosquito larvae over alternative prey, which is not characteristic of some fish used as biological control agents for mosquitoes. Predator exclusion or similar experiments in the field could document how these results translate into a natural setting.        5.

Juveniles stage of C. gariepinus were used for the toxicity study. Lethal concentration of 50% mortality of sample (LC50) was determined using semi-static method. From the result of the LC50 determination lower concentrations of endosulfan were prepared for sub-lethal test. Ten fish per test concentration in three replicates were exposed to varying concentrations of endosulfan (0.00, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075 and 0.01) mu g/L. Signs of stress and mortality were monitored during the experimental duration. Cortisol levels, GST and AChE activities were measured spectrophotometrically. No visible changes in behaviour and appearance were observed in the treated fishes and no mortality recorded. Significant (p < 0.05) declined in cortisol secretion was observed and the change in the concentration was dose and time dependent. Glutathione S-transferase activity was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the control and the concentrations increase with increased in concentration and exposure duration. No clear trend was observed in acetylcholinesterase activity.

Defensive behaviors were examined with the rod test, in which a glass rod was jabbed into the crayfish's container at a 90 degree angle from the bottom and about 0.5 cm directly in front of the crayfish. Crayfish responded to the rod aggressively with claw raising and pinching, neutrally (no response), or by backing or tail-flipping away. The frequency of neutral responses more than doubled after four days in the high (100 mu g.L-1) group and after eight days in the low (1 mu g.L-1) exposure group. Furthermore, most crayfish in the 100 mu g.L-1 treatment were not able to right themselves within 30 s when placed on their backs. Several studies have reported concentrations of imidacloprid contamination in freshwater ecosystems that exceed this study's lowest exposure scenario, 1 mu g.L-1.

This Regulation required the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the European Commission.        Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on acetochlor in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 4 April 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 14 December 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant Task Force consisting of Dow AgroSciences and Monsanto Europe S.A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in August - September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007.        A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 27 September 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 31 July 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 153)        Following the Commission Decision of 05 December 2008 (2008/934/EC)(4) concerning the non-inclusion of acetochlor in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicants made a resubmission application for the inclusion of acetochlor in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(5). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues and concerns identified in the DAR leading to the decision on non-inclusion.        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Spain being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 22 April 2010.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicants for comments on 26 April 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 9 June 2010.        The collated comments were also forwarded to the RMS for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table. The applicants were invited to respond to the comments in column 3 of the Reporting Table. The comments and the applicant's response were evaluated by the RMS in column 3.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the European Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focussed peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology, residues, fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on acetochlor.        The conclusion of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on maize as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in Appendix A.        The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""GF-675"" and ""Mon 69447"" a 400 g/L capsule suspension (CS) and an 840 g/L emulsifiable concentrate (EC) respectively        Residues in food of plant origin are analysed using a common moiety method by LC-MS/MS, data gaps have been identified for validation of the extraction and hydrolysis steps for each metabolite and ILV for the method. Consequently, no valid method is available to quantify residues in food of plant origin. For products of animal origin a method is not required as no MRLs are proposed.        For soil a LC-MS/MS method is available that analyses for acetochlor, t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfonic acid (7), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3) and s-sulfonic acid (13). For surface/ground/drinking water LCMS/MS methods are available for acetochlor, t-oxanilic acid (2), t- sulfonic acid (7), s-sulfonic acid (13) t- norchloroacetochlor (6) and t-sulfinylacetic acid (3). In addition to this there is also a LCMS/MS method for t-norchloroacetochlor (6) in drinking water. Air can be analysed for acetochlor by LC-MS/MS.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Acetochlor has a moderate acute toxicity. The proposed classification is Xn, R20/22 Harmful by inhalation and if swallowed; Xi, R37/38 Irritating to respiratory system and skin; R43 May cause sensitisation by skin contact. In short term studies the dog was the most sensitive species showing decreased body weight gain and histopathological findings in kidneys and testes. Based on the findings in the 52-week study in dog the risk phrase R48/22 ""Harmful: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed"". Many in vitro genotoxicity studies showed positive results but the in vivo tests did not indicate clearly a mutagenic potential. In long term studies different types of tumours were observed with increased incidences and the classification Carc. cat. 3, R40 Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect was proposed. No specific effect on the reproductive parameters was found in multigeneration studies with rats, and no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits.        The groundwater metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3), t-sulfonic acid (7), s-sulfonic acid (13) and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) were considered toxicologically relevant taking into account the limited information available and the carcinogenic potential of the parent compound. The reference values of acetochlor are applicable to the plant metabolite N-oxamic acid (68).        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.0036 mg/kg bw/day using the LOAEL from the 78-week mouse study with a safety factor of 300. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study, with the use of a safety factor of 100. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 1.5 mg/kg bw, derived from the acute rat neurotoxicity study with the application of a safety factor of 100. Two representative formulations were considered in the exposure assessment. For 'GF-675', the operator exposure is below the AOEL with the use of gloves and coverall during mixing/loading and application, and sturdy footwear during application. For 'MON 69447', the estimates with the German and UK models are above the AOEL but a bio-monitoring study measured exposures below the AOEL with the use of tractors and gloves during mixing/loading and coverall during application.        Metabolism of acetochlor was studied in maize plants upon pre-emergence and post-emergence application. Acetochlor was seen to be extensively metabolised, the residues being composed of numerous individual metabolites of which, more than 30 were identified, each accounting for less than 3% of the TRR. The residue definitions were therefore extensively discussed during the PRAPeR 20 and the teleconference TC46 and it was finally agreed to define the residue for monitoring as ""all compounds forming EMA (34) and HEMA (33) on hydrolysis expressed as acetochlor"", considering that the common moieties method developed by the applicant is able to take into account a significant part of the residues. The N-oxamic acid (68) metabolite was added to the EMA and HEMA forming metabolites, in the residue definition for risk assessment and a conversion factor of 2 was proposed for the consumer risk assessment. These residue definitions are also relevant to assess the residues in rotational crops.        Supervised trials confirmed that residues in maize grains, when analysed for EMA and HEMA, are below the limit of quantification. Inversely, significant residues were detected in maize forage. Based on the different ruminant metabolism studies, it was concluded that no residues are expected to be present in animal matrices when considering the intakes resulting from the residues present in maize forage and maize grains. Therefore, the setting of a residue definition and MRLs for products of animal origin was considered not necessary.        No chronic or acute risks were identified when the consumer exposures to food commodities are calculated using the EFSA PRIMo Model and the MRL proposed for maize grains and oil seeds. However, it must be highlighted that the potential consumer exposure exceeds the ADI value in many scenario, when the predicted concentrations of the ground water metabolites are considered. In addition, intakes for toddlers and infants resulting from the water consumption are at times above the threshold value of 20% ADI recommended by the WHO, when calculations are conducted using the concentrations measured in a monitoring program conducted in Northern Italy.        In topsoil under aerobic conditions acetochlor exhibits low to moderate persistence forming the major soil metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2) (max 17 % applied radioactivity (AR)) and t-sulfonic acid (7) (max 11.8% AR) which exhibited moderate to high persistence and t-sulfinylacetic acid (3) (max 18% AR) which exhibited medium to high persistence. The minor soil metabolites s-sulfonic acid (13) (max 9.8% AR) which exhibited moderate to medium persistence and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) (max 3.3% AR) were also identified. Mineralisation of the phenyl radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted only 0.3-3.1 % of applied radioactivity (AR) after 96 days. The formation of unextractable residues was also a significant sink accounting for 15-41 % AR after 84-90 days. Acetochlor exhibits high to medium mobility in soil. t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinyl acetic acid (3) and t-sulfonic acid (7) exhibit very high to high mobility in soil and s-sulfonic acid (13) and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) exhibit very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either acetochlor or these 5 metabolites was pH dependant.        In natural sediment water systems acetochlor exhibited moderate persistence degrading to the major metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2) (max. 13.1% AR in water) and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) (max 10.4% AR in water 19.2% AR in sediment). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for only 1.4-2.7 % AR at 100 days. Unextracted sediment residues were the most significant sink for radioactivity representing 24-50 % AR at 100 days. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for acetochlor at steps 1-4, with spray drift and runoff mitigation being applied at step 4. These exposure assessments as required for metabolites were completed at steps 1-2. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L by parent acetochlor was concluded to be low, in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. A high potential for groundwater contamination > 0.1 mu g/L over significant areas of the EU by the metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3), t-sulfonic acid (7) and s-sulfonic acid (13) that have (on the basis of the available mammalian toxicology data) been concluded as relevant metabolites was identified. A data gap is identified for the stability of the metabolites t-norchloroacetochlor (6) and thydroxyacetochlor (17) in stored frozen groundwater samples. These data are required to finalise the groundwater exposure assessment for these two metabolites.        The short-term TER for birds and the acute and long-term TERs for mammals were above the trigger of 10 and 5 in the first-tier risk assessment. A residue decline study was submitted. The acute risk to herbivorous birds was sufficiently addressed on the basis of measured residues. However the suggested PD and PT values to refine the long-term risk to herbivorous birds were assessed and considered as not supported by the submitted data. The refined risk assessment for insectivorous birds based on crested lark (Galerida cristata) was agreed by the meeting. The risk from consumption of contaminated water was assessed as low for mammals.. It was agreed in the expert meeting, that the risk to mammals is low. However a high acute risk was indicated for birds for post-emergence applications where accumulation of water in leaf axils of maize plants can occur. The risk from secondary poisoning of fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low in the first tier but further refinement was required for earthworm-eating birds and mammals. The risk was sufficiently addressed using data from a bioconcentration study with earthworms. The risk from soil metabolites was considered to be low because their log Pow is <3 suggesting a low potential of bioconcentration and bioaccumulation in the food chain. Endpoints from acute toxicity studies with rats were available for the major plant metabolite N-oxamic acid (68) and for metabolite 3 (t-sulfinylacetic acid). No information on the toxicity to birds was available. In the risk assessment it was assumed that the metabolites have a similar toxicity to birds as the parent. The acute and long-term TERs for birds and mammals were above the triggers of 10 and 5. However some uncertainty remains because of the high proportion of unidentified residues in the residue trials (up to 39% of TRR) and one of the unknown compounds exceeded the threshold of 10% of TRR. The risk from plant metabolites to herbivorous birds was addressed in the additional report.        Acetochlor is very toxic to all groups of aquatic organisms and a high risk was indicated in the risk assessment with FOCUS step3 PECsw. A risk refinement based on endpoints from a static mesocosm and from a mesocosm with a pulsed exposure regime was used to refine the risk in lentic and lotic water bodies. The experts agreed that the NOAEC of 0.2 mu g acetochlor/L for lentic water bodies and the NOAEC of 2 mu g acetochlor/L for lotic water bodies should be used in the risk assessment together with an assessment factor of 2-3. No FOCUS step 4 scenario resulted in a TER exceeding the trigger of 2 even when no-spray buffer zones of 20m and vegetated filter strips of 20m were applied to mitigate the risk. Overall it is concluded that the risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to acetochlor is high for the representative uses evaluated. The risk from metabolites in water and sediment was assessed as low. The bioconcentration potential of acetochlor was assessed as low.        A high in-field risk was identified for both indicator arthropod species for the representative uses with the lead formulation GF-675. Extended laboratory studies indicated a low risk to Aphidius rhopalosiphi but the LD50 for Typhlodromus pyri was below the suggested application rate. However the trigger is met for the off-field area and considering the short half life of acetochlor on vegetation it was considered as likely that re-colonisation is possible. In addition no mortality was observed in the standard laboratory tests with the leaf dwelling species C. carnea at dose rates of 2000 g a.s./ha. Therefore it was concluded in the expert meeting that the risk to leaf dwelling arthropods is low. The risk to soil surface dwelling arthropods from exposure to acetochlor and its soil metabolites was considered to be low.        The acute risk of acetochlor to earthworms was assessed as low. No long-term risk assessment is triggered because the representative uses cover only one application per year and the field DT90 is < 100 days. The acute and long-term risk from soil metabolites to earthworms was assessed as low.        A high risk to non-target terrestrial plants was identified and risk mitigation measures such as a 5m infield no spray buffer zone are required.        The risk to bees, soil macro-organisms, soil-micro organisms, organic matter breakdown and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses of acetochlor.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  18,10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2143     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),acetochlor;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;herbicide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance acetochlor european food safety authority

The physiological and biochemical responses of juvenile Nile tilapia were studied after 96 hours of exposure to TCF. The experiment was conducted randomly with two treatments: control and TCF (0.5 mg L-1). No mortality or changes in hematological profile were recorded for the fish. On the other hand, we found that TCF exposure caused behavioral, metabolic and hormonal changes that modified the response patterns of the immune and enzymatic defense system in muscle and liver tissues. Increased plasma cortisol and glucose combined with the reduction of acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle and liver tissue after 96-h of TCF exposure indicates chemical stress. In response to this harmful situation, we observed changes in the immune system that lead to an increased number of leukocytes, thrombocytes, monocytes, lysozyme and leukocyte respiratory burst activity. Furthermore, we associate the increased activity of glutathione-S-transferase in liver tissue as a strategy fish use to combat the effects of TCF. Thus, we conclude that TCF affects the physiologic parameters of Nile tilapia, which can generate irreversible situations of recovery of the clinical condition. Such fact highlights the need to search for new compounds that could replace TCF, that have no or few adverse effects on fish species. © The Author(s) 2020.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: F.G.

Crucially, chemical element and compound intrusion is a factor behind local species extinction and the mitigation of species recovery efforts. Chemical pollutants are variously defined, but generally they are elements or compounds that may negatively affect the physiology and health of animals. The key points concern the contributory factors of industrial, agricultural and urban technology, and related human activities, with immediate or potential hazards to animals, plants and people, and animal body threshold levels for chemical pollutants. Such chemical elements and compounds include mercury, lead, copper, arsenic, chromium, copper, rodenticides and insecticides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and polychlorinated biphenyls -PCBs. Raptors and waterbirds are particularly susceptible to chemical poisoning, as they eat animals that have ingested such poisons from infected materials, with accumulations at the upper levels of the food chain. This chapter takes a snapshot of the vast area of environmental chemical pollution and examines the factors for such events, the impacts and the ameliorative actions that have been attempted as part of conservation management. Raptors and waterbirds are taken as examples, due to their food chain status and the primary impact of pollutants on small mammals and fish, and carcasses of these and larger mammals. The methodologies employed in the studies are also examined. It is argued that the main culprits for such events, such as agricultural and industrial development, have been increasingly managed by technological advancements and increased ecological knowledge and more competent management. However, the increasing intensity of agricultural and industrial development, compromises the benefits derived from such efforts. Increasingly, fields of knowledge such veterinary science and environmental management claim the interface between environmental chemistry and conservation biology.

The comprehensive evaluation of water resource ecological safety is an important precondition for realizing regional sustainable development with the increasingly serious water ecological crisis. Zhoushan City of China was taken as an example, and the pressure–state–response model (PSR) was used to evaluate the ecological safety status of regional water resources, improve deficiencies in the existing evaluation index system and evaluation method effectively, and put forward three evaluation subsets (18 evaluation indexes). An evaluation index system was established based on these indexes to evaluate the water resource ecological safety. Combined weights of indexes were calculated using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and entropy weight method, and water-resource ecological safety indexes were used to evaluate the water-resource ecological safety status in Zhoushan City during 2010–2019. Results show that the water-resource ecological safety level in Zhoushan City during 2010–2019 presents a rising trend and transformed from a serious warning state into a medium warning state as well as a relatively safe state and safe state. This transformation indicates that the ecological safety status in Zhoushan City gradually improves. The comprehensive evaluation value is the minimum (0.15) under the serious warning state in 2013 and the maximum (0.85) under the safe state in 2019. Ammonia nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand (COD) emissions in industrial wastewater, total water supply throughout the year, and governance area of water and soil loss are the main factors that influence the water resource ecological safety in the city. The ecological safety level of regional water resources can be effectively elevated through key measures, such as increasing the water resource supply throughout the year, reducing the application of pesticides and chemical fertilizers, and reducing the discharge of pollutants, including COD and ammonia nitrogen in industrial wastewater. The water resource ecological safety evaluation model based on the PSR model and AHP–entropy weight method that demonstrates a certain application value can provide a novel idea and method to support the ecological safety evaluation of regional water resources. © 2021 Technoscience Publications.

But the fish is known for its greater adaptive capability even in adverse environmental condition and is regarded as champions in tolerating such type of aquatic environments. Therefore, it seems to be a suitable model for the study of toxicological effect of the paraquat dichloride (1, 1′-dimethyl-4, 4′-bipyridinium dichloride), a recognized contact herbicide which is highly noxious to humans and animals. The aim of this study was to investigate the toxicity of paraquat (PQ) when used in sub-lethal concentrations of 6 mg/L and 12 mg/L respectively, as determined from the LC50 value. The oxidative stress markers in liver, kidney and intestine of the fish; alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatise enzymes in the blood serum and haematological parameters of the fishes were evaluated at 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, 5 days, 10 days and 14 days post treatment with 6 mg/L and 12 mg/L of PQ. The results revealed the increased concentration of glutathione-S-transferase (GST), specifically after 10 days of treatment with 12 mg/L paraquat concentration, along with significant increase in the concentration of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde after 14 days of PQ exposure (12 mg/L concentration), when tallied against the control. However, the concentration of non-enzymatic reduced glutathione (GSH) was decreased significantly in treated fishes after 14 days (12 mg/L concentration) as GST uses GSH as a substrate to detoxify substances, hence enabling more defence against ROS production in H. fossilis. Haematological indices like the RBC count and haemoglobin concentration manifested a significant reduction, while the WBC count significantly increased on exposure to both 6 mg/L and 12 mg/L concentrations of PQ as compared to control fish. These findings clearly indicated the increased concentration of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GST) and reduction in non enzymatic GSH enabled the fish to survive during the PQ exposure period. © 2020, Zoological Society, Kolkata, India.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: M.

To provide pre-clinical data in support of this hypothesis, we used two distinct experimental models. First, female and male mice were fed immediately prior to mating, and the resulting pregnant dams were continously fed during gestation and lactation periods using chow pellets containing a cocktail of six pesticides at tolerable daily intake levels. Male and female offspring were then tracked for behavioral and in vivo electrophysiological adaptations. Second, a zebrafish model allowed us to screen toxicity and motor-behavior outcomes specifically associated with the developmental exposure to a low-to-high concentration range of the cocktail and of each individual pesticide. Here, we report anxiety-like behavior in aging male mice maternally exposed to the cocktail, as compared to age and gender matched sham animals. In parallel, in vivo electrocorticography revealed a decrease in gamma (40–80 Hz) and an increase of theta (6–9 Hz) waves, delineating a long-term, age-dependent, neuronal slowing. Neurological changes were not accompanied by brain structural malformations. Next, by using zebrafish larvae, we showed an increase of all motor-behavioral parameters resulting from the developmental exposure to 10 μg/L of pesticide cocktail, an outcome that was not associated with midbrain structural or neurovascular modifications as assessed by in vivo 2-photon microscopy. When screening each pesticide, chlorpyrifos elicited modifications of swimming parameters at 0.1 μg/L, while other components provoked changes from 0.5 μg/L. Ziram was the single most toxic component inducing developmental malformations and mortality at 10 μg/L. Although we have employed non-equivalent modalities and timing of exposure in two dissimilar experimental models, these outcomes indicate that presence of a pesticide cocktail during perinatal periods represents an element promoting behavioral and neurophysiological modifications. The study limitations and the possible pertinence of our findings to ecotoxicology and public health are critically discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: N.

These compounds may pose significant risks to non-target exposed organisms and only limited studies are available on bioconcentration and the effects of organophosphorus derivatives on marine organisms. The aim of this work was to evaluate the possible toxic effects of two concentrations (20 and 40 μg/L) of γ-oximo- and γ-amino-phosphonates and phosphine oxides in mediterranean clams Ruditapes decussatus exposed for 14 days using different biomarkers and the changes of filtration and respiration rate. The use of clams in ecotoxicity evaluation is thus mandatory to assess the feasibility of assessing oxidative stress on R. decussatus after being exposed to γ-oximo- and γ-amino-phosphonates and phosphine oxides. The oxidative status was analyzed by measuring oxidative stress biomarkers RNS and ROS production in mitochondria, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), whose alteration was indicative of organophosphorus exposure, in both gills and digestive gland of the clams. No significant alterations in RNS, ROS production, SOD, CAT and AChE activities and MDA content were observed in both organs of clams treated with γ-oximophosphine oxides. It was possible then to hypothesize that γ-oximophosphine oxides may have probably exerted an incomplete alteration of antioxidant defenses and damage, which was changed by the activation of defense mechanisms. On the contrary, oxidative stress parameters were changed after exposure to γ-amino-phosphonates and phosphine oxides. In addition, metals accumulation, filtration and respiration rates were altered following exposure to all the studied organophosphorus compounds. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 5; CODEN: MPNBA,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112556,"Clams;Filtration;Metals accumulation;Oxidative stress;Respiration;γ-Aminophosphine oxides;γ-Aminophosphonates;γ-Oximophosphine oxides;Animals;Biomarkers;Bivalvia;Catalase;Ecosystem;Gills;Lipid Peroxidation;Organophosphonates;Oxidative Stress;Oxides;Phosphines;Superoxide Dismutase;Water Pollutants, Chemical;Venerupis (Ruditapes) decussatus;Aquatic ecosystems;Enzymes;Marine biology;Shellfish;acetylcholinesterase;catalase;diethyl [3 (benzylamino) 1 phenylbutyl]phosphonic acid;gamma amino phosphine oxide derivative;gamma amino phosphonic acid derivative;gamma oximo phosphine oxide derivative;gamma oximo phosphonic acid derivative;glutathione transferase;phosphine oxide derivative;phosphonic acid derivative;reactive nitrogen species;reactive oxygen metabolite;superoxide dismutase;unclassified drug;[3 (benzylamino) 1,3 diphenylpropyl]diphenylphosphine oxide;[3 (h ydroxyimino) 1 phenylbutyl]diphenylphosphine oxide;[3 (hydroxyimino) 1 (thiophen 2 yl)butyl]diphenylphosphine oxide;biological marker;oxide;phosphine;phosphine derivative;Aminophosphines;Aminophosphonates;Filtration rates;Metal accumulation;Phosphine oxide;Ruditapes decussatus;Γ-aminophosphine oxide;Γ-aminophosphonate;Γ-oximophosphine oxide;aquatic ecosystem;bioaccumulation;biochemical composition;biomarker;ecotoxicology;filtration;mollusc;organophosphate;oxidative stress;physiological response;respiration;animal tissue;Article;breathing rate;carbon nuclear magnetic resonance;case study;column chromatography;controlled study;ecotoxicity;enzyme activity;exocrine gland;feasibility study;gill;lipid peroxidation;nonhuman;phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance;proton nuclear magnetic resonance;Ruditapes;toxicity testing;animal;bivalve;chemistry;ecosystem;metabolism;water pollutant;Molluscs",NA,NA,toxicity assessment of organophosphorus in ruditapes decussatus via physiological chemical and biochemical determination a case study with the compounds γoximo and γaminophosphonates and phosphine oxides

Both involve attempts to alter complex arrangements that have been pieced together through long periods of time. And both run the risk of unintended consequences. In biology, an apparently helpful mutation that confers, say, insecticide resistance in an insect might inadvertently also cause, say, sterility. And in societies, an apparently helpful change to correct a conspicuous problem might inadvertently also cause other, perhaps more serious, problems. Biological and social change also differ in some ways. Biological evolution depends on a random process of mutation whereas social change involves agents who sometimes rationally conceive of ideas directed at fixing a problem. Evolutionary biologists have modeled biological change using Fisher’s so-called geometric model of adaptation. Here we slightly modify Fisher’s model to study social change. We find that, even when agents (e.g., central planners) are skilled enough to perfectly correct the problem that they set out to fix, unintended consequences are so common and severe that half the time society is left worse off than before. Put differently, the median society is no better or worse off after a “perfect” intervention than before. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: H.A.

It is unclear if the adverse effects associated with developmental exposure to the active CPO persist into adulthood and future generations. The goal of this study was to investigate whether CPO-associated changes in embryo-larval zebrafish (ZF) behavior at the F0 5 dpf were manifest throughout the life of the exposed F0, and are inherited by subsequent generations. For this study, embryos were exposed to chlorpyrifos-oxon at the environmentally relevant concentration of 0.01 μg/L and a high concentration of 50 μg/L starting at 4 hpf to 5 dpf, and then raised to F2. There was a significant decrease in distance traveled with 5 dpf F0 ZF exposed to the 50 μg/L CPO, with alterations in noncholinergic genes CFOS and LINGO, and alterations in global DNA methylation. CPO-related behavioral effects were ameliorated by day 21 through the F1 generation. This trend changed with hyperactive behavior, increase acetylcholine concentration in F2 zebrafish that were exposed to 50 μg/L CPO during the F0 development. There was also an increase in AChE activity and hypermethylation in F2 0.01 μg/L exposure larvae, indicating that even low dose exposures can have transgenerational effects. Results from this study demonstrate that early life stage exposures to CPO can lead to epigenetic changes in neurological activity, which may lead to alterations in response to CPO in future generations.

We exposed fish (0.7 ± 0.05 g in weight) to 0, 1, 2 and 3 mg L-1 diazinon (60 fish in each 3replicate 60-L glass tank) for 7 days in freshwater. Diazinon concentrations were chosen based on reports on its concentration in surface waters. Mortality rate, histological events of olfactory epithelium, and genes expression at the 7th day after diazinon exposure included a significant decrease in the number of olfactory receptor cells (ORCs), while increased goblet cells (GCs). In addition, G­protein αi (Gpαi) was significantly upregulated, whereas calmodulin-dependent kinase II α (CaMKIIα) was significantly downregulated after 7 days as compared to the control group.

Although the regu-lon that these factors control is known in many bacteria, similar data are not available for Klebsiella pneumoniae. To address this data gap, oxidative stress was artificially induced in K. pneumoniae MGH78578 using paraquat and the corresponding oxidative stress regulon recorded using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). The soxS gene was significantly induced during oxidative stress, and a knockout mutant was constructed to explore its functionality. The wild type and mutant were grown in the presence of paraquat and subjected to RNA-seq to elucidate the soxS regulon in K. pneumoniae MGH78578. Genes that are commonly regulated both in the oxidative stress and soxS regulons were identified and denoted as the oxidative SoxS regulon; these included a group of genes specifically regulated by SoxS. Efflux pump-encoding genes and global regulators were identified as part of this regulon. Consequently, the isogenic soxS mutant was found to exhibit a reduction in the minimum bactericidal concentration against tetracycline compared to that of the wild type. Impaired efflux activity, allowing tetracycline to be accumulated in the cytoplasm to bactericidal levels, was further eval-uated using a tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+ ) accumulation assay. The soxS mutant was also susceptible to tetracycline in vivo in a zebrafish embryo model. We conclude that the soxS gene could be considered a genetic target against which an inhibitor could be developed and used in combinatorial therapy to combat infections associated with multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae. © 2021 Anes et al.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: S.

FESTF was organized by pesticide registrants to develop information sufficient to address FIFRA data requirements imposed on these registrants. The work accomplished by, and continuing through, the Task Force has provided necessary information for many pesticide product registrations and re-registrations in the United States, but via a path not initially anticipated under the typical expectations for Task Force data development. The Task Force covers a wide cross-section of pesticide registrants that benefit from this endeavor and has submitted multiple datasets to EPA and other federal Services (e.g., the Fish and Wildlife Service – United States Department of the Interior [USDI], National Marine Fisheries Service – National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA]). FESTF has also developed a customized information management system that allows access to and comparison of data in a spatial and tabular software environment. The original mission of the was envisioned to be addressed through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for the purposes of EPA’s state by state assembly of data for listed species. However, the CRADA proved unworkable, and rather than EPA being burdened by the task of data assembly, FESTF took on the effort and commitment to support data aggregation and software program development. This chapter will explore the challenges that required unique approaches to data provisioning and will assess how 25 years of operations, constantly changing data, shifting policy, and advancing technology have been managed to address the complex data interactions brought about by FIFRA Registration Review and subsequent ESA consultation, and ultimately expected to be adopted routinely into the overall FIFRA registration process. © 2021 American Chemical Society","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: B.D.

Discovery of antiangiogenic agents targeting different mechanisms of action is the major area of research to control tumor growth and metastasis. Zebrafish (in the embryo-larvae stage) acts as an essential preclinical efficacy–toxicity model for antiangiogenic drug discovery. We aimed to develop a carcinogen-induced model of proangiogenesis in zebrafish embryo-larvae using the carcinogens lindane and benzo[a]pyrene. Zebrafish were randomly selected for mating. Postspawning, healthy embryos were staged, dispensed in reverse-osmosis water in a 12-well plate, and incubated at 28.5 °C, wherein 24 h postfertilization they were exposed to sublethal concentrations of the carcinogens. Three days postexposure, embryos were stained with alkaline phosphatase, and the angiogenic basket was imaged using a bright-field microscope. The number of subintestinal vessels, their length from somite to the basket, and other proangiogenic parameters were measured and analyzed. The effective concentrations causing a 30% increase in subintestinal vessels for benzo[a]pyrene and lindane were 2.69 and 2.24 µM, respectively, thus proving their proangiogenic potency. The carcinogen-induced model of proangiogenesis in zebrafish embryo-larvae can be used as an effective high-throughput screening tool to assess the proangiogenic potential of carcinogenic compounds and to screen antiangiogenic drugs for better therapeutic intervention.

The suicide rate tended to be low in the high skill occupations except the manager group. The suicide rates showed increases around the financial crises of 1997 and 2008 in most occupations, and the sharpest increase was observed in the managers. The suicide rate in the manager group, which was the lowest among all occupation groups until the mid 2000s, showed the sharpest increase and became the highest since 2012 among all occupation groups. The sustained reduction in suicide rates among the skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers in Korea, following the implementation of paraquat control since 2005, shows that means restriction is an effective and essential way for reducing suicides. While more efforts should be put into means restriction, policy makers should focus on changing public perceptions of suicide in order that it would not be accepted as a possible solution for the difficulties in life. © 2021","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: A.M.

Methods Prospective study using the data collected at baseline and at the first 12 month-follow-up for the 18,018 participants included in the population-based Constances cohort between 2012 and 2015. CTS at follow-up and exposure to biomechanical wrist stressors and chemicals at baseline were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. Associations between CTS and co-exposure to biomechanical wrist stressors and chemicals were studied using multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for personal/medical factors. Results 184 men (2.1%, 95%CI 1.8–2.4) and 331 women (3.6%, 3.2–3.9) free from chronic hand symptoms at baseline declared suffering from unilateral/bilateral CTS at follow-up. A potentiating effect of co-exposure to biomechanical wrist stressors and chemicals on the risk of CTS was found for both genders, with higher OR in the co-exposure group (OR = 3.38 [2.29–5.01] in men and OR = 4.12 [2.73–6.21] in women) than in the biomechanical exposure group (OR = 2.14 [1.51–3.03] in men and OR = 2.19 [1.72–2.78] in women) compared to no exposure group. Conclusions The study showed an association between CTS and co-exposure to biomechanical wrist stressors and chemicals, after adjustment for the main personal and medical factors. This finding should be confirmed using more objective case definition of CTS and assessment of the chemical exposure before drawing conclusions on the possible synergistic effects of mechanical stressors and chemical on the median nerve. © 2020 Roquelaure et al.

In present study, the anti-aging and anti-oxidative stress effects of CSSPs were evaluated in Drosophila melanogaster models. Results showed that the addition of CSSPs in the diets of normal Drosophila could effectively extend their lifespan and improve the motor ability of aged Drosophila. Moreover, CSSPs could protect Drosophila from oxidative damage induced by H2O2, paraquat and UV irradiation. The extension of lifespan was found to be associated with the effects of CSSPs in improving the antioxidant defense system of Drosophila, manifesting as the reduction of oxidation products MDA and PCO, the elevated activities of T-SOD, CAT and GSH-Px, and the upregulated expression of antioxidant related genes after CSSPs supplemented. Furthermore, CSSPs at 6 mg/mL significantly downregulated mTOR signaling pathway and activated autophagy in aged male Drosophila, and the inhibition on mTOR activation was probably mediated by the antioxidant effects of CSSPs. Our findings suggest that CSSPs have the potential in making dietary supplements against natural aging and oxidative stress in organisms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: S.

Our primary aim was to determine the association between occupations/occupational exposures and odds of gastric cancer. Methods: We conducted a pooled-analysis of individual-level data harmonized from 11 studies in the Stomach cancer Pooling Project. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of gastric cancer adjusted for relevant confounders. Results: A total of 5279 gastric cancer cases and 12 297 controls were analysed. There were higher odds of gastric cancer among labour-related occupations, including: agricultural and animal husbandry workers [odds ratio (OR) 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.68]; miners, quarrymen, well-drillers and related workers (OR 1.70, 95% CI: 1.01-2.88); blacksmiths, toolmakers and machine-tool operators (OR 1.41, 95% CI: 1.05-1.89); bricklayers, carpenters and construction workers (OR 1.30, 95% CI: 1.06-1.60); and stationary engine and related equipment operators (OR 6.53, 95% CI: 1.41-30.19). The ORs for wood-dust exposure were 1.51 (95% CI: 1.01-2.26) for intestinal-type and 2.52 (95% CI: 1.46-4.33) for diffuse-type gastric cancer. Corresponding values for aromatic amine exposure were 1.83 (95% CI: 1.09-3.06) and 2.92 (95% CI: 1.36-6.26). Exposure to coal derivatives, pesticides/herbicides, chromium, radiation and magnetic fields were associated with higher odds of diffuse-type, but not intestinal-type gastric cancer. Conclusions: Based on a large pooled analysis, we identified several occupations and related exposures that are associated with elevated odds of gastric cancer. These findings have potential implications for risk attenuation and could be used to direct investigations evaluating the impact of targeted gastric cancer prevention/early detection programmes based on occupation. © The Author(s) 2020; all rights reserved.

Currently used LFAs predominantly use antibodies. However, the high inter-batch variations, error margin and storage requirements of the conventional antibody-based LFAs significantly impede its applications. The recent progress in aptamer technology provides an opportunity to combine the potential of aptamer and LFA towards building a promising platform for highly efficient point-of-care device development. Over the past decades, different forms of aptamer-based LFAs have been introduced for broad applications ranging from disease diagnosis, agricultural industry to environmental sciences, especially for the detection of antibody-inaccessible small molecules such as toxins and heavy metals. But commercial aptamer-based LFAs are still not used widely compared with antibodies. In this work, by analysing the key issues of aptamer-based LFA design, including immobilization strategies, signalling methods, and target capturing approaches, we provide a comprehensive overview about aptamer-based LFA design strategies to facilitate researchers to develop optimised aptamer-based LFAs. © The author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 46; Correspondence Address: R.N.

A unified strategy for such collaborative testing is presented. It details all procedures required to allow test information to be usable for integrated hazard assessment, strategic project decisions and/or for regulatory purposes. The EU-ToxRisk project developed a strategy to provide regulatorily valid data, and exemplified this using a panel of > 20 assays (with > 50 individual endpoints), each exposed to 19 well-known test compounds (e.g. rotenone, colchicine, mercury, paracetamol, rifampicine, paraquat, taxol). Examples of strategy implementation are provided for all aspects required to ensure data validity: (i) documentation of test methods in a publicly accessible database; (ii) deposition of standard operating procedures (SOP) at the European Union DB-ALM repository; (iii) test readiness scoring accoding to defined criteria; (iv) disclosure of the pipeline for data processing; (v) link of uncertainty measures and metadata to the data; (vi) definition of test chemicals, their handling and their behavior in test media; (vii) specification of the test purpose and overall evaluation plans. Moreover, data generation was exemplified by providing results from 25 reporter assays. A complete evaluation of the entire test battery will be described elsewhere. A major learning from the retrospective analysis of this large testing project was the need for thorough definitions of the above strategy aspects, ideally in form of a study pre-registration, to allow adequate interpretation of the data and to ensure overall scientific/toxicological validity. © 2020, The Author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 27; Correspondence Address: M.

For example, increasing food production may involve irrigation from riparian sources that may adversely impact fisheries habitats, the siting of solar energy on agricultural lands can impact food production, and increasing food production capacity may require pesticides in certain locations, resulting in environmental pollution. Because public preferences are an important component of support for and opposition to FWE policy design and implementation, it is important to understand the correlates of support and opposition to FWE policy tradeoffs. Using survey data from random household surveys conducted in western U.S. states during 2018, this study examined how environmental efficacy, values, and knowledge affected FWE public tradeoff preferences. The findings suggest that these characteristics do affect public FWE tradeoff preferences, with knowledge being a strong driver of support for food production over biofuels, water friendly crops over meat production and conservation over water intensive agriculture. Additionally, environmental efficacy and pro-ecological attitudes drive support for access to safe drinking water and sanitation over food security for a growing population. © 2020 by the authors.

Identifying the pathways of pesticide impact can be multifaceted as well as complex, as humankind faces the magnificent challenge of food systems reconfiguration toward providing and delivering healthy foods that individuals can access while protecting planetary health. Ideally, chemical pesticides used inappropriately in agricultural activities has shaped serious health as well as environmental problems in the global south. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) as well as World Health Organization (WHO) approximate that the rates of pesticide poisoning occur 2-3 times per minute, having roughly 20,000 employees dying yearly from exposure, mostly in emerging countries. From an environmental point of view, “chemically-polluted runoff” comes through fields that pollute both ground as well as surface waters, destroying freshwater ecosystems, damaged fisheries, as well as creating growing and sustainable ""dead zones"" in the coastal areas near the river’s mouths of the drain agricultural areas. The environmental as well as health hazards resulting from pesticides could remain comparatively avoided through education as the first step towards achieving the SDGs as well as creating sustainable incentives toward curbing the overuse trend. Other important challenges need to be resolved, for example social inclusion; poverty reduction; education, increased equity as well as health care; sustainable energy; conservation of biodiversity; water security; and changing climate adaptation as well as mitigation. These challenges are interlinked as well as embodied in 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which all UN member states have accepted since 2015 as well as built round the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Therefore, managing the rapid accelerators considerately will need negotiation as well as collaboration from a wide range of civil society sector, private as well as public actors. The time has come toward putting the challenge of sociotechnical innovation as well as massive human ingenuity toward usage to safeguard the next generations as well as the planet future. While, the world is not on the pathway toward realizing its global goals come 2030. Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, uneven progress had been witnessed, as well as more focused considerations was required in many areas.

The tissues of infected fish were subjected to an ordinary bacteriological identification and were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry techniques. The results indicated that the selective primers that have been designed for detecting the gene encoding the apoptotic-induced protein, AIP56, represent a powerful tool for sensitive and specific detection of virulent strains of Phdp. AIP56 toxin triggers apoptosis of host macrophages and neutrophils, contributing to the lesions observed during the pathological investigation.

Plants from the genus Tephrosia are rich in bioactive phytochemicals, particularly rotenoids which include rotenone, deguelin, rotenolone, and tephrosin. Rotenoids have strong insecticidal activities against a wider range of pests. However, there has been no treatise thus far focusing on Tephrosia as insecticidal plants. This article is intended to review phytochemicals produced by selected species, their insecticidal activities, and the current status on the use of Tephrosia as botanical insecticidal plants for insect pest control.        Synthetic insecticides are effective in controlling insect pests but can also harm nontarget organisms and the environment. During the last 40 years, there has been an increasing interest in alternative insecticides, particularly those derived from plants, commonly known as botanical insecticides. However, commercially available botanical insecticides remain limited. Rotenone is one of the earliest identified compounds and was used as fish poison and pest management. Due to its link with Parkinson disease, the use of rotenone was banned in many developed countries. Rotenone used to be isolated from Derris spp. and Lonchocarpus spp., and it can also be isolated from Tephrosia species. In this article, we present basic botanical information on selected Tephrosia species and their major compounds related to insecticidal activities and highlight the current use of extracts derived from some species, Tephrosia vogelii in particular, for control of insect pests in stored grains and crop production. The crude extracts contain multiple bioactive compounds, mainly rotenone, deguelin, rotenolone, and tephrosin, which act in either additive or synergistic fashion, resulting in effective control of insect pests. There are about 400 species in the genus Tephrosia, and species and even strains or variants vary greatly in these active compounds. We argue that a systematic evaluation of bioactive compounds in different species are needed, and species or strains with high insecticidal activities should be selected for use in the sustainable control of insect pests.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  25     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  118,10.3390/insects11100721     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),botanical pesticides;deguelin;insects;rotenolone;rotenone;tephrosin;Tephrosia;vogelii;NATURAL-PRODUCTS;DEFENSIN TVD1;VOGELII;ROTENONE;DEGUELIN;CONSTITUENTS;CANDIDA;ANTIFUNGAL;FLAVONOIDS;SEPARATION;Insecticides,NA,NA,plants in the genus <i>tephrosia<i> valuable resources for botanical insecticides

The biochemical assays was conducted in two times including at the end of feeding period and after 24 h exposure to diazinon. According to the results, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the liver remained unchanged (P>0.01) during feeding period, while significantly increased in response to diazinon in control and fish fed 5 and 10 g/kg diet SAE (P<0.01).

Although numerous studies have shown atrazine produces adverse effects on growth, development, immune and endocrine system functions in a wide range of species, few describe gene expression changes concurrent with atrazine-induced changes in phenotype during development. In this report, developing Xenopus laevis tadpoles were chronically exposed to 400 ppb atrazine, an environmentally relevant concentration. Affymetrix microarrays and Taqman qRT-PCR were used to define gene expression changes that underlie atrazine-induced phenotypic alterations. Atrazine significantly reduced survival and growth (weight, length and fat body size) in male and female tadpoles. Microarray analysis showed atrazine altered expression of 44 genes in male tadpoles (18 upregulated, 26 downregulated) and 77 genes in female tadpoles (23 upregulated, 54 downregulated). Classification of the genes into functional groups showed the majority of genes were associated with the following biological functions: growth and metabolism, proteolysis, fibrinogen complex formation and immune regulation. Seven genes associated with immune system function, specifically defense molecules present in the skin (e.g. magainin II, levitide A, preprocarulein, skin granule protein), were significantly downregulated in female tadpoles.

With the development of intensive aquaculture, carp production has increased dramatically, leading to the frequent occurrence of various diseases. Cell lines are considered the most cost-effective resource for in vitro studies and are widely used for physiological and pathological studies because of accessibility and convenience. This research established a novel immortal cell line CCM (Yellow River carp muscle cells) derived from the carp muscle. CCM has been passed over 71 generations for 1 year. The morphology of CCM and the adhesion and extension processes were captured by light and electron microscopy. CCM were passaged every 3 days with 20% FBS DMEM/F12 at 1:3. The optimum conditions for CCM growth were 28 degrees C and 20% FBS concentration. DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA and COI showed that CCM was derived from carp. CCM positively reacts to anti-PAX7 and anti-MyoD antibodies of carp. Analysis of chromosomes revealed that the chromosomal pattern number of CCM was 100. Transfection experiment demonstrated that CCM might be utilized to express foreign genes. Furthermore, cytotoxicity testing showed that CCM was susceptible to Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas sal-monicida, Aeromonas veronii, and Staphylococcus Aureus. The organophosphate pesticides (chlorpyrifos and glyphosate) or heavy metals (Hg, Cd, and Cu) exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity against CCM. After LPS treatment, the MyD88-IRAKs-NF & kappa;B pathway stimulates inflammatory-related factor il1 & beta;, il8, il10, and nf & kappa;b expression. LPS did not seem to cause oxidative stress in CCM, and the expression of cat and sod was not affected. Poly (I:C) through TLR3-TRIF-MyD88-TRAF6-NF & kappa;B and TRIF-TRAF3-TBK1-IRF3 activated the transcription of related factors, increased expression of anti-viral protein, but no changes in apoptosis-related genes. To our knowledge, this is the first muscle cell line in Yellow River carp and the first study on the immune response signal pathways of Yellow River carp based on the muscle cell line. CCM cell line provides a more rapid and efficient experimental material for fish immunology research, and this study preliminarily elucidated its immune response strategy to LPS and poly (I:C).",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  49,10.1016/j.fsi.2023.108859,Muscle cell line;Cytotoxic effect;LPS;Poly (I;C);Immune response strategy;NONSPECIFIC DEFENSE;EXPRESSION;RECOGNITION;MECHANISMS;RESPONSES;RECEPTOR;TRIF;Cell Line,NA,NA,establishment and characterization of yellow river carp<i> cyprinus<i><i> carpio<i><i> haematopterus<i> muscle cell line and its application to fish virology and immunology

Genetic and environmental factors are believed to be responsible for neuronal diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alz-heimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. It is difficult to restore normal nervous function after neuro -degeneration; hence, prevention could be the best strategy against these diseases. Ayurved medicines such as Suvarna Bhasma (SB) have enormous potential to treat these neurological diseases.Aim: The aim of this study is to examine the protective effect of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish. Materials and methods: In this study, we induced Parkinson's-like disease model in zebrafish by inducing it with rotenone (7 mu g/L). We examined the behavioural, proteomics and dopamine alterations of rotenone induced zebrafish of SB pre-treated group as compared to the control group.Results: The behavioural experiments showed that due to rotenone exposure, Parkinson's-like behavioural ab-normality was induced in zebrafish. However, because of SB treatment, this behavioural abnormality was reduced. The proteomics study of zebrafish brains clearly showed that the SB-treated group was not significantly affected due to rotenone exposure. However, in the SB non-treated group, expression of nine proteins that are linked to Parkinson's disease (gene name: sncgb, ywhae1, ywhah, uchl1, ywhaba, psma6a, ywhabl, ywhaqb, and ywhabb) were differentially expressed after rotenone exposure. Finally, prevention of dopamine alteration in SB-treated fish brains confirmed the protective action of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish.

We investigated whether in vitro TCPM has an influence on the function of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication (GJIC) and gap junction protein expression of connexin 43 (Cx43) in cultured bovine granulosa cells. GJIC was assessed by fluorescent dye microinjection (dye-coupling). After a 1-h exposure to TCPM at a concentration of 32 mum, a significant (P<0.05) reduction in dye coupling occurred. The same result was obtained with o,p'-DDT. At a concentration of 32 mum both pesticides were cytotoxic as indicated by significant (P<0.05) increased propidium iodide staining of the cell nuclei. Little or no effect on the stainable pattern of connexons occurred after 1 h incubation time, while after 3 h treatment from 16 to 64 km TCPM, a significant inhibition in the immunostaining resulted and the concentrations of 32 and 64 mum TCPM were cytotoxic for the granulosa cells. The freeze-fracture electron microscopy resulted in small differences in the morphology of gap junction plaques of cell cultures treated for 3 h with 8 or 16 mum TCPM in comparison to untreated cells. After treatment with 32 pm TCPM, gap junction plaques were very rarely detected and the lateral intramembraneous particles (IMP) distribution of many plasma membranes was strongly altered. Estimation of the cellular parameters may lead to an enhanced understanding of the mechanism of chemically induced toxicity by TCPM, that causes a general toxic effect on granulosa cells. We can conclude that TCPM is a toxic risk in the same manner as DDT.

A variety of illnesses are initiated or aided by the presence of certain perturbing factors. In the case of autism spectrum disorder, the environmental component plays an important part in determining the overall picture. Moreover, the lack of therapies to relieve existing symptoms complicates the fight against this condition. As a result, animal models have been used to make biomedical research easier and more suited for disease investigations. The current study used zebrafish as an animal model to mimic a real-life scenario: acute exposure to an increased dose of pesticides, followed by prospective intervention-based therapy with vitamin B-12 (vit. B-12). It is known that vit. B-12 is involved in brain function nerve tissue, and red blood cell formation. Aside from this, the role of vit. B-12 in the redox processes is recognized for its help against free radicals. To investigate the effect of vit. B-12, fish were divided into four different groups and exposed to a pesticide mixture (600 mu g L-1 fipronil + 600 mu g L-1 pyriproxyfen) and 0.24 mu g L-1 vit. B-12 for 14 days. The impact of the compounds was assessed daily with EthoVision XT 11.5 software for behavioral observations, especially for sociability, quantified by the social interaction test. In addition, at the end of the study, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured. The results showed significant improvements in locomotor activity parameters and a positive influence of the vitamin on sociability. Regarding the state of oxidative stress, high activity was found for SOD and GPx in the case of vit. B-12, while fish exposed to the mixture of pesticides and vit. B-12 had a lower level of MDA. In conclusion, the study provides new data about the effect of vit.

Various aquatic pollutants derived from industrial effluents, overuse of some agricultural pesticides, herbicides and insecticides may cause devastating toxicological aspects of aquatic organisms and deteriorate their health and growth. They also led to oxidative stress to fish due to the stimulation of the production of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the need for using natural antioxidants to be used as feed additives is of great importance to counteract the hazardous oxidative stress responses. The use of phytochemicals, which characterized by substantial antioxidative effects, has been raised. Lycopene is the principal carotenoid pigment found in tomatoes and their products, vegetables and red fruits. Numerous studies have recommended the use of lycopene as a powerful antioxidant to attenuate the oxidative stress responses in several fish species exposed to various toxicants or any other stress conditions. Lycopene maintains the health condition of fish by enhancing the immune and antioxidative responses.

The mRNA expressions of these genes in the different tissues (liver, brain, spleen, kidney, and skin) were observed. The highest expression levels of myd88, irak-1, and irf5 were detected in the spleen, whereas iI-8 and irf7 were detected in the kidney and liver respectively. The mRNA expression of irak-1, irf5, and irf7 in the liver from 0.1 mu g/L. and 0.5 mu g/L CPF treatments were significantly increased on day 7 (p < 0.05), whereas the levels of only irak-1 and irf7 were markedly increased on day 28 (p < 0.05). Moreover, the mRNA expression of il-8 in the spleen following 0.5 mu g/L CPF treatments was significantly decreased on day 7 (p < 0.05), whereas significantly decrease were observed in the levels of irf7 in the spleen at 2.5 mu g/L CPF on days 7 and 28 (p < 0.05). The 0.1 mu g/t. and 0.5 mu g/L of CPF significantly induced the levels of irak-1 and myd88 in the spleen after 28 d exposure (p < 0.05). Therefore, the high induction of cytokines and TLR pathway signaling molecules demonstrated that Chinese rare minnow was immune-compromised exposed to CPF. Moreover, our finding indicated that these immune-related genes could be feasible to screen for substances hazardous to the immune system of fish. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental exposures to mitochondrial toxicants occur widely and are increasingly frequent. Exposures to these mitotoxicants may pose a serious threat to organismal health and the onset of diseases by disrupting immunometabolic pathways. In this study, we investigated whether the Complex I inhibitor rotenone could alter C. elegans immunometabolism and disease susceptibility. C. elegans embryos were exposed to rotenone (0.5 mu M) or DMSO (0.125%) until they reached the L4 larval stage. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by rotenone and disruption of mitochondrial metabolism were evidenced by rotenone-induced detrimental effects on mitochondrial efficiency and nematode growth and development. Next, through transcriptomic analysis, we investigated if this specific but mild mitochondrial stress that we detected would lead to the modulation of immunometabolic pathways. We found 179 differentially expressed genes (DEG), which were mostly involved in detoxification, energy metabolism, and pathogen defense. Interestingly, among the down-regulated DEG, most of the known genes were involved in immune defense, and most of these were identified as commonly upregulated during P. aeruginosa infection. Furthermore, rotenone increased susceptibility to the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14). However, it increased resistance to Salmonella enterica (SL1344). To shed light on potential mechanisms related to these divergent effects on pathogen resistance, we assessed the activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), a well-known immunometabolic pathway in C. elegans which links mitochondria and immunity and provides resistance to pathogen infection. The UPRmt pathway was activated in rotenone-treated nematodes further exposed for 24 h to the pathogenic bacteria P. aeruginosa and S. enterica or the common bacterial food source Escherichia coli (OP50). However, P. aeruginosa alone suppressed UPRmt activation and rotenone treatment rescued its activation only to the level of DMSO-exposed nematodes fed with E. coli. Module-weighted annotation bioinformatics analysis was also consistent with UPRmt activation in rotenone-exposed nematodes consistent with the UPR being involved in the increased resistance to S. enterica. Together, our results demonstrate that the mitotoxicant rotenone can disrupt C. elegans immunometabolism in ways likely protective against some pathogen species but sensitizing against others.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  89,10.3389/fimmu.2022.840272     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),immunotoxicity;metabolism;innate immunity;mitoimmunity;invertebrate;mitochondrial toxicants;pesticides;GENE-EXPRESSION;INNATE IMMUNITY;ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS;MITOCHONDRIAL DYNAMICS;IN-VITRO;METABOLISM;NEMATODE;MODEL;MARINE;LIFE;Rotenone,NA,NA,rotenone modulates <i>caenorhabditis elegans<i> immunometabolism and pathogen susceptibility

In the present study it was analysed the hepatic levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in males and females of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus exposed to paraquat (PQ), at 17 and 27 degrees C. Tilapia were exposed to a sublethal concentration of PQ (0.5 mg L-1) during 45 days. Condition factor and hepatosomatic index of males and females exposed to PQ were significantly higher when compared with the control group, except in females at 17 degrees C. SOD and GST activities were higher in males and females exposed to PQ than in the control group at 17 and 27 degrees C. The levels of both enzyme activities revealed that they are sex-dependent with males exposed to PQ showing higher SOD activity (5.05 +/- 0.13 and 4.84 +/- 0.23 U/g protein, respectively at 17 and 27 degrees C) than females (4.21 +/- 0.07 and 3.87 +/- 0.27 U/g protein, respectively at the same temperature). Similar results were observed in GST activity. A GR activity significantly higher (9.09 +/- 0.44 and 7.97 +/- 1.08 U/g protein at 17 and 27 degrees C, respectively) was observed in PQ-exposed females, but not in exposed males. Fish exposed to PQ showed higher values of SOD and GST activities than the control group at both temperatures. These results are gender-dependent, while GR activity was higher only in PQ-exposed females. No significant differences were found for SOD, GST and GR activities between fish exposed to 17 and 27 'C, although males and females showed higher values at 17 'C. In short, this work advanced new knowledge on influence of gender in same biochemical parameters in tilapia exposed to PQ and demonstrated that their effects could be observed at different temperatures.

Although the molecular mechanism of neuronal PSP toxicity has been well studied, several issues remain unresolved, notably the in vivo hepatic antioxidative responses to this neurotoxin. Aphantoxins extracted from a natural isolate of A. flos-aquae DC-1 were resolved by high performance liquid chromatography. The primary components were gonyautoxins 1 and 5 and neosaxitoxin. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were treated intraperitoneally with either 53 or 7.61 (low and high doses, respectively) mu g saxitoxin (STX) equivalents (eq)/kg of A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins. Antioxidative responses in zebrafish liver were examined at different timepoints 1-24 h post-exposure. Aphantoxin administration significantly enhanced hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) content 1-12 h post-exposure, indicative of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. By contrast, levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) in zebrafish liver declined significantly after 3-24 h exposure, suggesting that GSH participates in MDA metabolism. A significant upregulation of the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was observed, suggesting that aphantoxins induce lipid peroxidation in zebrafish liver and are likely to be hepatotoxic. Hepatic levels of MDA and GSH, and of the three enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx), therefore provide potential biomarkers for studying environmental exposure to aphantoxins/PSPs from cyanobacterial blooms.

The purpose of this study was to understand the effects of the structural characteristics (concentration, duration, and frequency) of temporally and spatially variant contaminant plumes on the personality of individuals. This experimental design aimed to construct a sensitive definition of exposure by connecting sublethal effects of toxicants and realistic exposure regimes. This study used escape response of Faxonius virilis crayfish from the predatory odor of Micropterus saltnoides prior to and following exposure to the herbicide, atrazine. Atrazine was delivered in pulses to flow through exposure arenas for a total of 47 h while manipulating the concentration, frequency, and duration of the herbicide pulses. Escape response of crayfish prior to exposure was used to categorize animals into bold and shy personalities. The change in escape response was analyzed and resulted in a personality-dependent behavioral sensitivity to the polluted environment. Individuals classified as bold showed increased change in response to predatory odor relative to shy animals. Bold animals exhibited decreased activity after exposure where no change was presented in shy individuals. Shifts in individual behavior have impacts on the population level (e.g. resource acquisition/value; interspecies competition) and the ecosystem level (e.g. food web dynamics; trophic cascades).

rayyan-1227192379,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fipronil,2006,5,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,4,5,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Fipronil is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fipronil in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 10 February 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 15 July 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 7 February 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises seed dressing to control soil insects and wireworms in sunflower and maize at application rate up 30 g fipronil per hectare for sunflower (up to 500 g fipronil per 100 kg seeds) and up to 50 g per hectare for maize (up to 250 g per 100 kg seeds), respectively. It should be noted that due to the fact that the applicant has changed, some representative uses are not longer supported for the EU review by the new applicant. Fipronil can be used as insecticide and acaricide. It should be noted that during the peer review process the applicant stated that only the use as insecticide will be supported in the EU review programme.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Regent 500FS"" (""EXP80415A""), a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS), registered in some Member States of the EU. The WG-and the GB formulation (EXP60720A and EXP61840A, respectively) are not longer supported for the EU review process (i.e. with respect to Annex I inclusion) by the new applicant. However, the submitted data package was evaluated in the DAR, but the peer review was not completed.        Adequate methods to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition are available only for food and air. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-residue method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of fipronil.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Rapidly and extensively absorbed and distributed, fipronil may bioaccumulate but is readily metabolised, and slowly excreted via faeces. Fipronil is toxic by oral, inhalation and dermal acute exposure. It is slightly skin and eye irritating, and weakly sensitising, but not sufficiently to be classified. The proposed classification is T, R23/24/25 ""Toxic by inhalation, in contact with skin and if swallowed"".        Adverse effects in the short term studies are observed in the central nervous system, liver and thyroid. The proposed classification by ECB is T, R48/25 ""Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed"", to be voted in the 30th ATP. No genotoxic or carcinogenic potential is demonstrated. The mechanism for induction of thyroid tumours was discussed by the experts and considered rat specific and not relevant to humans.        Neither reproductive or developmental toxicity is observed. In specific neurotoxicity studies, no histopathological findings are observed in the nervous system.        The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0002 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.0035 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) 0.009 mg/kg bw, with a safety factor of 100.        As the use of the Seed Tropex model was considered not fully appropriate by the experts, the operator exposure was evaluated with a field study, resulting in an exposure below the AOEL without PPE. Worker exposure is 89% of the AOEL without PPE, for a 8-hour working day. Bystander exposure is not likely to be an issue for seed treatments and has to be addressed at Member State level.        The metabolism of fipronil has been investigated on five different crops representative for cereals, pulses and oilseed, roots and tubers using either soil applications or seed treatment. A common metabolic pathway could be defined for the three crop groups tested and a relevant metabolite (sulfone metabolite MB 46136) was demonstrated to be present. Even though there were concerns on an acutely toxic by oral administration photo degradation product of fipronil, MB 46513, the experts' meeting on residues concluded that the compound is basically not relevant in relation to seed treatment uses. However, a label restriction has been proposed to ensure that treated seed remains stored in the dark to prevent photo degradation processes. In supervised residue trails no residues of fipronil and of its sulfone metabolite were observed at harvest of maize grain and sunflower seed. Trials results are suitable to propose MRLs at LOQ level. Even though calculated animal intakes were well below the trigger of 0.1 mg/kg, there is a need to consider residues in animal products since fipronil is classified fat soluble and the ADI is very low. Based on the available livestock metabolism and feeding studies, MRLs for food of animal origin were proposed.        In a consumer risk assessment the TMDI was demonstrated to exceed the ADI for toddlers and infants, mainly due to the fact that milk consumption accounted for the most significant contribution of pesticide intake in terms of the total dietary assessment. However, in a refined chronic dietary risk assessment the IEDI/NEDI was below the ADI for all considered consumer groups (adults, toddles, infants) and thus, it is unlikely that exposure to fipronil and fipronil sulfone residues from seed treatment will pose a high chronic risk to consumers. In an acute dietary risk assessment the estimated exposure of all considered consumer groups was well below the proposed ARfD. Under laboratory aerobic conditions fipronil is moderate to high persistent in soil. Major metabolites are the amide RPA 200766(3), the sulphone MB 46136(4) and the sulphide MB 45950(5). Mineralization is very low.        Under dark aerobic conditions at metabolite RPA 20076(6) is high persistent, RPA 200761(6) moderate to high persistent, MB 45950 medium to high persistent, MB 46136 high persistent and MB 46513(7) moderate to medium persistent. Most of the measured half lives are longer than the duration of the studies and therefore uncertain.        Photolysis may contribute slightly to the environmental dissipation of fipronil in soil yielding two metabolites not previously detected in the dark aerobic degradation studies: MB 46513 (more acutely orally toxic than fipronil) and RPA 104615(8).        Available field studies confirmed that fipronil is medium to high persistent in soil when not exposed to light (soil incorporated). When exposed to light the toxic metabolite MB 46513 is detected. Two field accumulation studies were submitted by the applicant after the DAR was finalised. A clear tendency for accumulation of fipronil metabolites is demonstrated. Plateau for metabolites had not been reached after the five or six years of repeated applications. The PEC soil calculation submitted by the applicant after the DAR was finalised do not represents a worst case with respect to the parent compound. Furthermore, the assumptions taken in the calculation are not well justified. Calculation of the initial and 21 d TWA-PECS for the parent compound and soil metabolites are also needed to finalise the ecotoxicological risk assessment. According adsorption / desorption studies fipronil is low to medium mobile, MB 45950 and MB 46136 are immobile to low mobile, MB 46513 is low mobile and RPA 200766 is medium to high mobile.        Hydrolysis will not contribute to the degradation of fipronil in the environment. However, photolysis may contribute to the degradation of fipronil and its major metabolites in water. Fipronil is not readily biodegradable in water.        In water/sediment system fipronil is adsorbed on the sediment where degrades to MB 45950. In the water phase fipronil and the major metabolite RPA 200766 reached levels above 10 % AR.        PECSW/SED were provided by the applicant after the DAR was finalised. However, new calculations are needed with parameters updated following FOCUS guidance. New PECGW were provided by the applicant after the DAR had been finalized. Only the application rate of 50 g/ha for maize has been simulated. Results of these new calculations show that metabolite RPA 200766 exceeds the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L for five of the seven scenarios simulated. This metabolite has been assessed to be not toxicological relevant (see 2.8) but it is considered ecotoxicological relevant (see 5.2). Due to the deviations with respect to guidelines on the input parameters selection and the need of justification for the use of field kinetic parameters a data gap for new FOCUS PECGW calculation with appropriate input parameters has been identified.        Long range transport and deposition of fipronil may be considered negligible.        A high acute, short and long term risks to granivorous birds were identified in the first tier risk assessment for the representative use as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower. The risk to birds should focus on the acute and short term risk as there is no indication that fipronil is a reproductive toxin. A new risk assessment for granivorous birds taking into account the concerns raised at the EPCO 27 experts' meeting is required. The risk to small and large granivorous birds must be quantified. The current proposed extrapolation from maize to sunflowers is not acceptable.        Also for granivorous mammals a high acute and long term risk were identified in the first tier risk assessment for the representative use as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower. A revised risk assessment for granivorous mammals taking into account the concerns raised at EPCO 27 is required. The availability of treated seeds for mammals should be assessed to indicate whether mice consumed drilled maize and sunflower seeds. The risk to granivorous birds and mammals from the use of fipronil as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower can only be concluded once recently submitted data are evaluated.        The risk to herbivorous birds and mammals from the representative uses of fipronil as a seed dressing is considered to be low.        The risk to earthworm and fish-eating birds and mammals can be considered low based on the currently available PECs and PECsw-values. The risk to earthworm and fish eating birds and mammals from the representative uses with the FS formulation can not be concluded due to still open questions regarding the calculation of PEC in surface water and soil.        The risk to aquatic organisms is based on the most sensitive species, Mysidopsis bahia. If the applicant would like to pursue the argument that marine species are more sensitive than freshwater species then a more robust justification must be provided. The risk to aquatic organisms from the representative uses with the FS formulation can not be concluded due to still open questions regarding the calculation of PECsw values. Based on the available provisional PECsw values a high acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms was identified for the representative use as a seed treatment in maize. The risk to aquatic organisms for the representative use in sunflower can be regarded as low. The RMS proposed to refine the long term risk by using an endpoint for M. bahia from a study in the presence of sediment. The EFSA considers that in order to accept this refinement option, an assessment in line with the conclusion of the PPR Panel on dimoxystrobin should be presented. The experts' meeting agreed that it might be possible to reduce the standard uncertainty factor due to the number of species tested. The EFSA would like to refer to the opinion of the PPR Panel regarding the reduction of the uncertainty due to the availability of several single species studies and proposes to take this opinion into account at MS-level. Based on the present PECsw values the risk from the metabolites MB 46136, MB 45950 and RPA 200766 for the representative uses as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower can be regarded as low except for the long term risk to aquatic invertebrates from MB 46136 in maize. Also for the refinement of this risk the EFSA would like to refer to the opinion of the PPR Panel on the lowering of aquatic trigger values. The risk for bioaccumulation in fish from fipronil is considered to be low. The EFSA proposes that a study on bioaccumulation in fish from the metabolites MB 46136, MB 45950 and RPA 200766 should be submitted as the Log Pow of these metabolites exceeds 3.        A very high acute contact and oral toxicity of fipronil to bees were observed in the laboratory toxicity studies. The metabolite MB 46136 showed a similar toxicity to bees as fipronil and the metabolite RPA 200761 showed a lower toxicity to bees than fipronil. The EPCO experts' meeting considered the risk to adult bees for the representative uses as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower addressed based on the low exposure situation observed in monitoring studies and the observation of no adverse effects in the tunnel studies. The risk to bees can only be concluded once recently submitted data on the risk to bee brood are evaluated. Furthermore the EFSA would like to highlight that the available monitoring studies were mainly performed in France and MS should consider the relevance of these studies for the circumstances in their country.        A high toxicity to NTA was observed in the laboratory. The EPCO experts' meeting identified the need for a new risk assessment for soil dwelling arthropods taking into account final results from the ongoing aged residue studies on A. bilineata and F. candida. This assessment should cover the potential for recovery of impacted species in the field. Furthermore the meeting noted that the risk assessment should cover the plateau soil PEC for total residues (parent + metabolites). The risk to non-target arthropods from the representative uses with the FS formulation can only be concluded once recently submitted studies on A. bilineata and F. candida are evaluated and the open questions for the calculation of PECsoil have been solved.        The risk to soil macro-organisms can be considered low at a concentration of 0.785 mg a.s./kg soil and the risk to soil micro-organisms can be considered as low at a concentration of 0.667 mg a.s./kg soil for fipronil and 0.60, 0.133 and 0.267 mg/kg soil for MB 46136, MB 45950 and RPA 200766 respectively. The risk to soil non-target macro-and micro-organisms from the representative uses with the FS formulation can not be concluded due to still open questions regarding the calculation of PECsoil.        The risk to earthworms, non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is considered to be low.

Therefore, cross-species extrapolation is fundamental to environmental risk assessment. Recognition of the impracticality of generating empirical, whole organism, toxicity data for the extensive universe of chemicals in commerce has been an impetus driving the field of predictive toxicology. We describe a strategy that leverages expanding databases of molecular sequence information together with identification of specific molecular chemical targets whose perturbation can lead to adverse outcomes to support predictive species extrapolation. This approach can be used to predict which species may be more (or less) susceptible to effects following exposure to chemicals with known modes of action (e.g., pharmaceuticals, pesticides). Primary amino acid sequence alignments are combined with more detailed analyses of conserved functional domains to derive the predictions. This methodology employs bioinformatic approaches to automate, collate, and calculate quantitative metrics associated with cross-species sequence similarity of key molecular initiating events (MIEs). Case examples focused on the actions of (a) 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol on the human (Homo sapiens) estrogen receptor; (b) permethrin on the mosquito (Aedes aegypti)voltage-gated para-like sodium channel; and (c) 17 beta-trenbolone on the bovine (Bos taurus) androgen receptor are presented to demonstrate the potential predictive utility of this species extrapolation strategy. The examples compare empirical toxicity data to cross-species predictions of intrinsic susceptibility based on analyses of sequence similarity relevant to the MIEs of defined adverse outcome pathways. Through further refinement, and definition of appropriate domains of applicability, we envision practical and routine utility for the molecular target similarity-based predictive method in chemical risk assessment, particularly where testing resources are limited.

In this work we aimed to study the effects of deltamethrin, alone or in combination with azamethiphos, on the transcription of stress and detoxification marker genes. Atlantic salmon kept at 12 degrees C (one group was also kept at 4-5 degrees C) were treated with deltamethrin alone or in combination with azamethiphos for a total of 40 min, and gill and liver tissue harvested for transcriptional analysis 2 and 24 h post treatment. No lethality was observed during the experiment. The result showed that deltamethrin, alone or in combination with azamethiphos, affected the transcriptional levels of several oxidative stress markers, including MnSOD (SOD2) and HSP70 (HSPA8) in the liver, and GPX1, CAT, MnSOD, HSP70 and GSTP1 in the gills. Significant responses for CASP3B, BCLX, IGFBP1B and ATP1A1 (Na-K-ATPase a1b) by some of the treatments suggest that the pharmaceutical drugs may affect apoptosis, growth and ion regulation mechanisms. In fish kept at 4-5 degrees C, different effects were observed, suggesting a temperature-dependent response. In conclusion, the observed responses indicate that short-term exposure to deltamethrin has a profound effect on transcription of the evaluated markers in gills and liver of fish. Co-treatment with azamethiphos appears to have small mitigating effects on the transcriptional response caused by deltamethrin exposure alone.

Organisms were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of CPF (from 3.5 to 94.5 ng CPF L-1) at laboratory conditions for 96 h. A wide battery of biochemical responses including bioaccumulation, damage and defense biomarkers were measured in cephalothorax and abdomen of shrimp.        The concentration of CPF was below the detection limit of the method in both body sectors (8 ng CPFg(-1) ww), probably indicating fast biotransformation of the parental compound. Our results showed that CPF exposure inhibits acetylcholinesterase activity from 3.5 ng CPF L-1, a concentration below the suggested Argentinean guidelines for the protection of aquatic biota. Moreover, oxidative stress was evidenced by increased H2O2 content and increased levels of TBARs and carbonyl groups in proteins. The induction of antioxidant enzymes like catalase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase seems not be sufficient to prevent oxidative damages. In addition, the mobilization of alpha-tocopherol from abdomen to cephalothorax was observed and reported for the first time in non-reproductive condition. Likewise, a strong diminution of metallothioneins occurred in cephalothorax from the lowest CPF concentration while induction occurred from the same treatment in abdomen as an oxidative stress response. Finally, significant correlation between Integrated Biomarker Response values and exposure concentrations suggest the usefulness of P. argentinus as bioindicator of CPF exposure at concentrations as low as environmental ones.

The crabs were exposed to three sublethal concentrations in a pulse system with controlled dilutions. Water samples for pesticide concentrations measurements and crab tissue samples were taken when applications were made and 2, 8, 15 and 22 days after administering the pesticide. The exposure to endosulfan caused an increase in B cell number and a decrease in F and R cell number (p <0.05). Necrotic tubules, abnormal lumen and other histopathologies were observed in the hepatopancreas of crabs exposed to endosulfan. There was an increase in the proportion of collapsed gills caused by endosulfan effects. Other effects as hyperplasia were also observed. There were no changes in the gonadosomatic index of exposed crabs; however there were changes in the volume of oocytes of exposed crabs in certain days (p < 0.05). The increase in B cell number and the consequent reduction in F cell number may be related to the detoxification processes. The changes in cell number within the hepatopancreas and the histopathologies observed both in hepatopancreas and gills might be used as endosulfan exposure indicators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A factor affecting male reproductive output is exposure to contaminants that either disrupt endocrine function or mimic hormones. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) persist in aquatic ecosystems and may interfere with the reproductive contribution of male fish to populations. We quantified 28 PCB congeners in adult male bluegills across eight Illinois lakes. In spring 2011 and 2012, mature male bluegills from lakes with conspecifics with PCB whole-body residues ranging from undetectable to high (2,000 ng/g dry mass total PCBs) were placed in experimental ponds with mature females containing no detectable PCB body residues and allowed to reproduce in spring under natural conditions. The presence of PCBs in fish had no effect on the presence of intersex or other gonadal deformities in adult males nor was gonad size, lipid concentration, and survival affected. Males with high PCBs were heavier than those from lakes with low PCB concentrations. The relative density of juvenile bluegills produced in ponds by fall, a fitness endpoint in this species, was negatively related to contaminant concentration in fathers. Contaminant exposure and other factors that affect male reproduction may not only suppress the relative contribution of males to genetic diversity, but also the overall density of cohorts within populations.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  37,10.1890/ES14-00391.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),bluegills;contaminants;endocrine disruption;Lepomis macrochirus;male reproductive output;polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs);reproductive success;FISH RECRUITMENT;POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS;TEMPORAL DIMENSION;PARENTAL CARE;BODY-SIZE;BLUEGILL;ORGANOCHLORINES;DISRUPTION;PREDATION;SURVIVAL,NA,NA,contaminants reduce male contribution to reproduction at the population scale

rayyan-1227192392,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance diazinon,2006,8,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,4,8,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Diazinon is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Portugal being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on diazinon in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 8 July 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 9 September 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Makhteshim Agan. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6-7 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses in Southern Europe as an insecticide and acaricide as proposed by the applicant with application via orchard air blast sprayers and tractor mounted hydraulic sprayers. Application is made to apples and pears with a maximum total dose of 2.7 kg diazinon per hectare and to sugar beet with a maximum total dose of 0.72 kg diazinon per hectare. It should be noted that the use in apples and pears were withdrawn during the EU peer review process. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Diazol 60 EC, an emulsifiable concentrate (EC).        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. However, it should be noted that full validation of the method of analysis for food commodities is not available as no independent laboratory validation data are available. As well as this further validation data are required for the method of analysis for air.        Some analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are still some outstanding data gaps for the relevant impurities.        Acute toxicity during oral exposure is higher than by dermal application or inhalation. Therefore the proposed classification is Xn; R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"". The main effect observed during short term or long term exposure is the inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase activity. Based on this, the relevant oral short term NOAEL is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day in the dog studies.        There is no genotoxic potential for diazinon, no carcinogenic effect in rats and mice, and no reproductive or developmental toxicity in rats and rabbits. No delayed neurotoxicity was observed in hens, and the NOAEL in the subchronic neurotoxicity study with rats is the same as the short term NOAEL, based on acetyl cholinesterase inhibition. The groundwater metabolites G 27550(3) and GS 31144(4) are not considered toxicologically significant, having no phosphate group susceptible to produce acetyl cholinesterase inhibition. They were concluded not relevant. The three impurities TEPP5, O, S-TEP6 and S, S-TEPP7 were very toxic in acute oral studies and considered of toxicological concern. Acute and subchronic human studies were submitted, but were either not acceptable, or had scientific deficiencies.        The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.0002 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.025 mg/kg bw, with the use of the safety factor 100. For the supported use on sugar beets, the estimated operator exposure according to the German or the UK models is largely above the AOEL, with or without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) (2700% of the AOEL with the use of PPE and respiratory protective equipment (RPE) according to the German model).        The metabolism of diazinon in plants is clearly elucidated. The degradation pathway proceeds first through hydrolysis of the phosphorothioate ester link, leading to metabolite G 27550, which given its chemical structure has no cholinesterase activity. This compound is further hydroxylated and conjugated to glucose. Diazoxon is not observed. The amount of metabolites in comparison to the parent level is variable from crop to crop, but the residue definition can be restricted to parent compound only for monitoring and risk assessment as no other compound expected to add a contribution to the toxicological effects of diazinon was identified. Supervised residue trials were conducted suggesting the setting of a MRL at 0.5 mg/kg in pome fruits, and indicating that residues in sugar beet roots are below 0.01 mg/kg. No residues are expected in following crops and no plant- back restriction is needed.        Processing of apples leads to a clear reduction of the diazinon levels in juice and sauce. However, the formation of a degradation product (desethyl diazinon), identified under specific hydrolysis conditions, was not investigated in practical conditions. This compound is recommended for inclusion in the residue definition for risk assessment in processed commodities.        The metabolism of diazinon in livestock has been investigated and parent compound was found to be the major compound of toxicological relevance in animal tissues. Diazinon exhibits a lipophilic behaviour. Two metabolites, diazoxon and a hydroxylated form of diazinon were also present. The residue definition in animal commodities can be restricted to diazinon on the basis of the representative uses considered in this peer-review, leading to a low livestock dietary exposure and non significant transfer of residues to animal tissues, as demonstrated by feeding studies.        The short and long term exposure assessments were conducted and indicated potential exceedences of the ADI and ARfD, which in some cases appear to be severe, in particular for infants and toddlers, with high consumption levels of pome fruits.        In soil diazinon exhibited low to moderate persistence. Significant sinks for the pyridine ring-C-14-radiolabel used in the aerobic laboratory studies were residue not extracted by acetonitrile: water or methanol/water (9-38% of applied radioactivity (AR) after 76-119 days) and mineralisation to CO2 5.8-86% AR at 76-119 days. The major (>10% AR) metabolite in soil extracts was G 27550 accounting for up to 82% AR which exhibited high soil persistence. This metabolite may have the potential to accumulate in soil if applications are made to the same field in successive years. Diazinon exhibited medium to low soil mobility and G 27550 exhibited very high mobility based on the results of guideline batch laboratory adsorption experiments. The minor soil degradation product (max. 4.7% AR) GS 31144 was also characterised as exhibiting very high soil mobility on the basis of quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) computer modelling.        In aerobic laboratory natural sediment water system experiments, diazinon exhibited low persistence (dissipation DT50 in water 3.9-4.7 days) as a consequence of a combination of partitioning to sediment (accounting for up to 77%AR at 0 days) and biodegradation. In the water phase the metabolite G 27550 accounted for a maximum of 47%AR 30 days after application, levels subsequently declined (DT50 in water estimated at 87 days). G 27550 was also present in sediment (maximum 22.7%AR). Residues not extracted from sediment by acetonitrile and acetonitrile: water represented 22-49%AR at study end (100 days). Mineralisation to CO2 of the pyridine ring-C-14-radiolabel used accounted for only 4.7-5.1 % AR by 100 days. The available surface water exposure assessment just considered the spray drift route of entry to surface water. The potential exposure of surface water with parent diazinon and the soil metabolite G 27550 via the drainage and runoff routes of entry has not been assessed in the available EU level exposure assessment. Member States should therefore carry out a surface water exposure and consequent aquatic risk assessment for diazinon and G 27550 from the runoff and drainage routes of exposure at the national level, should diazinon be included in Annex 1.        Appropriate FOCUS groundwater modelling is not available. This is required. Based on the available FOCUS PEARL modelling that utilised too favourable input parameters, annual average recharge concentrations leaving the top 1m soil column >0.75 mu g/L are already indicated for G 27550. For GS 31144 these concentrations are indicated to be >0.1 mu g/L. Based on current information it cannot be excluded that these concentrations for GS 31144 may be shown by appropriate modelling to be >0.75 mu g/L. Non relevance assessments are therefore required for both these potential groundwater contaminants. A significant dissipation route of diazinon from plants and soil will be volatilisation to the atmosphere. However calculated relatively rapid photooxidation through reaction with the hydroxyl radicals present in the upper atmosphere, indicate that diazinon is unlikely to be subject to long range atmospheric transport.        A high acute, short and long term risk for insectivorous birds was identified in the first tier assessment for both evaluated uses. Based on actual measured concentrations of diazinon and degradation of residues in orchards the short and long term risk in apples/pears is considered low. However, the high acute risk remains. For sugar beet no valid residue data are available to refine the assessment. A high long term risk to insectivorous mammals was identified in both sugar beet and orchards. A risk for secondary poisoning was identified for earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals for the use in orchards and for earthworm-eating mammals for the use in sugar beet. Diazinon is very toxic to aquatic organisms. Risk mitigation measures comparable to 30 m buffer zones are required in orchards, and to 5 m in sugar beet. The toxicity to bees is high. Sugar beet is however not attractive to bees and application in orchards is late in the season after flowering. The risk to bees is therefore considered to be low. Non-target arthropods outside the field would be affected from the treatment in orchards. A potential for recolonisation has been shown in an aged residue study. However, a prerequisite for recolonisation from off-field non-target arthropod populations is that off-field populations are not affected. Therefore the risk to off-field non-target arthropods needs to be further addressed for the use in orchards. The acute risk to earthworms from diazinon and the soil metabolites is low and long term studies are not considered necessary. However, the risk to earthworms and other soil macro-organisms from the more persistent metabolite G 27550 needs to be addressed for a full conclusion. The risk to soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.

Beginning with a genetic radiation in reptiles roughly 200 million years ago, terrestrial vertebrates can detect millions of odorants. Each species has an olfactory repertoire unique to the genetic makeup of that species. The human olfactory repertoire is quite diverse. Contrary to erroneously reported estimates, humans can detect millions of airborne odorants (volatiles) in quite small concentrations. We exhibit tremendous variation in our genes that control the receptors in our olfactory epithelium, and this may relate to variation in cross-cultural perception of and preference for odors. With age, humans experience differential olfactory dysfunction, with some odors remaining strong and others becoming increasingly faint. Olfactory dysfunction has been pathologically linked to depression and quality of life issues, neurodegenerative disorders, adult and childhood obesity, and decreased nutrition in elderly females. Human pheromones, a controversial subject, seem to be a natural phenomenon, with a small number identified in clinical studies. The consumer product industry (perfumes, food and beverage, and pesticides) devotes billions of dollars each year supporting olfactory research in an effort to enhance product design and marketing. With so many intersecting areas of research, anthropology has a tremendous contribution to make to this growing body of work that crosses traditional disciplinary lines and has a clear applied component. Also, anthropology could benefit from considering the power of the olfactory system in memory, behavioral and social cues, evolutionary history, mate choice, food decisions, and overall health.

One hundred and twenty females (1.55 +/- 0.07 g) were fed during 8 days with (n = 60) or without (n = 60) a LA enriched ration (6000 mg/kg). Four experimental groups were defined: -LA/-Endo; +LA/-Endo; -LA/+Endo; and +LA/+Endo. Endo groups were exposed during 24 h to 1.4 mu g of insecticide/L. Results showed that only LA induced a significant increment in liver Pgp expression. GST activity was augmented in liver after exposure to LA or Endo. TBARS levels were lowered in liver and gills after LA pre-treatment. Total antioxidant capacity was lowered in liver of Endo exposed fish, a result that was reversed by LA pre-treatment. It is concluded that LA induced the expected effects in terms of Pgp expression, GST activity and reduced TBARS levels although favored alpha-Endo accumulation in brain.

Interestingly, tilapia fish treated with carbofuran (0.246 mg/L) and fed (0.5 and 1 g/kg diet) allicin in both the 4th & 5th groups, respectively, decreased serum biochemical parameters; and hepatorenal (MDA) levels, as well as increased AChE, immunological profile, and oxidative stress biomarkers. The results suggested that co- administration of allicin at the high dose is more capable of improving the biochemical, and immunological parameters, and tissue antioxidant responses of carbofuran treated fish. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 76; Correspondence Address: C.

The public's perception of risk from pollution is a fundamental component in determining consumer behavior and promoting healthy habits. For instance, understanding how consumers perceive the risks associated with pollution can help with adoption of safe behaviors to reduce the health hazard associated with pollutant exposure. This study focused on the southeastern United States, a region predicted to be exposed to high mercury stress by increasing mercury deposition and methylation. First, we placed our study region in the world map of regions more prone to suffer from increasing mercury stress in a climate change scenario. Second, mercury levels in fish tissues was quantified by direct mercury analyzer (DMA). Third, we explored human fish consumption habits and risk social perception, including willingness to adapt fish consumption based on two future hypothetical scenarios of mercury stress. From a global perspective, our analysis demonstrates that the southern US is one of five world areas of greatest conservation concern for mercury stress. In this region, the average mono-methyl mercury concentration in fish tissues exceeded the limits considered safe for human consumption. Even though many in the local population were aware of the health hazards associated with fish consumption, only women of reproductive age were willing to adopt safe consumption habits. Altogether, these results show how bringing together field data, social perceptions, and consumption habits can help in designing an adaptive strategy to confront mercury pollution. Although our results are for the United States, other world regions prone to suffer increasing mercury stress have been identified and should be the focus of future studies and prescriptions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 17; Correspondence Address: N.
