Specific test guidelines for the detection of EDCs used for short-term fish screening assays have been developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Compared to the core species used in the OECD guidelines, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) has an additional and unique endpoint for (anti-)androgenic substances through the androgen-dependent glue protein (spiggin) used in the nest building. Here we describe a specific behavioural assay that was developed in parallel to the OECD protocol, utilising unique behavioural features of sticklebacks. In the assay, a photoperiod of 16L:8D (light:dark) and a temperature of 17 +/- 1 degrees C was used to induce breeding in quiescent male sticklebacks that were simultaneously exposed for a 21-day period to the mammalian anti-androgen flutamide (FL) at 100, 500 and 1000 mu g/l (plus a water control). Spiggin production and the reproductive behaviour (nest building and courtship) of male sticklebacks were the main measured endpoints. The control fish entered an active breeding cycle including nest building and courtship behaviours as expected due to the stimulating temperature and photoperiodic conditions. The FL-exposed males showed significantly lower spiggin levels at 500 and 1000 mu g/l. In addition, there was a significant decrease in the number of nests built by the FL-treated males at 100 mu g/l with no nest built at 500 and 1000 mu g/l. Finally, FL affected the courtship behaviour of the males with a significant reduction of the number of zigzags towards the female. When the breeding status of the stickleback males is controlled, the behavioural assay developed here is a suitable tool for the detection of androgen antagonists.

However, fewer aquatic toxicological data on the effects of 17 alpha-estradiol, a diastereoisomer of 17 beta-estradiol, exists in the literature even though it has been found in the aquatic environment, sometimes at higher concentrations than 17 beta-estradiol. The central objective of this study was to determine how the anatomical, physiological, and behavioral effects of exposure to 17 alpha-estradiol compare to the well-documented effects of 17 beta-estradiol exposures in aquatic vertebrates. A 21-day flow-through exposure of mature male and female fathead minnows to three concentrations each of 17 alpha- and 17 beta-estradiol (averaged measured concentrations 27, 72, and 150 ng/L for 17 alpha-estradiol, and 9, 20, and 44 ng/L for beta-estradiol, respectively) yielded significant, concentration-dependent differences in plasma vitellogenin concentrations among estradiol-exposed males when compared to fish from an ethanol carrier control. Interstitial cell prominence in the testis of fish was elevated in all estradiol treatments. Aggressiveness of male fish to defend nest sites appeared depressed in many of the higher concentration estradiol treatments (albeit not significantly). No clear effects were observed in female fish. Based on plasma vitellogenin data, it appears that 17 beta-estradiol is 8-9 times more potent than 17 alpha-estradiol and that the lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC) for 17 alpha-estradiol in fathead minnows is greater than 25 ng/L and may be less than 75 ng/L.

This study reports the fate of a technical mixture of secondary and tertiary isomers of the environmental contaminant 4-nonylphenol (NP) in mature female roach. Fish were exposed to a concentration of 4.9 mug/l radio-labelled technical NP over a 4-day period in a flow-through aquarium. NP residues were extracted from all tissues and analysed by reverse phase radio HPLC. The concentration of NP residues was highest in bile and liver, with apparent bioconcentration factors (apparent BCFs) of 34,121 and 605, respectively. In other tissues, apparent BCF values were recorded between 13 and 250. NP was the only residue detected in brain, muscle and blood cells whereas an additional NP derivative was detected in other soft tissues, including gonads and liver, which was identified as the brominated derivative of technical NP, dibromo-4-nonylphenol. Traces of the dibrominated NP were also detected in aquarium water but only in the presence of NP, which suggested that bromination of the NP parent compound occurred in situ in the water due to the presence of trace amounts of oxidised bromine species in municipal water following disinfection. There was no evidence of further metabolism of the brominated derivative in roach, but a single major metabolite of NP was present in liver and bile, which was identified as the glucuronide conjugate of 4-(hydroxy-nonyl)-phenol. This detection of only one NP metabolite suggests that, in contrast to other fish species, the variety of metabolic pathways available for the deactivation of 4-alkylphenols in roach is limited. This study indicates that brominated alkylphenols bioconcentrate in a range of tissues and, as they have been detected in the aquatic environment, they could contribute to the body burden of alkylphenolics in fish. The formation of these brominated derivatives in aquarium water suggest that they could confound toxicity tests to assess the effects of alkyphenols to aquatic organisms. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the study of the effects of effluent exposure on organisms, populations or communities within the framework of impact assessment has a high ecological relevance. The aim of this study was to assess the toxicological impact of two effluents, one household wastewater treatment effluent (Effluent 1) and one industrial effluent (Effluent 2), on the receiving aquatic ecosystem using two test species under both in situ and laboratory conditions. Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were exposed under laboratory conditions in an online monitoring flow-through system (receiving different concentrations of Effluent 2) and under in situ conditions along the pollution gradient established by these two effluent discharges. Bioassays focussed on growth and condition related endpoints (i.e. condition, growth, lipid budget), since these are key functional processes within organisms and populations. Under laboratory conditions, increasing concentrations of the industrial effluent (Effluent 2) had a negative effect on both zebra mussel and carp energy reserves and condition. Under in situ conditions, the same negative impact of Effluent 2 was observed for zebra mussels, while Effluent I had no apparent effect on exposed zebra mussels. Carp growth and condition, on the other hand, were significantly increased at the discharge sites of both effluents when compared to the reference site, probably due to differences in food availability. The results indicate that a combination of in situ and laboratory exposures can illustrate how ecological processes influence bioassay studies. The incorporation of indirect, ecological effects, like changes in food availability, provides considerable benefit in understanding and predicting effects of effluents on selected species under realistic exposure conditions.

At site 6, androgen levels were approximately half those found at site 3, and estrogen levels were comparable with those at site 3. Sampling in later years was limited to fewer sites because of drought and lack of permission to access one site.

Population density can also influence mating behaviour and may interact with the operational sex ratio. We investigated the effects of both density and operational sex ratio on male territoriality and female oviposition in the zebrafish. We manipulated the sex bias in favour of either males or females at two density levels and measured the impact on females of aggression and courtship behaviour by territorial males in terms of egg production. Total egg production increased as a function of the number of females in each of the four treatments. However, mean per capita egg production was lower at high densities. We propose that this effect was due to increased aggression at high densities by territorial males towards rivals, which interrupted female spawning attempts. At high densities, territorial males maintained high rates of aggression regardless of sex bias, but courtship rates were significantly lower in male-biased treatments. We further propose that this response, whereby males constrain courtship in the presence of potential rivals, may be adaptive in the context of sperm competition avoidance.

For example, the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 defines EDC as those, that ""may have an effect in humans that is similar to an effect produced by a naturally occurring estrogen, or other such endocrine effect as the Administrator may designate."" The definition of EDC was later expanded to include those that act on the estrogen, androgen, and thyroid hormone receptors. In this minireview, we discuss new avenues through which xenobiotic chemicals influence these and other hormone-dependent signaling pathways. EDC can increase or block the metabolism of naturally occurring steroid hormones and other xenobiotic chemicals by activating or antagonizing nuclear hormone receptors. EDC affect the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors by modulating proteasome-mediated degradation of nuclear receptors and their coregulators. Xenobiotics and environmental contaminants can act as hormone sensitizers by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity and stimulating mitogenactivated protein kinase activity. Some endocrine disrupters can have genome-wide effects on DNA methylation status. Others can modulate lipid metabolism and adipogenesis, perhaps contributing to the current epidemic of obesity.

In this investigation, the effect of exposure to three WwTW effluents, with differing levels of estrogenic activity,was assessed on egg production in pair-breeding fathead minnow. Exposure to two of the three effluents tested resulted in a reduced egg production (by 28% for effluent I at a dilution of 50% and by 44% for effluent III at full strength), which was proportional to the estrogenic content of the effluents. The test effluents, however, had a greater effect on egg production than might be expected, on the basis of both the response they induced for induction of vitellogenin (an estrogen exposure biomarker) and when compared with an equivalent estrogen exposure to EE2. These data show that reliance on relatively simple biomarker responses for estrogenic activity alone, such as vitellogenin, can significantly underestimate the impacts of estrogenic WwTW effluents on fitness parameters such as reproductive health that are regulated by more complex estrogenic (and other endocrine) signaling mechanisms.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  70     Total Times Cited:  80     Cited Reference Count:  38,10.1021/es803103c     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),MINNOW PIMEPHALES-PROMELAS;ROACH RUTILUS-RUTILUS;ENDOCRINE-DISRUPTING CHEMICALS;LONG-TERM EXPOSURE;FATHEAD MINNOW;ENVIRONMENTAL CONCENTRATIONS;REPRODUCTIVE-PERFORMANCE;SYNTHETIC ESTROGEN;SEXUAL DISRUPTION;LIFE-CYCLE;Ovum,NA,NA,estrogenic wastewater treatment works effluents reduce egg production in fish

Concentration-response curves for fixed ratio binary mixtures of E2 and NP (1:1000), E2 and MXC (1: 1000), and NP and MXC (1:1) were compared to those obtained for the individual chemicals, using the model of concentration addition. Mixtures of E2 and NP were additive at the concentrations tested, but mixtures of E2 and MXC were less than additive. This suggests that while NP probably acts via the same mechanism as E2 in inducing VTG synthesis, MXC may be acting via a different mechanism(s), possibly as a result of its conversion to HPTE which is an estrogen receptor alpha agonist and an estrogen receptor beta antagonist. It was not possible to determine whether mixtures of MXC and NP were additive using VTG induction, because the toxicity of MXC restricted the effect range for which the expected response curve for the binary mixture could be calculated. The data presented illustrate that the model of concentration addition can accurately predict effects on VTG induction, where we know that both chemicals act via the same mechanism in mediating a vitellogenic response.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  206     Total Times Cited:  237     Cited Reference Count:  27,10.1021/es001767u     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),RECEPTORS;CHEMICALS;METHOXYCHLOR;ESTRADIOL;TOXICITY;EFFLUENT;RIVERS;FISH;Estrogens,NA,NA,assessing the biological potency of binary mixtures of environmental estrogens using vitellogenin induction in juvenile rainbow trout <i>oncorhynchus mykiss<i>

Despite numerous efforts, very little is known about the mechanism of zebrafish sex determination. The lack of discernible sex chromosomes and the difficulty of distinguishing the sex of juvenile fish are two major obstacles that hamper the progress in such studies. To alleviate these problems, we have developed a scheme involving methyltestosterone treatment followed by natural mating to generate fish with predictable sex trait. Female F1 fish that gave rise to all-female offspring were generated. This predictable sex trait enables characterization of gonadal development in juvenile fish by histological examination and gene expression analysis. We found the first sign of zebrafish sex differentiation to be ovarian gonocyte proliferation and differentiation at 10 to 12 days post-fertilization (dpf). Somatic genes were expressed indifferently at 10 to 17 dpf, and then became sexually dimorphic at three weeks. This result indicates clear distinction of male and female gonads derived independently from primordial gonads. We classified the earliest stages of zebrafish sex determination into the initial preparation followed by female germ cell growth, oocyte differentiation, and somatic differentiation. Our genetic selection scheme matches the prediction that female-dominant genetic factors are required to determine zebrafish sex. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

They serve for escape and predation and are therefore ecologically important movements. Fast starts are generated by glycolytic muscle performance and are influenced by many internal and external factors. It is known that ammonia pollution has a major effect on the glycolytic muscle action, thus creating conditions in which fast start performance might be reduced and predation rates altered. Therefore, escape response and predation strikes were investigated in brown trout (Salmo trutta) of 10 and 20 cm body length exposed to an elevated (1 mg l(-1)) ammonia concentration for 24 and 96 h. Various locomotor and behavioural variables were measured. In C-starts, i.e. an escape start where the fish bends into a C-shaped position, ammonia exposure had no effect on response latency. After 96 h of exposure, cumulative distance, maximum swimming speed and turning radius of the prey were all significantly reduced and the escape went in no definite direction. The effect of ammonia exposure was more pronounced in large fish than in small fish. Predation strikes were also affected. Distance, speed and turning radius were significantly lower in exposed fish. Agonistic behaviour of dominant fish was significantly reduced and fish spent more time resting. Predator behaviour was also altered and the number of prey captured was reduced.        This study shows that ammonia exposure affects brown trout escape response mainly through a reduction in fast start velocity and through an impairment of directionality. Thus, in addition to a reduced strength of the response, ammonia exposure could also reduce the fish's elusiveness facing a predator. Predation rate and social interactions are disrupted and predator-prey relationships could be altered. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Influents and effluents from four UK sewage treatment works (STWs), and bile of effluent-exposed fish, were screened for six equine estrogens.

Adult zebrafish were semistatically exposed to nominal concentrations of 0, 10, and 25 ng/L EE2 for 24 d and then transferred to EE2-free medium. Gonadosomatic index (GSI), plasma vitellogenin concentration (VTG), and histology of the gonads (control and 10 ng/L only) were examined as a function of time. It was found that EE2 has an adverse impact on both male and female reproductive organs. Notably in females, gonadal changes were observed through histological evaluation after 3 d of exposure to 10 ng/L EE2, and this was followed by a reduction of GSI at day 6 of exposure. In males, a reduction of GSI and altered testis histology was found after 24 d of exposure to 10 ng/L. The observed effects on the ovary after EE2 exposure, combined with complete recovery after 24 d is considered to be triggered by feedback at the level of the pituitary. In both males and females, VTG was induced in response to EE2 and normalized during the recovery period. The observed correlation between VTG and ovarian somatic index (OSI) demonstrates that excessive VTG induction may be predictive for adverse effects of EE2 on ovarian function in female zebrafish. These results indicate that long-term stimulation by synthetic estrogens such as EE2 might impair reproductive function in zebrafish in a reversible manner.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  161     Total Times Cited:  183     Cited Reference Count:  36,10.1002/etc.5620210412     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ethynytestradiol;reproduction;zebrafish;time dependency;reversibility;MINNOWS PIMEPHALES-PROMELAS;ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION;ESTROGENIC ACTIVITY;EXPOSURE;CHEMICALS;17-BETA-ESTRADIOL;VITELLOGENIN;INDUCTION;BIOMARKER;STEROIDS,NA,NA,effects of ethynylestradiol on the reproductive physiology in zebrafish <i>danio rerio<i> time dependency and reversibility

Fish bioaccumulation markers may be applied in order to elucidate the aquatic behavior of environmental contaminants, as bioconcentrators to identify certain substances with low water levels and to assess exposure of aquatic organisms. Since it is virtually impossible to predict the fate of xenobiotic substances with simple partitioning models, the complexity of bioaccumulation should be considered, including toxicokinetics, metabolism, biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs), organ-specific bioaccumulation and bound residues. Since it remains hard to accurately predict bioaccumulation in fish, even with highly sophisticated models, analyses or tissue levels are required. The most promising fish bioaccumulation markers are body burdens of persistent organic pollutants, like PCBs and DDTs. Since PCDD and PCDF levels in fish tissues are very low as compared with the sediment levels, their value as bioaccumulation markers remains questionable. Easily biodegradable compounds, such as PAHs and chlorinated phenols, do not tend to accumulate in Fish tissues in quantities that reflect the exposure. Semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) have been successfully used to mimic bioaccumulation of hydrophobic organic substances in aquatic organisms. In order to assess exposure to or effects of environmental pollutants on aquatic ecosystems, the following suite of fish biomarkers may be examined: biotransformation enzymes (phase I and II), oxidative stress parameters. biotransformation products, stress proteins, metallothioneins (MTs), MXR proteins. hematological parameters, immunological parameters, reproductive and endocrine parameters, genotoxic parameters, neurornuscular parameters, physiological, histological and morphological parameters. All fish biomarkers are evaluated for their potential use in ERA programs, based upon six criteria that hake been proposed in the present paper. This evaluation demonstrates that phase I enzymes (e.g. hepatic EROD and CYP1A), biotransformation products (e.g. biliary PAH metabolites), reproductive parameters (e.g. plasma VTG) and genotoxic parameters (e.g. hepatic DNA adducts) are currently the most valuable fish biomarkers for ERA. The use of biomonitoring methods in the control strategies for chemical pollution has several advantages over chemical monitoring. Many of the biological measurements form the only way of integrating effects on a large number of individual and interactive processes in aquatic organisms. Moreover, biological and biochemical effects may link the bioavailability of the compounds of interest with their concentration at target organs and intrinsic toxicity. The limitations of biomonitoring, such as confounding factors that are not related to pollution, should be carefully considered when interpreting biomarker data. Based upon this overview there is little doubt that measurements of bioaccumulation and biomarker responses in fish from contaminated sites offer great promises for providing information that can contribute to environmental monitoring programs designed for various aspects of ERA.

The 2 led to the disappearance of vitellogenic oocytes in the ovary and an increased area of relatively large, eosinophilic cells in the testis, which were identified as spermatogonia under high-power magnification; this was a relative increase, as was shown by histomorphometry, because of a decreased size of spermatogenic cysts and a relative decrease of spermatocyte cysts. The E-2 also induced an accumulation of acidophilic fluid in vessels and interstitial spaces, confirmed by immunohistochemistry as vitellogenin, and basophilia in the liver also associated with the production of vitellogenin. The MDHT induced activation of Sertoli cells in the testis and a decreased presence of vitellogenic oocytes and a reduced growth of previtellogenic oocytes in the ovary.

Survival, hatching, length, weight, growth, condition, hepatosomatic index, gonadosomatic index, and vitellogenin (VTG) production were examined. Exposure of zebrafish juveniles and embryos to 100 ng EE2/L for up to 33 days had significant effects on survival, growth, and hatching. Two VTG fragments with molecular weights of approximately 140 and 170 kDa were detected with protein electrophoresis and Western blotting in the blood of exposed males and exposed and unexposed females, as well as in whole-body homogenates of exposed and unexposed juveniles. Significantly higher VTG concentrations (compared to controls) were measured in adults exposed to 10 and 100 ng EE2/L for 14 days, but not in fish exposed to 1 ng EE2/L.

The effects of analog E were also observed in mature males. Female spawning behavior was induced by intramuscular injection of females with prostaglandin F2 alpha and placing them in the presence of mature males. Behavioral responses were quantified by recording the numbers of spawning acts performed by each pair of fish for 2 h following brain intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of different dosages of peptide or saline as control. For males, the time spent courting the female was recorded. Each pair of fish was pretested to determine their level of spawning behavior, for comparison to spawning behavior following icy treatment. icy injection of analog E caused a significant decrease in the number of spawning acts performed by females, suggesting a role of endogenous GnRH in modulating female spawning behavior. icy injection of 0.5 ng/g of sGnRH or cGnRH-II significantly stimulated female spawning behavior, whereas doses of 1 ng/g and higher resulted in an almost complete inhibition of spawning, reflecting a down-regulation as a result of the excessive dosages. Analog E suppressed the actions of exogenous sGnRH and cGnRH-II on spawning behavior, as both the sGnRH- and cGnRH-II-induced increases in the number of spawning acts were inhibited by concomitant treatment with analog E. Analog E-injected males showed no alteration in courtship behavior. These results indicate that GnRH peptides play a major role in the control of female reproductive behavior in goldfish, but have little or no role in the control of male behavior.

Treatment with ICI 182,780 also attenuated the estrogenic effects of tamoxifen on food intake, body weight and composition, linear growth, and uterine weight. These findings support the concept that, in addition to its actions in the brain, estradiol can act peripherally to modulate regulatory behaviors, energy balance, and estrous behavior.

There is an expanding body of evidence that anthropogenic chemicals exert effects on neuroendocrine systems and that these changesmight impact peripheral organ systems and physiological processes. Neuroendocrine disruption extends the concept of endocrine disruption to include the full breadth of integrative physiology (i.e., more than hormones are upset). Pollutants may also disrupt numerous other neurochemical pathways to affect an animal's capacity to reproduce, develop and grow, or deal with stress and other challenges. Several examples are presented in this review, from both vertebrates and invertebrates, illustrating that diverse environmental pollutants including pharmaceuticals, organochlorine pesticides, and industrial contaminants have the potential to disrupt neuroendocrine control mechanisms. While most investigations on EDC are carried out with vertebrate models, an attempt is also made to highlight the importance of research on invertebrate neuroendocrine disruption. The neurophysiology of many invertebrates is well described and many of their neurotransmitters are similar or identical to those in vertebrates; therefore, lessons learned from one group of organisms may help us understand potential adverse effects in others. This review argues for the adoption of systems biology and integrative physiology to address the effects of EDC. Effects of pulp and paper mill effluents on fish reproduction are a good example of where relatively narrow hypothesis testing strategies (e. g., whether or not pollutants are sex steroid mimics) have only partially solved a major problem in environmental biology. It is clear that a global, integrative physiological approach, including improved understanding of neuroendocrine control mechanisms, is warranted to fully understand the impacts of pulp and paper mill effluents. Neuroendocrine disruptors are defined as pollutants in the environment that are capable of acting as agonists/antagonists or modulators of the synthesis and/or metabolism of neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, or neurohormones, which subsequently alter diverse physiological, behavioral, or hormonal processes to affect an animal's capacity to reproduce, develop and grow, or deal with stress and other challenges. By adopting a definition of neuroendocrine disruption that encompasses both direct physiological targets and their indirect downstream effects, from the level of the individual to the ecosystem, a more comprehensive picture of the consequences of environmentally relevant EDC exposure may emerge.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  90     Total Times Cited:  101     Cited Reference Count:  117,10.1080/10937404.2011.578273     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PAPER-MILL EFFLUENTS;RED SWAMP CRAYFISH;GOLDFISH CARASSIUS-AURATUS;PITUITARY-TESTICULAR AXIS;PROCAMBARUS-CLARKII;UCA-PUGILATOR;FIDDLER-CRAB;ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS;GENE-EXPRESSION;WASTE-WATER,NA,NA,neuroendocrine disruption more than hormones are upset

In 1996, hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (means: 15-20 ng/g lipid), p,p'-DDE (5-13 ng/g lipid) and mirex (1-7 ng/g lipid) predominated, while PCBs were minor components (PCB 153: 0.4-2 ng/g lipid). Concentration patterns were species-dependent: PCB 180, PCB 153, mirex, nonachlor III, trans-nonachlor and the toxaphene compound B8-1413 were highest in the bottom invertebrate feeder Gobionotothen gibberifrons and lowest in the krill feeder Champsocephalus gunnari. Levels of p,p'-DDE, PCB 138 and heptachloro-1'-methyl-1,2'-bipyrrole (Q1), a natural bioaccumulative product, were highest in the fish feeder Chaenocephalus aceratus, whereas HCB was present in about equal concentrations in all species. Most compounds were taken up preferentially via the benthic food chain, the chlorinated bipyrrole via the pelagic food chain and HCB from the water. In antarctic fish, biomagnification was generally more important than bioconcentration. Between 1987 and 1996, most persistent organic pollutant (POP) levels showed significant increases in the benthos feeder and the fish feeder, while they remained nearly constant or increased less in the krill feeder. Hence, the former species represent indicator species for changing POP levels in Antarctica. Ratios (1996/1987) of average concentrations in G. gibberifrons were: PCB 138 0.7, HCB 0.8, 138-1413 1.5, PCB 180 1.7, PCB 153 1.8, p,p'-DDE 2.0, nonachlor III 2.9, trans-nonachlor 3.3, mirex 6.7. By comparison with trends in the northern hemisphere it is concluded that global distribution of HCB is close to equilibrium. Changing levels of other POPs reflect global redistribution and increasing transfer to antarctic waters probably due to recent usage in the southern hemisphere and climate changes.

The goal of the present study was to determine concentration-dependent effects of developmental exposure to NP and EE on gametogenesis, as well as gonad, kidney and liver pathology using quantitative histological evaluation of hematoxylin/eosin-stained saggital sections of zebrafish (Danio rerio). The major finding of the present study was that exposure to NP (greater than or equal to 100 mug/l nominal) and EE (greater than or equal to1 ng/l nominal) from 2 to 60 days post-hatch (dph) caused concentration-dependent suppression of gametogenesis in both male and female zebrafish. Severe kidney pathology was observed in 60 dph zebrafish, specifically glomerular dilation or degeneration, fibrosis, tubule enlargement and tubule necrosis, at a threshold of 10 ng/l EE. However, minor kidney histopathology indicated by increased pyknotic nuclei in kidney tubule and interstitial (hematopoietic) cells was detected at lower estrogenic exposures (greater than or equal to 10 mug/l NP nominal) than delayed gametogenesis. Considering all histological parameters in the current study, the rank order of potency for pathological effects in 60 dph zebrafish was 10 ng/l EE > 1 ng/l EE = 100 mug/l NP > 30 mug/l NP > 10 mug/l NP10 (nominal concentrations). Zebrafish from the same cohort examined in the current study that had been placed in clean water from 60 to 300 dph had histologically normal testes and no kidney or liver histopathology. However, increased ovarian follicle atresia was detected at 300 dph in zebrafish exposed developmentally to 100 mug/l NP. Therefore, we conclude that functional rather than morphological changes may be more important for future evaluations of developmental exposure to estrogens in fish, and that negative effects in female rather than male gonads may contribute to prolonged breeding impairment.

This paper reviews the literature regarding various sources of estrogens, in surface, source and drinking water, with an emphasis on the active molecule that comes from OCs. It includes discussion of the various agricultural, industrial, and municipal sources and outlines the contributions of estrogenic chemicals to the estrogenicity of waterways and estimates that the risk of exposure to synthetic estrogens in drinking water on human health is negligible.

The Japanese medaka HPG-PCR array combines the quantitative performance of SYBR (R) Green-based real-time PCR with the multiple gene profiling capabilities of a microarray to examine expression profiles of 36 genes associated with endocrine pathways in brain, liver and gonad. The performance of the Japanese medaka HPG-PCR array was evaluated by examining effects of two model compounds, the synthetic estrogen, 17(x-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and the anabolic androgen, 17 beta-trenbolone (TRB) on the HPG axis of the Japanese medaka. Four-month-old medaka was exposed to three concentrations of EE2 (5,50,500 ng/L) or TRB (50,500,5000 ng/L) for 7 d in a static renewal exposure system. A pathway-based approach was implemented to analyze and visualize concentration-dependent mRNA expression in the HPG axis of Japanese medaka. The compensatory response to EE2 exposure included the down-regulation of male brain GnRH RI and testicular CYP17 The down-regulation of AR-alpha expression in brain of EE2-exposed males was associated with suppression of male sexual behavior. Compensatory responses to TRB in the female HPG axis included up-regulation of brain GnRH RII and ovary steroidogenic CYP19A. Overall, the results suggested that the Japanese medaka HPG-PCR array has potential not only as a screening tool of potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals but also in elucidating mechanisms of action.

In teleosts, the pituitary receives a more or less direct innervation by neurons sending projections to the vicinity of the pituitary gonadotrophs. Among the neurotransmitters and neuropeptides released by these nerve endings are gonadotrophin-releasing hormones (GnRH) and dopamine, acting as stimulatory and inhibitory factors (in many but not all fish) on the liberation of LH and to a lesser extent that of FSH. The activity of the corresponding neurons depends on a complex interplay between external and internal factors that will ultimately influence the triggering of puberty and sexual maturation. Among these factors are sex steroids and other peripheral hormones and growth factors, but little is known regarding their targets.        However, very recently a new actor has entered the field of reproductive physiology. KiSS1, first known as a tumor suppressor called metastin, and its receptor GPR54, are now central to the regulation of GnRH, and consequently LH and FSH secretion in mammals. The KiSS system is notably viewed as instrumental in integrating both environmental cues and metabolic signals and passing this information onto the reproductive axis. In fish, there are two KiSS genes, KiSS1 and KiSS2, expressed in neurons of the preoptic area and mediobasal hypothalamus. Pionneer studies indicate that KiSS and GPR54 expression seem to be activated at puberty. Although precise information as to the physiological effects of KiSS1 in fish, notably on GnRH neurons and gonadotropin release, is still limited, KiSS neurons may emerge as the ""gatekeeper"" of puberty and reproduction in fish as in mammals.
