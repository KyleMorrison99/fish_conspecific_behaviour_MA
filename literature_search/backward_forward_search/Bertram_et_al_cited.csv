While numerous studies have monitored APIs in rivers, these employ different analytical methods, measure different APIs, and have ignored many of the countries of the world. This makes it difficult to quantify the scale of the problem from a global perspective. Furthermore, comparison of the existing data, generated for different studies/regions/continents, is challenging due to the vast differences between the analytical methodologies employed. Here, we present a global-scale study of API pollution in 258 of the world's rivers, representing the environmental influence of 471.4 million people across 137 geographic regions. Samples were obtained from 1,052 locations in 104 countries (representing all continents and 36 countries not previously studied for API contamination) and analyzed for 61 APIs. Highest cumulative API concentrations were observed in sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia, and South America. The most contaminated sites were in low- to middle-income countries and were associated with areas with poor wastewater and waste management infrastructure and pharmaceutical manufacturing. The most frequently detected APIs were carbamazepine, metformin, and caffeine (a compound also arising from lifestyle use), which were detected at over half of the sites monitored. Concentrations of at least one API at 25.7% of the sampling sites were greater than concentrations considered safe for aquatic organisms, or which are of concern in terms of selection for antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, pharmaceutical pollution poses a global threat to environmental and human health, as well as to delivery of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.","[Wilkinson, John L.; Boxall, Alistair B.

Recent technological advances in data collection and management have transformed our understanding of animal movement ecology (the integrated study of organismal movement), creating a big-data discipline that benefits from rapid, cost-effective generation of large amounts of data on movements of animals in the wild. These high-throughput wildlife tracking systems now allow more thorough investigation of variation among individuals and species across space and time, the nature of biological interactions, and behavioral responses to the environment. Movement ecology is rapidly expanding scientific frontiers through large interdisciplinary and collaborative frameworks, providing improved opportunities for conservation and insights into the movements of wild animals, and their causes and consequences.","[Nathan, Ran;

We develop an innovative experimental approach, integrating biologically inspired robotics, time-series analysis, and computer vision, to build a detailed profile of the effects of non-lethal stress on the ecology and evolution of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki)-a global pest. We reveal that brief exposures to a robotic predator alter mosquitofish behavior, increasing fear and stress responses, and mitigate the impact of mosquitofish on native tadpoles (Litoria moorei) in a cause-and-effect fashion. Effects of predation risk from the robot carry over to routine activity and feeding rate of mosquitofish weeks after exposure, resulting in weight loss, variation in body shape, and reduction in the fertility of both sexes-impairing survival, reproduction, and ecological success. We capitalize on evolved responses of mosquitofish to reduce predation risk-neglected in biological control practices-and provide scientific foundations for widespread use of state-of-the-art robotics in ecology and evolution research.","[Polverino, Giovanni; Soman, Vrishin R.; Gasparini, Clelia; Evans, Jonathan P.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Soman, Vrishin R.; Karakaya, Mert; Porfiri, Maurizio] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Gasparini, Clelia] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Padua, Italy; [Porfiri, Maurizio] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Porfiri, Maurizio] NYU, Ctr Urban Sci & Progress, Tandon Sch Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA",University of Western Australia; New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering; University of Padua; New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering; New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering,"Polverino, G (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",gio.polverino@gmail.com,"Gasparini, Clelia/F-2159-2011; Evans, Jonathan/A-1992-2011; Polverino, Giovanni/AAC-2556-2020; Porfiri, Maurizio/A-1712-2009; Karakaya, Mert/GOK-2781-2022","Evans, Jonathan/0000-0002-2603-6832; Polverino, Giovanni/0000-0001-9737-7995; Karakaya, Mert/0000-0002-8158-3337; Gasparini, Clelia/0000-0001-9172-1142","Forrest Research Foundation fellowship; University of Western Australia [12104502, 68000003]; National Science Foundation [CMMI-1505832, CMMI-1901697]; Australian Research Council DECRA fellowship [DE150101625]; Australian Research Council [DE150101625] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Forrest Research Foundation fellowship; University of Western Australia; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Australian Research Council DECRA fellowship(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank Sachit Butail and Russell Bonduriansky for their feedback on the study design.

Consistent inter-individual variation in 'sociability' is considered one of the major axes of personality variation in animals along with aggressiveness, activity, exploration and boldness. Not only is variation in sociability important in terms of animal personalities, but it holds particular significance for, and can be informed by, two other topics of major interest: social networks and collective behaviour. Further, knowledge of what generates inter-individual variation in social behaviour also holds applied implications, such as understanding disorders of social behaviour in humans. In turn, research using non-human animals in the genetics, neuroscience and physiology of these disorders can inform our understanding of sociability. For the first time, this review brings together insights across these areas of research, across animal taxa from primates to invertebrates, and across studies from both the laboratory and field. We show there are mixed results in whether and how sociability correlates with other major behavioural traits. Whether and in what direction these correlations are observed may differ with individual traits such as sex and body condition, as well as ecological conditions. A large body of evidence provides the proximate mechanisms for why individuals vary in their social tendency. Evidence exists for the importance of genes and their expression, chemical messengers, social interactions and the environment in determining an individual's social tendency, although the specifics vary with species and other variables such as age, and interactions amongst these proximate factors. Less well understood is how evolution can maintain consistent variation in social tendencies within populations. Shifts in the benefits and costs of social tendencies over time, as well as the social niche hypothesis, are currently the best supported theories for how variation in sociability can evolve and be maintained in populations. Increased exposure to infectious diseases is the best documented cost of a greater social tendency, and benefits include greater access to socially transmitted information. We also highlight that direct evidence for more sociable individuals being safer from predators is lacking. Variation in sociability is likely to have broad ecological consequences, but beyond its importance in the spread of infectious diseases, direct evidence is limited to a few examples related to dispersal and invasive species biology. Overall, our knowledge of inter-individual variation in sociability is highly skewed towards the proximate mechanisms. Our review also demonstrates, however, that considering research from social networks and collective behaviour greatly enriches our understanding of sociability, highlighting the need for greater integration of these approaches into future animal personality research to address the imbalance in our understanding of sociability as a personality trait.","[Gartland, Lizzy A.; Ioannou, Christos C.] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England; [Firth, Josh A.] Univ Oxford, Edward Grey Inst, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3SZ, England; [Laskowski, Kate L.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Jeanson, Raphael] Univ Toulouse, Ctr Rech Cognit Anim UMR5169, Ctr Biol Integrat, UPS,CNRS, F-31062 Toulouse, France",University of Bristol; University of Oxford; University of California System; University of California Davis; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Ioannou, CC (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England.",c.c.ioannou@bristol.ac.uk,,"Firth, Josh/0000-0001-7183-4115; Laskowski, Kate L./0000-0003-1523-9340; Ioannou, Christos/0000-0002-9739-889X","Natural Environment Research Council [NE/P012639/1]; BBSRC [BB/S009752/1]; NERC [NE/S010335/1]; BBSRC [BB/S009752/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/S010335/1, NE/P012639/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),We thank Daniel Blumstein and Melanie Dammhahn for constructive comments which improved the manuscript.

Targeted analytical measurement data directly sup-port risk assessment activities, as well as downstream risk management and compliance monitoring efforts. Yet, targeted methods have struggled to keep pace with the demands for data regarding the vast, and growing, number of known chemicals. Many contemporary monitoring studies therefore utilize non-targeted analysis (NTA) methods to screen for known chemicals with limited risk information. Qualitative NTA data has enabled identification of previously unknown compounds and characterization of data-poor compounds in support of hazard identification and exposure assessment efforts. In spite of this, NTA data have seen limited use in risk -based decision making due to uncertainties surrounding their quantitative interpretation. Significant efforts have been made in recent years to bridge this quantitative gap. Based on these advancements, quantitative NTA data, when coupled with other high-throughput data streams and predictive models, are poised to directly support 21st-century risk-based decisions. This article highlights components of the chemical risk assessment process that are influenced by NTA data, surveys the existing literature for approaches to derive quantitative estimates of chemicals from NTA measurements, and presents a conceptual framework for incorporating NTA data into contemporary risk assessment frameworks.","[McCord, James P.] US EPA, Ctr Environm Measurement & Modeling, Off Res & Dev, 109 TW Alexander Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA; [Groff, Louis C., II; Sobus, Jon R.] US EPA, Ctr Computat Toxicol & Exposure, Off Res & Dev, 109 TW Alexander Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA; [Groff, Louis C., II] Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ ORISE, 109 TW Alexander Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Oak Ridge Associated Universities; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge Institute for Science & Education,"McCord, JP (corresponding author), US EPA, Ctr Environm Measurement & Modeling, Off Res & Dev, 109 TW Alexander Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA.",mccord.james@epa.gov,"McCord, James/IUN-5967-2023","McCord, James/0000-0002-1780-4916; Sobus, Jon/0000-0003-0740-6604; Groff, Louis/0000-0002-6357-0508",,,,,141,31,35,5,61,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0160-4120,1873-6750,,ENVIRON INT,Environ.

When a population experiences the same conditions, we might expect all individuals to adjust their trait expression to the same, optimal, value, thereby minimising phenotypic variation. Instead, variation abounds. Individuals substantially differ not only from each other, but also from their former selves, with the expression of labile traits varying both predictably and unpredictably over time. A powerful tool for studying the evolution of phenotypic variation in labile traits is the mixed model. Here, we review how mixed models are used to quantify individual differences in both means and variability, and their between-individual correlations. Individuals can differ in their average phenotypes (e.g. behavioural personalities), their variability (known as 'predictability' or intra-individual variability), and their plastic response to different contexts. We provide detailed descriptions and resources for simultaneously modelling individual differences in averages, plasticity and predictability. Empiricists can use these methods to quantify how traits covary across individuals and test theoretical ideas about phenotypic integration. These methods can be extended to incorporate plastic changes in predictability (termed 'stochastic malleability'). Overall, we showcase the unfulfilled potential of existing statistical tools to test more holistic and nuanced questions about the evolution, function, and maintenance of phenotypic variation, for any trait that is repeatedly expressed.","[O'Dea, Rose E.; Nakagawa, Shinichi] Univ New South Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [O'Dea, Rose E.; Nakagawa, Shinichi] Garvan Inst Med Res, Diabet & Metab Div, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Noble, Daniel W.

Nonetheless, individual variation in fine-scale movement behaviours is rarely examined even though animal tracking devices offer the long-term, high-resolution, repeatable data in natural conditions that are ideal for studying this variation. Furthermore, of the few studies that consider individual variation in movement, even fewer also consider the internal traits and environmental factors that drive movement behaviour which are necessary for contextualising individual differences in movement patterns. In this study, we GPS tracked a free-ranging population of sleepy lizards Tiliqua rugosa, each Austral spring over 5 years to examine consistent among-individual variation in movement patterns, as well as how these differences were mediated by key internal and ecological factors. We found that individuals consistently differed in a suite of weekly movement traits, and that these traits strongly covaried among-individuals, forming movement syndromes. Lizards fell on a primary movement continuum, from 'residents' that spent extended periods of time residing within smaller core areas of their home range, to 'explorers' that moved greater distances and explored vaster areas of the environment. Importantly, we also found that these consistent differences in lizard movement were related to two ecologically important animal personality traits (boldness and aggression), their sex, key features of the environment (including food availability, and a key water resource), habitat type and seasonal variation (cool/moist vs. hot/drier) in environmental conditions. Broadly, these movement specialisations likely reflect variation in life-history tactics including foraging and mating tactics that ultimately underlie key differences in space use. Such information can be used to connect phenotypic population structure to key ecological and evolutionary processes, for example social networks and disease-transmission pathways, further highlighting the value of examining individual variation in movement behaviour.","[Michelangeli, Marcus; Payne, Eric; Spiegel, Orr; Sinn, David L.; Sih, Andrew] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Michelangeli, Marcus] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Michelangeli, Marcus] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, Umea, Sweden; [Spiegel, Orr] Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Leu, Stephan T.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Anim & Vet Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Gardner, Michael G.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Gardner, Michael G.] South Australian Museum, Evolutionary Biol Unit, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of California System; University of California Davis; Monash University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Tel Aviv University; University of Adelaide; Flinders University South Australia; South Australian Museum,"Michelangeli, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",marcus.michelangeli@slu.se,"Michelangeli, Marcus/AAN-2412-2020; Spiegel, Orr/D-4035-2011; Gardner, Michael G/A-8280-2011; Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Michelangeli, Marcus/0000-0002-0053-6759; Spiegel, Orr/0000-0001-8941-3175; Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663; Leu, Stephan T./0000-0003-2547-5056; Payne, Eric/0000-0002-0730-0837","Australian Research Council [DP0877384, DP130100145]; National Science Foundation [DEB-1456730]; Australian Research Council [DP0877384] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP0877384 and DP130100145; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1456730",,82,10,11,5,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The social environment, however, represents the arena in which individual-level performance shapes group- or population-level outcomes and may therefore mediate many of the ultimate consequences of chemicals for wildlife. Here, we evaluated the role that the social environment plays in determining the consequences of pollutant exposure. We exposed groups of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) to an emerging pharmaceutical pollutant that is commonly detected in freshwaters (the benzodiazepine, oxazepam) and allowed them to form dominance hierarchies. Exposure affected dominant and subordinate fish differently, causing fish to become less aggressive at high doses and subordinate fish to become more competitively successful at low doses. These perturbations had further consequences for growth, fin damage, and survival. Exposure also modulated physiological stress in the hierarchy, and social status itself affected how much oxazepam was absorbed in tissues, potentially creating a dynamic feedback loop that further influences the asymmetric effects of exposure on differing social statuses. Many effects followed a U-shaped dose-response curve, highlighting the importance of nonlinear, low-dose effects. Altogether, we show that social structure in animal groups can interact with and modulate the effects of an environmental contaminant. We underscore the need to account for an organism's natural ecological context, including their social environment, in future experiments and environmental risk assessments to predict the effects of chemical contaminants on wildlife.","[Mccallum, Erin S.; Cerveny, Daniel; Brodin, Tomas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, Umea, Sweden; [Dey, Cody J.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Great Lakes Lab Fisheries & Aquat Sci, 867 Lakeshore Rd, Burlington, ON L7S 1A1, Canada; [Cerveny, Daniel] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Fisheries & Protect Waters, South Bohemian Res Ctr Aquaculture & Biodivers Hy, Zatisi 728-2, Vodnany, Czech Republic; [Bose, Aneesh P.

Typically, behavioral effects of these contaminants are assessed using animals tested in social isolation. However, for group-living species, effects seen in isolation may not reflect those occurring in realistic social settings. Furthermore, interactions between chemical pollution and other stressors, such as predation risk, are seldom considered. This is true even though animals in the wild are rarely, if ever, confronted by chemical pollution as a single stressor. Here, in a 2 year multigenerational experiment, we tested for effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine (measured concentrations [+/- SD]: 42.27 +/- 36.14 and 359.06 +/- 262.65 ng/L) on shoaling behavior in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) across different social contexts and under varying levels of perceived predation risk. Shoaling propensity and shoal choice (choice of groups with different densities) were assessed in a Y-maze under the presence of a predatory or nonpredatory heterospecific, with guppies tested individually and in male-female pairs. When tested individually, no effect of fluoxetine was seen on shoaling behavior. However, in paired trials, high-fluoxetine-exposed fish exhibited a significantly greater shoaling propensity. Hence, effects of fluoxetine were mediated by social context, highlighting the importance of this fundamental but rarely considered factor when evaluating impacts of environmental pollution.","[Mason, Rachel T.; Martin, Jake M.; Tan, Hung; Brand, Jack A.; Tingley, Reid; Todd-Weckmann, Andrew; Wong, Bob B.

Well-quantified laboratory studies can provide a fundamental understanding of animal behavior in ecology, ethology and ecotoxicology research. These types of studies require observation and tracking of each animal in well-controlled and defined arenas, often for long timescales. Thus, these experiments produce long time series and a vast amount of data that require the use of software applications to automate the analysis and reduce manual annotation. In this review, we examine 28 free software applications for animal tracking to guide researchers in selecting the software that might best suit a particular experiment. We also review the algorithms in the tracking pipeline of the applications, explain how specific techniques can fit different experiments, and finally, expose each approach's weaknesses and strengths. Our in-depth review includes last update, type of platform, user-friendliness, off- or online video acquisition, calibration method, background subtraction and segmentation method, species, multiple arenas, multiple animals, identity preservation, manual identity correction, data analysis and extra features. We found, for example, that out of 28 programs, only 3 include a calibration algorithm to reduce image distortion and perspective problems that affect accuracy and can result in substantial errors when analyzing trajectories and extracting mobility or explored distance. In addition, only 4 programs can directly export in-depth tracking and analysis metrics, only 5 are suited for tracking multiple unmarked animals for more than a few seconds and only 11 have been updated in the period 2019-2021.","[Panadeiro, Veronica; Rodriguez, Alvaro] Univ A Coruna, Dept Comp Sci, Campus Elvina, La Coruna, Spain; [Rodriguez, Alvaro] Univ A Coruna, Ctr Res Informat & Commun Technol CITIC, Campus Elvina, La Coruna, Spain; [Rodriguez, Alvaro] UNED, Dept Basic Psychol 1, Ciudad Univ, Madrid, Spain; [Henry, Jason; Wlodkowic, Donald] RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Neurotox Lab, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Andersson, Magnus] Umea Univ, Dept Phys, Umea, Sweden",Universidade da Coruna; Universidade da Coruna; Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Umea University,"Rodriguez, A (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, Dept Comp Sci, Campus Elvina, La Coruna, Spain.;Rodriguez, A (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, Ctr Res Informat & Commun Technol CITIC, Campus Elvina, La Coruna, Spain.;Rodriguez, A (corresponding author), UNED, Dept Basic Psychol 1, Ciudad Univ, Madrid, Spain.",a.tajes@udc.es,"Andersson, Magnus/A-3591-2009; Rodriguez, Alvaro/M-9208-2014","Andersson, Magnus/0000-0002-9835-3263; Rodriguez, Alvaro/0000-0002-2690-090X; Wlodkowic, Donald/0000-0002-0780-3362; Panadeiro Castro, Veronica/0000-0002-8085-537X; Henry, Jason/0000-0002-0059-3868",,,,,79,39,42,9,60,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",0093-7355,1548-4475,,LAB ANIMAL,Lab Anim.,2021 SEP,2021,50,9,,,,,246,254,,10.1038/s41684-021-00811-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41684-021-00811-1,,JUL 2021,9,Veterinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Veterinary Sciences,UE6NP,34326537,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000679222800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A variety of ecological and evolutionary processes are dependent on social interactions, such as movement, disease spread, information transmission, and density-dependent reproduction and survival. Social interactions, like any behaviour, are context dependent, varying with environmental conditions. Currently, environments are changing rapidly across multiple dimensions, becoming warmer and more variable, while habitats are increasingly fragmented and contaminated with pollutants. Social interactions are expected to change in response to these stressors and to continue to change into the future. However, a comprehensive understanding of the form and magnitude of the effects of these environmental changes on social interactions is currently lacking. Focusing on four major forms of rapid environmental change currently occurring, we review how these changing environmental gradients are expected to have immediate effects on social interactions such as communication, agonistic behaviours, and group formation, which will thereby induce changes in social organisation including mating systems, dominance hierarchies, and collective behaviour. Our review covers intraspecific variation in social interactions across environments, including studies in both the wild and in laboratory settings, and across a range of taxa. The expected responses of social behaviour to environmental change are diverse, but we identify several general themes. First, very dry, variable, fragmented, or polluted environments are likely to destabilise existing social systems. This occurs as these conditions limit the energy available for complex social interactions and affect dissimilar phenotypes differently. Second, a given environmental change can lead to opposite responses in social behaviour, and the direction of the response often hinges on the natural history of the organism in question. Third, our review highlights the fact that changes in environmental factors are not occurring in isolation: multiple factors are changing simultaneously, which may have antagonistic or synergistic effects, and more work should be done to understand these combined effects. We close by identifying methodological and analytical techniques that might help to study the response of social interactions to changing environments, highlight consistent patterns among taxa, and predict subsequent evolutionary change. We expect that the changes in social interactions that we document here will have consequences for individuals, groups, and for the ecology and evolution of populations, and therefore warrant a central place in the study of animal populations, particularly in an era of rapid environmental change.","[Fisher, David N.] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Kings Coll, Aberdeen AB24 3FX, Scotland; [Kilgour, R.

Altered movement behavior and preference for methamphetamine during withdrawal were linked to drug residues in fish brain tissues and accompanied by brain metabolome changes.

Low-cost single-board computers are predicted to be one of the key technological advancements to further revolutionise this field. So far, an overview of current uptake of these devices and a general guide to help researchers integrate them in their work has been missing. In this paper I focus on the most widely used single-board computer, the Raspberry Pi, and review its broad applications and uses across the biological domain. Since its release in 2012, the Raspberry Pi has been increasingly taken up by biologists, in the laboratory, the field and in the classroom, and across a wide range of disciplines. A hugely diverse range of applications exists that ranges from simple solutions to dedicated custom-build devices, including nest-box monitoring, wildlife camera trapping, high-throughput behavioural recording, large-scale plant phenotyping, underwater video surveillance, closed-loop operant learning experiments and autonomous ecosystem monitoring. Despite the breadth of its implementations, the depth of uptake of the Raspberry Pi by the scientific community is still limited. The broad capabilities of the Raspberry Pi, combined with its low cost, ease of use and large user community make it a great research tool for almost any project. To help accelerate the uptake of the Raspberry Pi by the scientific community, I provide detailed guidelines, recommendations and considerations, and 30+ step-by-step guides on a dedicated accompanying website (). I hope this paper will help generate more awareness about the Raspberry Pi among scientists and thereby both fuel the democratisation of science and ultimately help advance our understanding of biology, from the micro- to the macro-scale.","[Jolles, Jolle W.] Univ Konstanz, Zukunftskolleg, Constance, Germany; [Jolles, Jolle W.] Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Collect Behav, Constance, Germany; [Jolles, Jolle W.] Ctr Res Ecol & Forestry Applicat CREAF, Barcelona, Spain",University of Konstanz; Max Planck Society; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF-CERCA),"Jolles, JW (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Zukunftskolleg, Constance, Germany.;Jolles, JW (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Collect Behav, Constance, Germany.;Jolles, JW (corresponding author), Ctr Res Ecol & Forestry Applicat CREAF, Barcelona, Spain.",j.w.jolles@gmail.com,"Jolles, Jolle Wolter/E-9842-2011","Jolles, Jolle Wolter/0000-0001-9905-2633","Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung; Dobberke Foundation; Zukunftskolleg, Institute of Advanced study","Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Dobberke Foundation; Zukunftskolleg, Institute of Advanced study","Zukunftskolleg, Institute of Advanced study; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung; Dobberke Foundation",,123,65,68,3,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

These chemicals can be continually released, persist, or even accumulate over time, with adverse effects on the physiology and behavior of aquatic species. Most studies aimed at evaluating the intergenerational effects of CECs have focused exclusively on single chemicals. By comparison, little is known about the effects of complex CEC mixtures on the behavior of organisms, or how these effects might manifest in subsequent generations. In this study, we exposed three generations of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to environmentally relevant concentrations of a complex CEC mixture representative of urban-impacted waterways and assessed the growth and behavior of larval and adult fish in life-stage-relevant fitness contexts (foraging, boldness, courtship). We found that (i) multigenerational exposure to a complex mixture of CECs altered the behavior of both larvae and adults in different fitness contexts; (ii) concentration-dependent patterns of behavioral impairment were consistent across fitness contexts and life stages; and (iii) the effects of exposure were magnified in the F1 and F2 generations. These results highlight the need for long-term, multigenerational assessments of CECs in affected waterways to robustly inform conservation practices aimed at managing aquatic systems.

Neurochemicals are shown to alter the behaviour of common study species but it remains difficult to translate these results to biologically meaningful predictions across taxa. This is partly because studies on species with non-generic life-history strategies such as many freshwater crustaceans are currently underrepresented. Here, we use a laboratory experiment to assess baseline behavioural variation (spontaneous activity level and geotaxic behaviour) in the freshwater fairy shrimp Branchipodopsis wolfi and how this is affected by chronic exposure to an environmentally-relevant concentration of the anxiolytic pharmaceutical fluoxetine. The more conspicuously coloured and larger females of the species were overall less active and more benthic than males. Moreover, amongst females, vertical activity was negatively associated with size, while an opposite relationship was found for males. These trade-offs are likely part of an antipredator strategy to reduce the probability of being detected by visual hunters, but disappeared after exposure to fluoxetine. This is of particular interest since it is an effective proof of principle that neurochemicals may impact ecologically-relevant trade-offs between conspicuous morphology and antipredator behaviour. In natural ecosystems, such disturbed antipredator behavioural responses could have far-reaching fitness consequences.","[Thore, Eli S.

Despite this, few data have been generated on pharmacological mechanisms of action other than GABA(A) antagonism. Assessing larval responsiveness across multiple mechanisms is vital to test the translational power of this approach, as well as assessing its validity for detecting unwanted drug-induced seizures and testing antiepileptic drug efficacy. Experimental Approach Using light-sheet imaging, we systematically analysed the responsiveness of 4 days post fertilisation (dpf; which are not considered protected under European animal experiment legislation) transgenic larval zebrafish to treatment with 57 compounds spanning more than 12 drug classes with a link to seizure generation in mammals, alongside eight compounds with no such link. Key Results We show 4dpf zebrafish are responsive to a wide range of mechanisms implicated in seizure generation, with cerebellar circuitry activated regardless of the initiating pharmacology. Analysis of functional connectivity revealed compounds targeting cholinergic and monoaminergic reuptake, in particular, showed phenotypic consistency broadly mapping onto what is known about neurotransmitter-specific circuitry in the larval zebrafish brain. Many seizure-associated compounds also exhibited altered whole brain functional connectivity compared with controls. Conclusions and Implications This work represents a significant step forward in understanding the translational power of 4dpf larval zebrafish for use in neuropharmacological studies and for studying the events driving transition from small-scale pharmacological activation of local circuits, to the large network-wide abnormal synchronous activity associated with seizures.","[Winter, Matthew J.; Pinion, Joseph; Tochwin, Anna; Takesono, Aya; Ball, Jonathan S.; Metz, Jeremy; Trznadel, Maciej; Hetheridge, Malcolm J.; Tyler, Charles R.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Biosci, 223 Geoffrey Pope Bldg,Stocker Rd, Exeter EX4 4QD, Devon, England; [Goodfellow, Marc] Univ Exeter, Dept Math, Exeter, Devon, England; [Goodfellow, Marc] Univ Exeter, Living Syst Inst, Exeter, Devon, England; [Goodfellow, Marc] Univ Exeter, EPSRC Ctr Predict Modelling Healthcare, Exeter, Devon, England; [Grabowski, Piotr] AstraZeneca R&D, Clin Pharmacol & Safety Sci, Data Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Cambridge, England; [Tse, Karen; Redfern, Will S.] AstraZeneca R&D, Clin Pharmacol & Safety Sci, Safety & Mech Pharmacol, Cambridge, England; [Tse, Karen] GW Pharmaceut Plc, Sovereign House, Cambridge, England; [Redfern, Will S.] Certara UK Ltd, Simcyp Div, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Randall, Andrew D.] Univ Exeter, Med Sch, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter; University of Exeter; University of Exeter; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); AstraZeneca; AstraZeneca; Certara UK Ltd; University of Exeter,"Winter, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Biosci, 223 Geoffrey Pope Bldg,Stocker Rd, Exeter EX4 4QD, Devon, England.",m.winter@exeter.ac.uk,,"Goodfellow, Marc/0000-0002-7282-7280; Ball, Jonathan/0000-0002-3046-3829","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/L020637/1, BB/P025528/1]; National Centre for the Replacement Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research [NC/R001421/1]; University of Exeter, College of Life and Environmental Sciences; Medical Research Council; European Union; AstraZeneca; BBSRC [BB/L020637/1, BB/P025528/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); National Centre for the Replacement Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement & Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs)); University of Exeter, College of Life and Environmental Sciences; Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); European Union(European Union (EU)); AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC))","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Grant/Award Numbers: BB/L020637/1, BB/P025528/1; National Centre for the Replacement Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research, Grant/Award Number: NC/R001421/1; University of Exeter, College of Life and Environmental Sciences; Medical Research Council; AstraZeneca; European Union",,68,14,14,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0007-1188,1476-5381,,BRIT J PHARMACOL,Br.

We tested how three types of exposure duration to 4 degrees C warming (acute, developmental and transgenerational exposure to 24 degrees C vs 20 degrees C) shape the effect of the pesticide chlorpyrifos on two ecologically relevant fitness-related traits of mosquito larvae: heat tolerance and antipredator behaviour. Transgenerational (from the parental generation) and developmental (from the egg stage) warming appeared energetically more stressful than acute warming (from the final instar), because (i) only the latter resulted in an adaptive increase of heat tolerance, and (ii) especially developmental and transgenerational warming reduced the diving responsiveness and diving time. Exposure to chlorpyrifos decreased the heat tolerance, diving responsiveness and diving time. The impact of chlorpyrifos was lower at 24 degrees C than at 20 degrees C indicating that the expected increase in toxicity at 24 degrees C was overruled by the observed increase in pesticide degradation. Notably, although our results suggest that transgenerational warming was energetically more stressful, it did reduce the chlorpyrifos-induced negative effects at 24 degrees C on heat tolerance and the alarm escape response compared to acute warming. Our results provide important evidence that the exposure duration to warming may determine the impact of a pesticide under warming, thereby identifying a novel temporal aspect of stressor interactions in risk assessment.

Although two-dimensional approaches can track visible landmarks in restrictive environments, performance drops in freely moving animals, due to occlusions and appearance changes. Therefore, we designed DANNCE to robustly track anatomical landmarks in 3D across species and behaviors. DANNCE uses projective geometry to construct inputs to a convolutional neural network that leverages learned 3D geometric reasoning.

Moreover, due to recent technological and computational advances, scientists are now increasingly aware that a wide variety of contaminants and other environmental stressors adversely affect organismal behavior and subsequent ecological outcomes in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. There is also a groundswell of concern that regulatory ecotoxicology does not adequately consider behavior, primarily due to a lack of standardized toxicity methods. This has, in turn, led to the exclusion of many behavioral ecotoxicology studies from chemical risk assessments. To improve understanding of the challenges and opportunities for behavioral ecotoxicology within regulatory toxicology/risk assessment, a unique workshop with international representatives from the fields of behavioral ecology, ecotoxicology, regulatory (eco)toxicology, neurotoxicology, test standardization, and risk assessment resulted in the formation of consensus perspectives and recommendations, which promise to serve as a roadmap to advance interfaces among the basic and translational sciences, and regulatory practices.","[Agerstrand, Marlene] Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Brooks, Bryan W.] Baylor Univ, Inst Biomed Studies, Dept Environm Sci, Waco, TX 76706 USA; [Brooks, Bryan W.] Jinan Univ, Sch Environm, Guangdong Key Lab Environm Pollut & Hlth, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Allen, Joel; Lazorchak, James M.] US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA; [Bertram, Michael G.; Brodin, Tomas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Umea, Sweden; [Dang, ZhiChao; Smit, Els] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm RIVM, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Duquesne, Sabine; Sahm, Rene; Jacob, Stefanie; Mohr, Silvia; Maack, Gerd] German Environm Agcy UBA, Dessau, Germany; [Hoffmann, Frauke] German Fed Inst Risk Assessment, Dept Chem & Prod Safety, Berlin, Germany; [Hollert, Henner] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Kluever, Nils] Environm Res Ctr UFZ, Leipzig, Germany; [Ledesma, Mariana; Scholz, Stefan] Swedish Chem Agcy KemI, Sundbyberg, Stockholms Lan, Sweden; [Melvin, Steven D.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Southport, Qld, Australia; [Padilla, Stephanie] US EPA, Ctr Computat Toxicol & Exposure, Durham, NC USA; [Pyle, Gregory G.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Biol Sci, Lethbridge, AB, Canada; [Saaristo, Minna] Environm Protect Author Victoria EPA, Carlton, Vic, Australia; [Steevens, Jeffery A.] US Geol Survey, Columbia Environm Res Ctr, Columbia, MO 65201 USA; [van den Berg, Sanne] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kloas, Werner] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Berlin, Germany; [Wong, Bob B.

Such animals also frequently coil, resulting in complicated shapes whose ambiguity presents difficulties for standard pose estimation methods. Efficiently solving coiled shapes in C. elegans, exhibited in a variety of important natural contexts, is the primary limiting factor for fully automated high-throughput behavior analysis. WormPose provides pose estimation that works across imaging conditions, naturally complements existing worm trackers, and harnesses the power of deep convolutional networks but with an image generator to automatically provide precise image-centerline pairings for training. We apply WormPose to on-food recordings, finding a near absence of deep delta-turns. We also show that incoherent body motions in the dwell state, which do not translate the worm, have been misidentified as an increase in reversal rate by previous, centroid-based methods. We expect that the combination of a body model and image synthesis demonstrated in WormPose will be both of general interest and important for future progress in precise pose estimation in other slender-bodied and deformable organisms. An important model system for understanding genes, neurons and behavior, the nematode worm C. elegans naturally moves through a variety of complex postures, for which estimation from video data is challenging. We introduce an open-source Python package, WormPose, for 2D pose estimation in C. elegans, including self-occluded, coiled shapes. We leverage advances in machine vision afforded from convolutional neural networks and introduce a synthetic yet realistic generative model for images of worm posture, thus avoiding the need for human-labeled training. WormPose is effective and adaptable for imaging conditions across worm tracking efforts. We quantify pose estimation using synthetic data as well as N2 and mutant worms in on-food conditions. We further demonstrate WormPose by analyzing long (similar to 8 hour), fast-sampled (similar to 30 Hz) recordings of on-food N2 worms to provide a posture-scale analysis of roaming/dwelling behaviors.","[Hebert, Laetitia; Ahamed, Tosif; Stephens, Greg J.] OIST Grad Univ, Biol Phys Theory Unit, Onna, Japan; [Ahamed, Tosif] Univ Toronto, Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Costa, Antonio C.; O'Shaughnessy, Liam; Stephens, Greg J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Phys & Astron, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University; University of Toronto; Sinai Health System Toronto; Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Stephens, GJ (corresponding author), OIST Grad Univ, Biol Phys Theory Unit, Onna, Japan.;Stephens, GJ (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Phys & Astron, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",g.j.stephens@vu.nl,"ripert, marion/HHN-5115-2022; Ahamed, Tosif/JDV-6685-2023","Ahamed, Tosif/0000-0002-1405-3539; Stephens, Greg/0000-0003-3135-3514; Costa, Antonio Carlos/0000-0002-7491-9250; O'Shaughnessy, Liam/0000-0002-2260-2569",Scientific Computing section of Research Support Division at OIST,Scientific Computing section of Research Support Division at OIST,"We thank Mathijs Rozemuller (AMOLF) for code testing and for providing a tutorial dataset, as well as Jarlath Rodgers (University of Toronto) and Kelimar Diaz Cruz (Georgia Tech) for code testing.

However, such frequent interactions also have the potential to mask or suppress behavioural differences if individuals conform towards a group behavioural norm (i.e. the social conformity hypothesis) by either synchronizing their behaviour or shifting their behaviour towards that of influential group members. Both of these predictions hinge on the notion that social feedback among group members plays a key role in modulating consistent behavioural variation; thus, in the absence of such feedback, it could be expected that such consistent variation will be reduced. Here, we investigated how a 1-month housing with a stable social group, as opposed to being socially isolated, affected consistent individual differences in the shoaling tendencies of threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aceluteus. Specifically, we repeatedly tested the tendency of individual sticklebacks to shoal with conspecifics before and after their social experience. In support of the social conformity hypothesis, we observed a four-fold increase in among-group differences, but no change in among-individual differences, in the shoaling tendencies of sticklebacks housed in groups. A post hoc analysis revealed that the increase in among-group differences may have been driven by the most ?social? pretreatment group member. Conversely, fish that were housed in isolation, expressed a notable, albeit nonsignificant, decrease in individual shoaling variation and repeatability. This decrease in shoaling variation corresponded with an increase in the average shoaling tendencies of solitary fish post-treatment, suggesting that solitary fish converged towards a similarly high level of shoaling tendencies post-treatment. For both treatment groups, however, we found amongindividual positive correlations in pre- and post-treatment shoaling tendencies, suggesting that individuals may inherently differ in their shoaling tendencies, but that the social environment plays an important role in mediating the expression of these differences. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Although a whole range of studies have documented pollutant-induced changes in behaviour, natural daily variability in behaviour is rarely taken into account. This is surprising because biological rhythms may affect the outcome of experiments, are adaptive and are expected to be sensitive to neurochemical exposure. Here, we exploit daily behavioural variation in the fish model Nothobranchius furzeri to examine if behavioural effects of chronic exposure (74 days) to an environmentally relevant level (28 ng/L) of the neurochemical fluoxetine depend on the time of day. Fluoxetine exposure induced an increase in anxiety-related behaviour that was slightly more pronounced in the evening compared to the morning. Moreover, open-field locomotor activity was disrupted and daily patterns in activity lifted upon exposure to the compound. These results imply that short-term behavioural variability should be considered both to standardise ecological risk assessment of neuroactive chemicals as well as to better understand the environmental impact of such compounds in aquatic ecosystems.

Honey bees (Apis mellifera) generally change tasks as they age, but developmental trajectories of individuals can vary drastically due to physiological and environmental factors. We introduce a succinct descriptor of an individual's social network that can be obtained without interfering with the colony. This 'network age' accurately predicts task allocation, survival, activity patterns, and future behavior. We analyze developmental trajectories of multiple cohorts of individuals in a natural setting and identify distinct developmental pathways and critical life changes. Our findings suggest a high stability in task allocation on an individual level. We show that our method is versatile and can extract different properties from social networks, opening up a broad range of future studies. Our approach highlights the relationship of social interactions and individual traits, and provides a scalable technique for understanding how complex social systems function. Honey bee workers take on different tasks for the colony as they age. Here, the authors develop a method to extract a descriptor of the individuals' social networks and show that interaction patterns predict task allocation and distinguish different developmental trajectories.","[Wild, Benjamin; Dormagen, David M.; Traynor, Kirsten S.; Landgraf, Tim] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Zachariae, Adrian; Brockmann, Dirk] Robert Koch Inst, Berlin, Germany; [Smith, Michael L.; Couzin, Iain D.] Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Collect Behav, Constance, Germany; [Smith, Michael L.; Couzin, Iain D.] Univ Konstanz, Ctr Adv Study Collect Behav, Constance, Germany; [Smith, Michael L.; Couzin, Iain D.] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Constance, Germany; [Traynor, Kirsten S.] Arizona State Univ, Global Biosocial Complex Initiat, Tempe, FL USA; [Brockmann, Dirk] Humboldt Univ, Inst Theoret Biol, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Robert Koch Institute; Max Planck Society; University of Konstanz; University of Konstanz; Arizona State University; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Wild, B; Landgraf, T (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Berlin, Germany.",b.w@fu-berlin.de; tim.landgraf@fu-berlin.de,"Couzin, Iain D./Q-6862-2018; Traynor, Kirsten/GWC-1553-2022","Couzin, Iain D./0000-0001-8556-4558; Dormagen, David/0000-0002-1596-668X; Wild, Benjamin/0000-0002-7492-8448; Traynor, Kirsten/0000-0002-0848-4607; Landgraf, Tim/0000-0003-4951-5235; Smith, Michael/0000-0002-3454-962X","Andrea von Braun Foundation; Elsa-Neumann-Scholarship; Heidelberg Academy of Science; Zukunftskolleg Mentorship Program; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [824069]; Klaus Tschira Foundation [00.300.2016]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy [EXC 2117-422037984]; NSF [IOS-1355061]; Office of Naval Research [N00014-09-1-1074, N00014-14-1-0635]; Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin","Andrea von Braun Foundation; Elsa-Neumann-Scholarship; Heidelberg Academy of Science; Zukunftskolleg Mentorship Program; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; Klaus Tschira Foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy(German Research Foundation (DFG)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin(Austrian Science Fund (FWF))","D.M.D. received funding from the Andrea von Braun Foundation, and the Elsa-Neumann-Scholarship.

Exposures can influence prey-predator interactions, courtship and other vital behaviors, leading to individual or population disruption at toxicant levels well below those producing morphological or physiological changes. The few behavioral studies of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on fish behavior have yielded highly inconsistent results, likely relating to chronic vs. acute treatment. A few studies report lethargy and decreased exploratory behavior, while others indicate increased anxiety and greater exploratory behavior with PAH exposure. In our study on zebrafish (Danio rerio), we hypothesized that even relatively brief (30 min) exposure to the PAH benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) would impact group shoaling and individual behaviors in open field and novel object exploration tests. Exposures comprised measured concentrations of 1.0 pM, 10 pM, or 100 pM, B[a]P. Compared to controls, inter-individual distance (IID) was significantly increased by 100 pM B[a]P, but not by 1.0 pM or 10 pM B[a]P. Total distance moved by shoals was decreased significantly at B[a]P concentrations of 1.0 pM, 10 pM and 100 pM. In the open field test of individual locomotion and anxiety-like behavior, time spent in the thigmotaxis zone along the walls of the circular test arena (a proxy for anxiety-like behavior), was decreased at 100 pM. In the novel object approach test to investigate boldness, time spent near the object was significantly increased by both 10 pM and 100 pM B[a]P. Collectively, these data indicate a complex suite of changes in zebrafish including altered shoal dynamics, decreased anxiety, increased boldness, and decreased locomotion associated with exposure to B[a]P.

In particularly the acute and chronic exposures to industrial pollutants on nervous systems and thus potential alterations in ecological fitness remain profoundly understudied. Since the behavioral phenotype is the highest-level and functional manifestation of integrated neurological functions, the alterations in neuro-behavioral traits have been postulated as very sensitive and physiologically integrative endpoints to assess eco-neurotoxioological risks associated with industrial pollutants. Due to a considerable backlog of risk assessments of existing and new production chemicals there is a need for a paradigm shift from high cost, low throughput ecotoxicity test models to next generation systems amenable to higher throughput. In this review we concentrate on emerging aspects of laboratory-based neuro-behavioral phenotyping approaches that can be amenable for rapid prioritizing pipelines. We outline the importance of development and applications of innovative neuro-behavioral assays utilizing small aquatic biological indicators and demonstrate emerging concepts of high-throughput chemo-behavioral phenotyping. We also discuss new analytical approaches to effectively and rapidly evaluate the impact of pollutants on higher behavioral functions such as sensory-motor assays, decision-making and cognitive behaviors using innovative model organisms. Finally, we provide a snapshot of most recent analytical approaches that can be applied to elucidate mechanistic rationale that underlie the observed neuro-behavioral alterations upon exposure to pollutants. This review is intended to outline the emerging opportunities for innovative multidisciplinary research and highlight the existing challenges as well barriers to future development.

A key question is whether the consequences of these pollutants extend beyond mean behavioural changes, restraining differences in behaviour between individuals. In a controlled, two-year, multigenerational experiment with independent mesocosm populations, we exposed guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to environmentally realistic levels of the ubiquitous pollutant fluoxetine (Prozac). Fish (unexposed: n = 59, low fluoxetine: n = 57, high fluoxetine: n = 58) were repeatedly assayed on four separate occasions for activity and risk-taking behaviour. Fluoxetine homogenized individuals' activity, with individual variation in populations exposed to even low concentrations falling to less than half that in unexposed populations. To understand the proximate mechanism underlying these changes, we tested the relative contribution of variation within and between individuals to the overall decline in individual variation. We found strong evidence that fluoxetine erodes variation in activity between but not within individuals, revealing the hidden consequences of a ubiquitous contaminant on phenotypic variation in fish-likely to impair adaptive potential to environmental change.","[Poiverino, Giovanni; Soman, Vrishin R.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Sch Biol Sci, M092,35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Martin, Jake M.; Bertram, Michael G.; Tan, Hung; Brand, Jack A.; Mason, Rachel T.; Wong, Bob B.

In aquatic ecosystems, contamination by trace metals has deleterious effects on fish health and commonly co-occurs with pathogens, which affect similar physiological and behavioral traits. However, the combined effects of metal contamination and parasitism are still poorly known. In addition, the sensitivity to multiple stressors could be highly variable among different fish populations depending on their evolutionary history, but this intraspecific variability is rarely taken into account in existing ecotoxicological studies. Here, we investigated i) the interactive effects of metal contamination (i.e., realistic mixture of Cd, Cu and Zn) and immune challenge mimicking a parasite attack on fish health across biological levels. In addition, we compared ii) the physiological and behavioral responses among five populations of gudgeon fish (Gobio occitaniae) having evolved along a gradient of metal contamination. Results show that single stressors exposure resulted in an increase of immune defenses and oxidative stress at the expense of body mass (contamination) or fish swimming activity (immune challenge). Multiple stressors had fewer interactive effects than expected, especially on physiological traits, but mainly resulted in antagonistic effects on fish swimming activity. Indeed, the immune challenge modified or inhibited the effects of contamination on fish behavior in most populations, suggesting that multiple stressors could reduce behavioral plasticity. Interestingly, the effects of stressors were highly variable among populations, with lower deleterious effects of metal contamination in populations from highly contaminated environments, although the underlying evolutionary mechanisms remain to be investigated. This study highlights the importance of considering multiple stressors effects and intraspecific variability of sensitivity to refine our ability to predict the effects of environmental contaminants on aquatic wildlife.

We compiled a database of two-dimensional movies for very different biological and physical systems spanning a wide range of length scales and developed a general-purpose, optimized, open-source, cross-platform, easy to install and use, self-updating software called FastTrack. It can handle a changing number of deformable objects in a region of interest, and is particularly suitable for animal and cell tracking in two-dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce the probability of incursions as a new measure of a movie's trackability that doesn't require the knowledge of ground truth trajectories, since it is resilient to small amounts of errors and can be computed on the basis of an ad hoc tracking. We also leveraged the versatility and speed of FastTrack to implement an iterative algorithm determining a set of nearly-optimized tracking parameters-yet further reducing the amount of human intervention-and demonstrate that FastTrack can be used to explore the space of tracking parameters to optimize the number of swaps for a batch of similar movies. A benchmark shows that FastTrack is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, with a comparable tracking accuracy. The source code is available under the GNU GPLv3 at and pre-compiled binaries for Windows, Mac and Linux are available at https://github.com/FastTrackOrg/ FastTrack and pre-compiled binaries for Windows, Mac and Linux are available at http:// www.fasttrack.sh. Author summary Many researchers and engineers face the challenge of tracking objects from very different systems across several fields of research. We observed that despite this diversity the core of the tracking task is very general and can be formalized. We thus introduce the notion of incursions-i.e. to what extent an object can enter a neighbor's space-which can be defined on a statistical basis and captures the interplay between the acquisition rate, the objects' dynamics and the geometrical characteristics of the scene, including density. To validate this approach, we compiled a dataset from various fields of Physics, Biology and human activities to serve as a benchmark for general-purpose tracking softwares. This dataset is open and accepts new submissions. We also developped a software called FastTrack that is able to track most of the movies in the dataset by proposing standard image processing tools and state-of-the-art implementation of the matching algorithm, which is at the core of the tracking task. Besides, it is open-source, simple to install and use and has an ergonomic interface to obtain fast and reliable results. FastTrack is particularly convenient for small-scale research projects, typically when the development of a dedicated software is overkill.","[Gallois, Benjamin; Candelier, Raphael] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Inst Biol Paris Seine, Lab Jean Perrin, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Sorbonne Universite,"Candelier, R (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Inst Biol Paris Seine, Lab Jean Perrin, Paris, France.",raphael.candelier@sorbonne-universite.fr,,"Candelier, Raphael/0000-0002-1523-6249",ANR JCJC grant [ANR-16-CE16-0017],ANR JCJC grant(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This work has been financed by an ANR JCJC grant (ANR-16-CE16-0017, https://anr.fr/) received by RC.

Lab-based studies with individual bees or bees in small groups have highlighted many negative effects of miticides on bee behaviour and physiology; hence, there is an urgent need to better understand the consequences of miticides on honey bee colonies in an apicultural setting. Here we compared effects of commercial treatments of the miticides tau-fluvalinate and thymol, and controls, on honey bee colonies and bee foraging behaviour over five months, from autumn through winter in Sydney, Australia. Since V. destructor does not occur in Sydney, in this study, we could isolate the direct effects of the miticides from indirect effects resulting from reduced mite load. We found the autumn treatment of either miticide caused no significant change in bee adult or brood population or size of food stores. The average temperature in the thymol group differed from the temperature in the control group and was lower during winter. Neither miticide reduced bee longevity. Tau-fluvalinate caused bees to start foraging earlier in life and perform shorter trips, but no other effects on foraging behaviour were documented.

Such tests are informative, but cannot ascertain effects of long-term and multigenerational mixed-stressor exposure with which organisms are often confronted in their natural environment. Therefore, full lifecycle and multigenerational tests are needed. Yet, these are hampered due to long lifespans and generation times of many standard laboratory species, in particular for vertebrates such as fish. With a typical lifespan of 6 months and a generation time of about 3 months, the turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) may be an ideal model for multigenerational testing. In this study, we assessed the impact of full life-cycle exposure to the emerging pollutant fluoxetine (0, 0.5 mu g/L) in combination with chronic exposure during adulthood to the pesticide 3,4-dichlomaniline (0, 50, 100 mu g/L) over two successive generations of N. furzeri. Overall, both life-history and behaviour were affected by exposure to fluoxetine and 3,4-DCA. Inhibitory effects of single chemical exposure on growth and fecundity were generation-dependent, while enhanced swimming acceleration and feeding in response to fluoxetine were dependent on the presence of 3,4-DCA. Together, these findings show the relevance of a multi-stressor approach across successive generations. Although full life-cycle and multigenerational tests are typically assumed to be impractical and costly for fish, we deliver an effective demonstration that such studies are possible within a timespan of less than 6 months with the killifish N. furzeri as a model organism.","[Thore, Eli S.

The intensive applications of glyphosate-based herbicides and its half-life in water lead to its presence in many aquatic ecosystems. Whereas recent studies have reported neurotoxic effects of glyphosate including autism related effects, most of them used extremely high (mg/L to g/L) concentrations, so it is still unclear if chronic, low environmentally relevant concentrations of this compound (ng/L to mu g/L) can induce neurotoxicity. In this study we analyzed the neurotoxicity of glyphosate in adult zebrafish after waterborne exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.3 and 3 mu g/L) for two weeks. Our data showed that exposed fish presented a significant impairment of exploratory and social behaviors consistent with increased anxiety. The anterior brain of the exposed fish presented a significant increase in dopamine and serotonin levels, as well as in the DOPAC/dopamine and homovanillic acid/dopamine turnover ratios. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in the dopaminergic system, as th1, th2, comtb, and scl6a3 was downregulated. Finally, the brain of exposed fish presented a significant increase in the catalase and superoxide dismutase activities, with a concomitant decrease of glutathione stores. These changes in the antioxidant defense system are consistent with the observed increase in oxidative stress, reflected by the increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation in the brain. The presented results show that current glyphosate concentrations commonly found in many aquatic ecosystems may have detrimental consequences on fish survival by decreasing exploration of the environment or altering social interactions. Furthermore, as zebrafish is also a vertebrate model widely used in human neurobehavioral studies, these results are relevant not only for environmental risk assessment, but also for understanding the risk of chronic low-dose exposures on human health.","[Faria, Melissa; Bedrossiantz, Juliette; Raldua, Demetrio] CSIC, Inst Environm Assessment & Water Res IDAEA, Jordi Girona 18, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Rosas Ramirez, Jonathan Ricardo; Heredia Garcia, Gerardo; Manuel Gomez-Olivan, Leobardo] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Fac Quim, Lab Toxicol Ambiental, Paseo Colon Intersecc Paseo Tollocan S-N, Toluca 50120, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Mayol, Marta; Bellot, Marina; Gomez-Canela, Cristian] Univ Ramon Llull, Inst Quim Sarria, Sch Engn, Dept Analyt Chem, Via Augusta 390, Barcelona 08017, Spain; [Mayol, Marta; Bellot, Marina; Gomez-Canela, Cristian] Univ Ramon Llull, Inst Quim Sarria, Sch Engn, Appl Chromatog Sect, Via Augusta 390, Barcelona 08017, Spain; [Prats, Eva] CSIC, Res & Dev Ctr CID, Jordi Girona 18, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Garcia-Reyero, Natalia] US Army Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Environm Lab, Vicksburg, MS USA",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Investigacion y Desarrollo Pascual Vila (CID-CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Diagnostico Ambiental y Estudios del Agua (IDAEA); Universitat Ramon Llull; Institut Quimic de Sarria; Universitat Ramon Llull; Institut Quimic de Sarria; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC),"Raldúa, D (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Environm Assessment & Water Res IDAEA, Jordi Girona 18, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",drpqam@cid.csic.es,"Raldua, Demetrio/N-9910-2019; Gómez-Oliván, Leobardo Manuel/AAM-8619-2021; Gómez-Oliván, Leobardo/B-1662-2016; Bedrossiantz, Juliette/IAO-6609-2023; Prats, Eva/K-6434-2014","Raldua, Demetrio/0000-0001-5256-1641; Gómez-Oliván, Leobardo Manuel/0000-0002-7248-3449; Gómez-Oliván, Leobardo/0000-0002-7248-3449; Bedrossiantz, Juliette/0000-0001-6318-6453; Prats, Eva/0000-0001-7838-2027; Bellot, Marina/0000-0002-6256-5205",Spanish Government; FEDER Funds [CTM2017-83242-R]; Catalan Government [2017 SGR_902]; Spanish fellowship [PRE2018-083513],Spanish Government(Spanish Government); FEDER Funds(European Union (EU)); Catalan Government; Spanish fellowship,This work was supported by the Spanish Government with FEDER Funds (CTM2017-83242-R; D.R.) and the network of recognized research groups by the Catalan Government (2017 SGR_902).

Although it is an oversimplification of the ecological interactions, we could consider that a significant part of the decisions taken by organisms are, to some extent, chemically driven. Accordingly, chemical contamination might interfere in the way organisms behave and interact with the environment. Just as any environmental factor, contamination can make a habitat less attractive or even unsuitable to accommodate life, conditioning to some degree the decision of organisms to stay in, or move from, an ecosystem. If we consider that contamination is not always spatially homogeneous and that many organisms can avoid it, the ability of contaminants to repel organisms should also be of concern. Thus, in this critical review, we have discussed the dual role of contamination: toxicity (disruption of the physiological and behavioral homeostasis) vs. repellency (contamination-driven changes in spatial distribution/habitat selection). The discussion is centered on methodologies (forced exposure against non-forced multi-compartmented exposure systems) and conceptual improvements (individual stress due to the toxic effects caused by a continuous exposure against contamination-driven spatial distribution). Finally, we propose an approach in which Stress and Landscape Ecology could be integrated with each other to improve our understanding of the threat contaminants represent to aquatic ecosystems.","[Araujo, Cristiano V.

As a result, species interaction networks (e.g., interactions associated with predation or competition) may be altered in such a way as to bring about large changes in populations and/or communities that may further cascade to disrupt ecosystem function and services. Field studies and experimental outcomes as well as models indicate that indirect effects are most likely to occur in communities in which the strength of interactions and the sensitivity to contaminants differ markedly among species, and that indirect effects will vary over space and time as species composition, trophic structure, and environmental factors vary. However, knowledge of indirect effects is essential to improve understanding of the potential for chemical harm in natural systems. For example, indirect effects may confound laboratory-based ecological risk assessment by enhancing, masking, or spuriously indicating the direct effect of chemical contaminants. Progress to better anticipate and interpret the significance of indirect effects will be made as monitoring programs and long-term ecological research are conducted that facilitate critical experimental field and mesocosm investigations, and as chemical transport and fate models, individual-based direct effects models, and ecosystem/food web models continue to be improved and become better integrated.","[Fleeger, John W.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Fleeger, JW (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",zoflee@lsu.edu,,,,,,,122,14,14,7,46,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9717,,PROCESSES,Processes,DEC,2020,8,12,,,,,,,1659,10.3390/pr8121659,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr8121659,,,18,"Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,PL4RH,,gold,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000603110500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is growing interest to monitor the changes produced in these neurochemicals due to the large number of exogenous agents, such as pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse, targeting and affecting this system. Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) shares the common neurotransmitter pathways and nervous system organization with mammals. Therefore, a method based on liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) has been developed for the first time to study the profile of ten monoaminergic neurochemicals in the anterior, middle and posterior brain regions of adult zebrafish. Moreover, the applied LC-MS/MS method has been studied in terms of quality such as linearity, sensitivity and intra- and inter-day precision. The analytical method based in LC-MS/MS has become a new source in neurotoxicology using adult zebrafish as research model. Significant differences on the levels of these neurotransmitters have been found between the different brain regions.

Consequently, critical conservation questions may be answered too slowly to support decision-making. Recent studies demonstrated the potential for computer vision to dramatically increase efficiency in image-based biodiversity surveys; however, the literature has focused on projects with a large set of labelled training images, and hence many projects with a smaller set of labelled images cannot benefit from existing machine learning techniques. Furthermore, even sizable projects have struggled to adopt computer vision methods because classification models overfit to specific image backgrounds (i.e. camera locations). In this paper, we combine the power of machine intelligence and human intelligence via a novel active learning system to minimize the manual work required to train a computer vision model. Furthermore, we utilize object detection models and transfer learning to prevent overfitting to camera locations. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply an active learning approach to camera trap images. Our proposed scheme can match state-of-the-art accuracy on a 3.2 million image dataset with as few as 14,100 manual labels, which means decreasing manual labelling effort by over 99.5%. Our trained models are also less dependent on background pixels, since they operate only on cropped regions around animals. The proposed active deep learning scheme can significantly reduce the manual labour required to extract information from camera trap images. Automation of information extraction will not only benefit existing camera trap projects, but can also catalyse the deployment of larger camera trap arrays.","[Norouzzadeh, Mohammad Sadegh; Morris, Dan; Beery, Sara] Microsoft AI Earth, Redmond, WA 98052 USA; [Norouzzadeh, Mohammad Sadegh; Clune, Jeff] Univ Wyoming, Comp Sci Dept, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Beery, Sara] CALTECH, Comp Sci Dept, Pasadena, CA USA; [Joshi, Neel; Jojic, Nebojsa] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA USA; [Clune, Jeff] OpenAI, San Francisco, CA USA",University of Wyoming; California Institute of Technology; Microsoft; OpenAI,"Morris, D (corresponding author), Microsoft AI Earth, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.",dan@microsoft.com,,"Beery, Sara/0000-0002-2544-1844; Norouzzadeh, Mohammad Sadegh/0000-0002-2983-9374",,,,,45,66,75,1,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Specific complications arise when the effect sizes of covariates vary on multiple levels (e.g. within vs. among subjects). Mean centring of covariates within subjects offers a useful approach in such situations, but is not without problems. A statistical model represents a hypothesis about the underlying biological process. Mean centring within clusters assumes that the lower level responses (e.g. within subjects) depend on the deviation from the subject mean (relative) rather than on the absolute scale of the covariate. This may or may not be biologically realistic. We show that mismatch between the nature of the generating (i.e. biological) process and the form of the statistical analysis produce major conceptual and operational challenges for empiricists. We explored the consequences of mismatches by simulating data with three response-generating processes differing in the source of correlation between a covariate and the response. These data were then analysed by three different analysis equations. We asked how robustly different analysis equations estimate key parameters of interest and under which circumstances biases arise. Mismatches between generating and analytical equations created several intractable problems for estimating key parameters. The most widely misestimated parameter was the among-subject variance in response. We found that no single analysis equation was robust in estimating all parameters generated by all equations. Importantly, even when response-generating and analysis equations matched mathematically, bias in some parameters arose when sampling across the range of the covariate was limited. Our results have general implications for how we collect and analyse data. They also remind us more generally that conclusions from statistical analysis of data are conditional on a hypothesis, sometimes implicit, for the process(es) that generated the attributes we measure. We discuss strategies for real data analysis in face of uncertainty about the underlying biological process.","[Westneat, David F.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Araya-Ajoy, Yimen G.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam CBD, Trondheim, Norway; [Allegue, Hassen; Reale, Denis] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Class, Barbara] Univ Sunshine Coast, Global Change Ecol Res Grp, Sunshine Coast, Qld, Australia; [Dingemanse, Niels] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol, Behav Ecol, Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Dochtermann, Ned A.] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fargo, ND USA; [Garamszegi, Laszlo Zsolt] Inst Ecol & Bot, Ctr Ecol Res, Vacratot, Hungary; [Garamszegi, Laszlo Zsolt] Eotvos Lorand Univ, MTA ELTE, Theoret Biol & Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, Dept Plant Systemat Ecol & Theoret Biol, Budapest, Hungary; [Martin, Julien G.

However, the MeHg production and bioaccumulation pathways in these ecosystems have not been completely unraveled. We measured Hg concentrations and stable isotope ratios of Hg, carbon, and nitrogen in the feathers and blood of geolocator-tracked little auk Alle alle from five Arctic breeding colonies. The wide-range spatial mobility and tissue-specific Hg integration times of this planktivorous seabird allowed the exploration of their spatial (wintering quarters/breeding grounds) and seasonal (nonbreeding/breeding periods) MeHg exposures. An east-to-west increase of head feather Hg concentrations (1.74-3.48 mu g.g(-1)) was accompanied by significant spatial trends of Hg isotope (particularly Delta Hg-199: 0.96-1.13 parts per thousand) and carbon isotope (delta C-13: -20.6 to -19.4 parts per thousand) ratios. These trends suggest a distinct mixing/proportion of MeHg sources between western North Atlantic and eastern Arctic regions. Higher Delta Hg-199 values (+0.4 parts per thousand) in northern colonies indicate an accumulation of more photochemically impacted MeHg, supporting shallow MeHg production and bioaccumulation in high Arctic waters. The combination of seabird tissue isotopic analysis and spatial tracking helps in tracing the MeHg sources at various spatio-temporal scales.","[Renedo, Marina; Amouroux, David; Berail, Sylvain; Tessier, Emmanuel] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, E2S UPPA, CNRS, Inst Sci Analyt & Physicochim Environm & Mat,IPRE, F-64000 Pau, France; [Renedo, Marina; Albert, Celine; Bustamante, Paco; Fort, Jerome] La Rochelle Univ, CNRS, UMR 7266, Littoral Environm & Soc LIENSs, F-17000 La Rochelle, France; [Brathen, Vegard S.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Gavrilo, Maria] Assoc Maritime Heritage Sustain & Explore, St Petersburg 199106, Russia; [Gremillet, David] La Rochelle Univ, CNRS, UMR 7372, Ctr Etud Biol Chile, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Gremillet, David] Univ Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Percy FitzPatrick Inst, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Helgason, Halfdan H.; Strom, Hallvard] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, N-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Jakubas, Dariusz; Wojczulanis-Jakubas, Katarzyna] Gdansk Univ, Fac Biol, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland; [Mosbech, Anders] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Bustamante, Paco] Inst Univ France IUF, F-75005 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); University of Cape Town; National Research Foundation - South Africa; Norwegian Polar Institute; Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk; Aarhus University; Institut Universitaire de France,"Renedo, M (corresponding author), Univ Pau & Pays Adour, E2S UPPA, CNRS, Inst Sci Analyt & Physicochim Environm & Mat,IPRE, F-64000 Pau, France.;Renedo, M; Fort, J (corresponding author), La Rochelle Univ, CNRS, UMR 7266, Littoral Environm & Soc LIENSs, F-17000 La Rochelle, France.",marina.renedo@ird.fr; jerome.fort@univ-lr.fr,"Jakubas, Dariusz/N-3680-2019; Wojczulanis-Jakubas, Katarzyna/AAO-4126-2021; albert, céline/ABB-8769-2021; Bustamante, Paco/G-5833-2011; Renedo, Marina/ABG-4572-2020; Gavrilo, Maria V/R-7091-2016; David, Amouroux/HSE-7664-2023; Mosbech, Anders/J-6591-2013","Jakubas, Dariusz/0000-0002-1879-4342; Wojczulanis-Jakubas, Katarzyna/0000-0001-6230-0509; albert, céline/0000-0001-8220-0476; Bustamante, Paco/0000-0003-3877-9390; Gavrilo, Maria V/0000-0002-3500-9617; Mosbech, Anders/0000-0002-7581-7037; Renedo Elizalde, Marina/0000-0002-9224-8745","French Agency for National Research [ANR16-TERC-0004, ANR-16-CE34-0005]; French Arctic Initiative.CNRS (PARCS project); Mission pour l'Interdisciplinarite.CNRS (Changements en Siberie project); French Polar Institute [IPEV-Pgr 388 ADACLIM]; IUF (Institut Universitaire de France)",French Agency for National Research; French Arctic Initiative.CNRS (PARCS project); Mission pour l'Interdisciplinarite.CNRS (Changements en Siberie project); French Polar Institute; IUF (Institut Universitaire de France),"The authors wish to thank the field workers who collected the samples.

Digital film recording with subsequent analysis of video sequences using specialised animal tracking software has become a standard in obtaining behavioral biometric data. At present animal tracking algorithms are largely capable of detecting and tracking small number of animals and extracting quantitative endpoints associated with specific behavioral traits based on reconstruction of movement trajectories and occupancy heatmaps. However, despite recent and significant progress in development of diverse proxy biological models, the software algorithms still lack the ability to track multiple organisms on a large scale, automatically generate behavioral fingerprints and utilize intensive computational approaches to mine rich biometric data. This creates a significant bottleneck for effective high-throughput chemobehavioral screening in drug discovery and neurotoxicology.

However, floral scents that pollinating insects rely on to locate host plants may be altered by atmospheric oxidants, such as ozone, potentially making these cues less attractive or unrecognizable to foraging insects and decreasing pollinator efficacy. We demonstrate that levels of tropospheric ozone commonly found in many rural areas are sufficient to disrupt the innate attraction of the tobacco hawkmothManduca sextato the odor of one of its preferred flowers,Nicotiana alata.However, we further find that visual navigation together with associative learning can offset this disruption. Foraging moths that initially find an ozone-altered floral scent unattractive can target an artificial flower using visual cues and associate the ozone-altered floral blend with a nectar reward. The ability to learn ozone-altered floral odors may enable pollinators to maintain communication with their co-evolutionary partners and reduce the negative impacts that anthropogenically elevated oxidants may have on plant-pollinator systems.","[Cook, Brynn; Haverkamp, Alexander; Hansson, Bill S.; Knaden, Markus] Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Evolutionary Neuroethol, Jena, Germany; [Cook, Brynn; Roulston, T'ai] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Boyce, VA USA; [Cook, Brynn; Roulston, T'ai] Univ Virginia, Blandy Expt Farm, Boyce, VA USA; [Haverkamp, Alexander] Wageningen Univ, Lab Entomol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lerdau, Manuel] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Clark Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Lerdau, Manuel] Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA USA",Max Planck Society; University of Virginia; University of Virginia; Wageningen University & Research; University of Virginia; University of Virginia,"Knaden, M (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Evolutionary Neuroethol, Jena, Germany.",mknaden@ice.mpg.de,"Hansson, Bill S/G-2774-2013; Roulston, Tai/AAI-4974-2020; Haverkamp, Alexander/ABY-4499-2022; Knaden, Markus/E-2151-2015","Hansson, Bill S/0000-0002-4811-1223; Roulston, Tai/0000-0002-1220-1315; Haverkamp, Alexander/0000-0003-3512-9659; Knaden, Markus/0000-0002-6710-1071",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open access funding provided by Projekt DEAL.,,56,21,24,2,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0098-0331,1573-1561,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

In areas that are too large to be fully covered by the limited detection ranges of receivers or acoustic listening stations, researchers generally assume that animals are residing in an area when they are detected frequently at specific receivers. There is, however, no consensus on how this area and frequency should be spatially and temporally defined respectively, thereby introducing some unaccounted uncertainty of this residency-at-receivers. In longitudinal aquatic systems such as rivers or estuaries, strategically placed receivers are often used as gates or curtains through which tagged animals have to pass. Rather than being a proxy for the time spent near receivers, the detections can serve as boundary conditions to delineate the durations that animals spent between receivers (i.e. residency-between-receivers). As such, providing a spatial and temporal context to the detections and enabling the quantification of epistemic uncertainty. To assess the usefulness of this approach, we analyzed telemetry data for migrating eel in a longitudinal estuarine acoustic tracking network of 21 gates. Results revealed a logarithmic relationship between epistemic uncertainty and gate network resolution, which indicates that transferring information from the spatial to the temporal level has a positive effect on the epistemic uncertainty. The poor correlation between the at-receivers and the between-receivers approach indicates that the latter, although less precise, may be more accurate. It should be noted that the suggested approach assumes that the gates of receivers are perfect detectors. If tagged animals are able to pass these gates undetected the uncertainty will actually be higher than assumed. Our approach is therefore less suited for large open areas such as lagoons or seas where gates with high detection probabilities are logistically challenging. This approach allows the quantification and reduction of epistemic uncertainty by providing a spatiotemporal context to the detections. Since establishing and maintaining passive telemetry networks is generally expensive and the results these networks generate are often used in decision making, an assessment of the network quality and data uncertainty is vital.","[Bruneel, Stijn; Goethals, Peter] Univ Ghent, Dept Anim Sci & Aquat Ecol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Bruneel, Stijn; Verhelst, Pieterjan; Moens, Tom] Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, Krijgslaan 281, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Reubens, Jan] Flanders Marine Inst VLIZ, Wandektarkaai 7, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium; [Baetens, Jan M.] Univ Ghent, Dept Data Anal & Math Modelling, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Coeck, Johan] Res Inst Nat & Forest INBO, Havenlaan 88,Bus 73, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University; Ghent University; Research Institute for Nature & Forest,"Bruneel, S (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Anim Sci & Aquat Ecol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",stijn.bruneel@ugent.be,"Verhelst, Pieterjan/I-4864-2019; Goethals, Peter LM/A-1116-2008","Verhelst, Pieterjan/0000-0002-2610-6941; Baetens, Jan/0000-0003-4084-9992; Bruneel, Stijn/0000-0002-8226-8080; Moens, Tom/0000-0001-6544-9210",Flemish branch of the Life Watch ESFRI observatory; Flemish Agency for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (VLAIO) under National Science Fund FWO; Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO),Flemish branch of the Life Watch ESFRI observatory; Flemish Agency for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (VLAIO) under National Science Fund FWO; Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO)(FWO),"This work was supported by the Flemish branch of the Life Watch ESFRI observatory.

Biologists therefore use statistical analyses to detect signal among this systemic noise. Statistical models infer trends, find functional relationships and detect differences that exist among groups or are caused by experimental manipulations. They also use statistical relationships to help predict uncertain futures. All branches of the biological sciences now embrace the possibilities of mixed-effects modelling and its flexible toolkit for partitioning noise and signal. The mixed-effects model is not, however, a panacea for poor experimental design, and should be used with caution when inferring or deducing the importance of both fixed and random effects. Here we describe a selection of the perils and pitfalls that are widespread in the biological literature, but can be avoided by careful reflection, modelling and model-checking. We focus on situations where incautious modelling risks exposure to these pitfalls and the drawing of incorrect conclusions. Our stance is that statements of significance, information content or credibility all have their place in biological research, as long as these statements are cautious and well-informed by checks on the validity of assumptions. Our intention is to reveal potential perils and pitfalls in mixed model estimation so that researchers can use these powerful approaches with greater awareness and confidence. Our examples are ecological, but translate easily to all branches of biology.","[Silk, Matthew J.; Harrison, Xavier A.; Hodgson, David J.] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn, Cornwall, England; [Silk, Matthew J.] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, Cornwall, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter,"Silk, MJ; Hodgson, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn, Cornwall, England.;Silk, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, Cornwall, England.",matthewsilk@outlook.com; hodgson@exeter.ac.uk,,"Silk, Matthew/0000-0002-8318-5383; Hodgson, Dave/0000-0003-4220-2076; Harrison, Xavier/0000-0002-2004-3601",University of Exeter,University of Exeter,"This work was funded by the University of Exeter.

Particle source, Lagrangian trajectories and arrivals over time (1, 6, and 10 days) were used as a proxy to determine the exposure potential and vulnerability of different habitats to an array of pharmaceuticals with different environmental degradation rates and half-lives. Then, exposure potential was combined with information on sensitive habitats to identify vulnerable areas in the estuary. Three different freshwater inflow scenarios were considered simulating Medium flow, No flow and flood conditions (High flow). Model results for areas with higher particle density were concordant with concentration hotspots of pharmaceuticals. Higher potential exposure in a larger area of the estuary was observed for the High freshwater flow; yet reduced particles export to adjacent coastal areas highlights the potential of estuaries and bays as particle sinks. In all modeled scenarios, vulnerable areas were predominantly located in the southern bays up to day 6, and later in eastern areas, which include a nature reserve. These areas are largely composed of intertidal soft substratum and salt marshes habitats, and thus warrant prioritization for monitoring and risk assessment of pharmaceuticals exposure in the Tagus estuary due to the higher risk of exposure of a wealth of vertebrate and invertebrate species that use them. This framework allowed the identification of vulnerable areas to pharmaceutical contamination and can be a valuable instrument to plan the location for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in estuaries and coastal areas.","[Fonseca, Vanessa F.; Reis-Santos, Patrick; Duarte, Bernardo; Isabel Cacador, M.; Pais, Miguel P.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-1749016 Campo Grande, Portugal; [Fonseca, Vanessa F.; Pais, Miguel P.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Reis-Santos, Patrick] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Duarte, Bernardo; Isabel Cacador, M.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Vegetal, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Cabral, Henrique N.] Ctr Bordeaux, INRAE, UR EABX, 50 Ave Verdun, F-33612 Cestas, France; [Vaz, Nuno; Dias, Joao M.] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, Dept Fis, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; University of Adelaide; Universidade de Lisboa; INRAE; Universidade de Aveiro,"Fonseca, VF (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-1749016 Campo Grande, Portugal.;Fonseca, VF (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",,"Pais, Miguel Pessanha/B-1537-2012; Vaz, Nuno/GXH-8216-2022; Cabral, Henrique/D-5201-2011; Duarte, Bernardo/H-2001-2011; Dias, João Miguel/F-3292-2010; Reis-Santos, Patrick/M-9972-2019; Fonseca, Vanessa F./B-3696-2012; Vaz, Nuno/F-5552-2010; Cacador, Isabel/C-2618-2012","Pais, Miguel Pessanha/0000-0003-4282-9995; Cabral, Henrique/0000-0002-7646-6208; Duarte, Bernardo/0000-0003-1914-7435; Dias, João Miguel/0000-0002-7613-6241; Reis-Santos, Patrick/0000-0001-9843-9465; Fonseca, Vanessa F./0000-0002-6374-1194; Vaz, Nuno/0000-0002-8484-6948; Cacador, Isabel/0000-0002-4475-6091","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [UIDB/04292/2020, PTDC/MAR-EST/3048/2014]; FCT [SFRH/BPD/95784/2013, DL57/2016/CP1479/CT0024, CEECIND/00511/2017, DL57/2016/CP1479/CT0020]; national funds (OE), through FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P.; CESAM [UID/AMB/50017 - POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007638]; FCT/MCTES through national funds (PIDDAC); FEDER, within the PT2020 Partnership Agreement; FEDER, within the Compete 2020","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); national funds (OE), through FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P.(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); CESAM; FCT/MCTES through national funds (PIDDAC)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER, within the PT2020 Partnership Agreement; FEDER, within the Compete 2020","This study had the support of the Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) via UIDB/04292/2020 and PTDC/MAR-EST/3048/2014.

Bayesian data analysis (BDA) is a powerful tool for making inference from ecological data, but its full potential has yet to be realized. Despite a generally positive trajectory in research surrounding model development and assessment, far too little attention has been given to prior specification. 2. Default priors, a sub-class of non-informative prior distributions that are often chosen without critical thought or evaluation, are commonly used in practice. We believe the fear of being too 'subjective' has prevented many researchers from usinganyprior information in their analyses despite the fact that defending prior choice (informative or not) promotes good statistical practice. 3. In this commentary, we provide an overview of how BDA is currently being used in a random sample of articles, discuss implications for inference if current bad practices continue, and highlight sub-fields where knowledge about the system has improved inference and promoted good statistical practices through the careful and justified use of informative priors. 4. We hope to inspire a renewed discussion about the use of Bayesian priors in Ecology with particular attention paid to specification and justification. We also emphasize thatallpriors are the result of a subjective choice, and should be discussed in that way.","[Banner, Katharine M.] Montana State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Irvine, Kathryn M.] US Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, Bozeman, MT USA; [Rodhouse, Thomas J.] Oregon State Univ Cascades, Natl Pk Serv, Bend, OR USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; Oregon State University; Oregon State University Cascades,"Banner, KM (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",katharine.banner@montana.edu,,"Rodhouse, Thomas/0000-0001-5953-9113; Banner, Katharine/0000-0002-7103-0042",Montana State University through the Institute on Ecosystems [00CRAG0024]; U.S. Geological Survey [00CRAG0024],Montana State University through the Institute on Ecosystems; U.S. Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey),"Any use of trade, firm or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the US Government.

Animals are confronted with many different forms of pollution, including chemicals, light, noise, and heat, and these can disrupt critical biological processes such as reproduction. Impacts on reproductive processes can dramatically reduce the number and quality of offspring produced by exposed individuals, and this can have further repercussions on the ecology and evolution of affected populations. Here, we illustrate how environmental pollutants can affect various components of reproduction in wildlife, including direct impacts on reproductive physiology and development, consequences for gamete quality and function, as well as effects on sexual communication, sexual selection, and parental care. We follow with a discussion of the broader ecological and evolutionary consequences of these effects on reproduction and suggest future directions that may enable us to better understand and address the effects of environmental pollution.","[Aulsebrook, Lucinda C.; Bertram, Michael G.; Martin, Jake M.; Hall, Matthew D.; O'Bryan, Moira K.; Wong, Bob B.

Increasingly, pharmaceutical pollutants are documented to disrupt ecologically important physiological and behavioural traits in exposed wildlife. However, little is known about potential impacts of pharmaceutical exposure on among-individual variation in these traits, despite phenotypic diversity being critical for population resilience to environmental change. Furthermore, although wildlife commonly experience multiple stressors contemporaneously, potential interactive effects between pharmaceuticals and biological stressorsdsuch as predation threatdremain poorly understood. To redress this, we investigated the impacts of long-term exposure to the pervasive pharmaceutical pollutant fluoxetine (Prozac (R)) on among-individual variation in metabolic and behavioural traits, and the combined impacts of fluoxetine exposure and predation threat on mean metabolic and behavioural traits in a freshwater fish, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Using a mesocosm system, guppy populations were exposed for 15 months to one of two field-realistic levels of fluoxetine (nominal concentrations: 30 and 300 ng/L) or a solvent control. Fish from these populations were then tested for metabolic rate (oxygen uptake) and behaviour (activity), both before and after experiencing one of three levels of a predation treatment: an empty tank, a non-predatory fish (Melanotaenia splendida) or a predatory fish (Leiopotherapon unicolor). Guppies from both fluoxetine treatments had similar to 70% lower among-individual variation in their activity levels, compared to unexposed fish. Similarly, fluoxetine exposure at the higher dosage was associated with a significant (26%) reduction in individual-level variation in oxygen uptake relative to unexposed fish. In addition, mean baseline metabolic rate was disrupted in low-fluoxetine exposed fish, although mean metabolic and behavioural responses to predation threat were not affected. Overall, our study demonstrates that long-term exposure to a pervasive pharmaceutical pollutant alters ecologically relevant traits in fish and erodes among-individual variability, which may be detrimental to the stability of contaminated populations globally.

Detailed track analysis, combined with translocation experiments and exhaustive mapping of fruit trees, revealed that wild bats seldom exhibit random search but instead repeatedly forage in goal-directed, long, and straight flights that include frequent shortcuts. Alternative, non-map-based strategies were ruled out by simulations, time-lag embedding, and other trajectory analyses. Our results are consistent with expectations from cognitive map-like navigation and support previous neurobiological evidence from captive bats.","[Toledo, Sivan] Tel Aviv Univ, Blavatnik Sch Comp Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Shohami, David; Schiffner, Ingo; Lourie, Emmanuel; Orchan, Yotam; Bartan, Yoav; Nathan, Ran] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Sci, Alexander Silberman Inst Life Sci, Movement Ecol Lab,Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, Jerusalem, Israel; [Schiffner, Ingo] Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Deniol Rd, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales",Tel Aviv University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Bangor University,"Toledo, S (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Blavatnik Sch Comp Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel.;Shohami, D; Nathan, R (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Sci, Alexander Silberman Inst Life Sci, Movement Ecol Lab,Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, Jerusalem, Israel.",stoledo@tau.ac.il; david.shohami@mail.huji.ac.il; ran.nathan@mail.huji.ac.il,"Schiffner, Ingo/M-5114-2018; Nathan, Ran/A-9380-2008","Schiffner, Ingo/0000-0003-0044-1677; Nathan, Ran/0000-0002-5733-6715; Shohami, David/0000-0002-7147-5578; Lourie, Emmanuel/0000-0001-7364-0082",Minerva Center for Movement Ecology; Minerva Foundation; ISF grant [ISF-965/15]; Adelina and Massimo Della Pergola Chair of Life Sciences; Israel President Scholarship; [ISF-1316/05]; [ISF-1259/09]; [GIF 1316/15],Minerva Center for Movement Ecology; Minerva Foundation; ISF grant; Adelina and Massimo Della Pergola Chair of Life Sciences; Israel President Scholarship; ; ;,"ATLAS development, maintenance, and studies have been supported by the Minerva Center for Movement Ecology, the Minerva Foundation, and ISF grant ISF-965/15; bat research in the movement ecology lab was supported also by grants from ISF-1316/05, ISF-1259/09, and GIF 1316/15.

However, despite wild animals living in complex multi-stressor environments, interactions between pharmaceutical exposure and other stressors remain poorly understood. Accordingly, we investigated effects of long-term exposure to the pervasive pharmaceutical contaminant fluoxetine (Prozac) and acute temperature stress on reproductive behaviors and activity levels in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Fish were exposed to environmentally realistic fluoxetine concentrations (measured average: 38 or 312 ng/L) or a solvent control for 15 months using a mesocosm system. Additionally, fish were subjected to one of three acute (24 h) temperature treatments: cold stress (18 degrees C), heat stress (32 degrees C), or a control (24 degrees C). We found no evidence for interactive effects of fluoxetine exposure and temperature stress on guppy behavior. However, both stressors had independent impacts. Fluoxetine exposure resulted in increased male coercive copulatory behavior, while fish activity levels were unaffected. Under cold-temperature stress, both sexes were less active and males exhibited less frequent reproductive behaviors. Our results demonstrate that long-term exposure to a common pharmaceutical pollutant and acute temperature stress alter fundamental fitness-related behaviors in fish, potentially shifting population dynamics in contaminated ecosystems.","[Wiles, Sarah C.; Bertram, Michael G.; Martin, Jake M.; Tan, Hung; Lehtonen, Topi K.; Wong, Bob B.

It supports data-driven learning, which can result in automated decision making of de novo data. It has significant advantages compared with manual analyses that are labour intensive and require considerable time. Machine learning approaches have great potential to improve the quality and extent of marine research by identifying latent patterns and hidden trends, particularly in large datasets that are intractable using other approaches. New sensor technology supports collection of large amounts of data from the marine environment. The rapidly developing machine learning subfield known as deep learning-which applies algorithms (artificial neural networks) inspired by the structure and function of the brain-is able to solve very complex problems by processing big datasets in a short time, sometimes achieving better performance than human experts. Given the opportunities that machine learning can provide, its integration into marine science and marine resource management is inevitable. The purpose of this themed set of articles is to provide as wide a selection as possible of case studies that demonstrate the applications, utility, and promise of machine learning in marine science. We also provide a forward-look by envisioning a marine science of the future into which machine learning has been fully incorporated.","[Beyan, Cigdem] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Pattern Anal & Comp Vis, Via Enrico Melen 83, I-16152 Genoa, Italy; [Browman, Howard, I] Ecosyst Acoust Grp, Inst Marine Res, Austevoll Res Stn, Sauganeset 16, N-5392 Storebo, Norway",Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT; Institute of Marine Research - Norway,"Beyan, C (corresponding author), Ist Italiano Tecnol, Pattern Anal & Comp Vis, Via Enrico Melen 83, I-16152 Genoa, Italy.",cigdem.beyan@iit.it,"Beyan, Cigdem/AAA-4235-2019; Browman, Howard/CAA-2802-2022","Beyan, Cigdem/0000-0002-9583-0087; Browman, Howard/0000-0002-6282-7316","Institute of Marine Research, Norway [83741]","Institute of Marine Research, Norway","HIB's contribution to this article themed set was supported by Project #83741 (Scientific publishing and editing) from the Institute of Marine Research, Norway.",,73,31,36,5,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1054-3139,1095-9289,,ICES J MAR SCI,ICES J.

In these data, movement ecologists often view unexplained variation around the mean as noise when studying patterns at the population level. In the field of behavioral ecology, however, focus has shifted from population means to the biological underpinnings of variation around means. Specifically, behavioral ecologists use repeated measures of individual behavior to partition behavioral variability into intrinsic among-individual variation and reversible behavioral plasticity and to quantify: a) individual variation in behavioral types (i.e. different average behavioral expression), b) individual variation in behavioral plasticity (i.e. different responsiveness of individuals to environmental gradients), c) individual variation in behavioral predictability (i.e. different residual within-individual variability of behavior around the mean), and d) correlations among these components and correlations in suites of behaviors, called 'behavioral syndromes'. We here suggest that partitioning behavioral variability in animal movements will further the integration of movement ecology with other fields of behavioral ecology. We provide a literature review illustrating that individual differences in movement behaviors are insightful for wildlife and conservation studies and give recommendations regarding the data required for addressing such questions. In the accompanying R tutorial we provide a guide to the statistical approaches quantifying the different aspects of among-individual variation. We use movement data from 35 African elephants and show that elephants differ in a) their average behavior for three common movement behaviors, b) the rate at which they adjusted movement over a temporal gradient, and c) their behavioral predictability (ranging from more to less predictable individuals). Finally, two of the three movement behaviors were correlated into a behavioral syndrome (d), with farther moving individuals having shorter mean residence times. Though not explicitly tested here, individual differences in movement and predictability can affect an individual's risk to be hunted or poached and could therefore open new avenues for conservation biologists to assess population viability. We hope that this review, tutorial, and worked example will encourage movement ecologists to examine the biology of individual variation in animal movements hidden behind the population mean.","[Hertel, Anne G.; Mueller, Thomas] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr SBiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hertel, Anne G.] Univ South Eastern Norway, Dept Nat Sci & Environm Hlth, N-3800 Bo I Telemark, Norway; [Niemela, Petri T.; Dingemanse, Niels J.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol, Behav Ecol, Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Mueller, Thomas] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Biol Sci, Max von Laue Str 9, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany",Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); University of Munich; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Hertel, AG (corresponding author), Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr SBiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.;Hertel, AG (corresponding author), Univ South Eastern Norway, Dept Nat Sci & Environm Hlth, N-3800 Bo I Telemark, Norway.",anne.hertel@senckenberg.de,"Dingemanse, Niels/ABE-6880-2020; Mueller, Thomas/A-1740-2014","Dingemanse, Niels/0000-0003-3320-0861; Niemela, Petri/0000-0002-7518-4057; Mueller, Thomas/0000-0001-9305-7716; Hertel, Anne/0000-0001-7952-8243","European Union [793077]; German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development [I-1465-413.13/2018]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [NI 1539/2-1, DI 1694/1-1]; Robert Bosch Foundation; NIH [GM083863]; USFWS; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [793077] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)",European Union(European Union (EU)); German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development(German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Robert Bosch Foundation; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); USFWS(US Fish & Wildlife Service); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),"AH has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 793077 and from the German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development (I-1465-413.13/2018).

For resource managers to develop the most effective conservation strategies, it is especially important to examine how turtles use and select for habitats within their developmental foraging grounds. Here, we examine the space use and relative habitat selection of immature green turtles (Chelonia mydas) using acoustic telemetry within the marine protected area, Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands.ResultsSpace use by turtles was concentrated on the southern side of Buck Island, but also extended to the northeast and northwest areas of the island, as indicated by minimum convex polygons (MCPs) and 99%, 95%, and 50% kernel density estimations (KDEs). On average space use for all categories was<3 km(2) with mean KDE area overlap ranging from 41.9 to 67.7%. Cumulative monthly MCPs and their proportions to full MCPs began to stabilize 3 to 6 detection months after release, respectively. Resource selection functions (RSFs) were implemented using a generalized linear mixed effects model with turtle ID as the random effect. After model selection, the accuracy of the top model was 77.3% and showed relative habitat selection values were highest at shallow depths, for areas in close proximity to seagrass, and in reef zones for both day and night, and within lagoon zones at night. The top model was also extended to predict across BIRNM at both day and night.ConclusionMore traditional acoustic telemetry analyses in combination with RSFs provide novel insights into animal space use and relative resource selection. Here, we demonstrated immature green turtles within the BIRNM have small, specific home ranges and core use areas with temporally varying relative selection strengths across habitat types. We conclude the BIRNM marine protected area is providing sufficient protection for immature green turtles, however, habitat protection could be focused in both areas of high space use and in locations where high relative selection values were determined. Ultimately, the methodologies and results presented here may help to design strategies to expand habitat protection for immature green turtles across their greater distribution.","[Griffin, Lucas P.; Danylchuk, Andy J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Smith, Brian J.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, 5230 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Cherkiss, Michael S.; Crowder, Andrew G.; Hart, Kristen M.] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Davie, FL 33314 USA; [Pollock, Clayton G.; Hillis-Starr, Zandy] Natl Pk Serv, St Croix, VI 00820 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior,"Griffin, LP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",lucaspgriffin@gmail.com,"Smith, Brian J./AAV-7609-2020","Smith, Brian J./0000-0002-0531-0492; Griffin, Lucas/0000-0002-8560-0683",USGS Natural Resource Protection Program (NRPP),USGS Natural Resource Protection Program (NRPP),We acknowledge the USGS Natural Resource Protection Program (NRPP) for funding.,,87,14,15,2,11,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2050-3385,,ANIM BIOTELEM,Anim.

Aquatic movement ecology can therefore be limited in taxonomic range and ecological coverage. Methods Here we present a novel deep-learning based, multi-individual tracking approach, which incorporates Structure-from-Motion in order to determine the 3D location, body position and the visual environment of every recorded individual. The application is based on low-cost cameras and does not require the animals to be confined, manipulated, or handled in any way. Results Using this approach, single individuals, small heterospecific groups and schools of fish were tracked in freshwater and marine environments of varying complexity. Positional tracking errors as low as 1.09 +/- 0.47 cm (RSME) in underwater areas up to 500 m(2)were recorded. Conclusions This cost-effective and open-source framework allows the analysis of animal behaviour in aquatic systems at an unprecedented resolution. Implementing this versatile approach, quantitative behavioural analysis can be employed in a wide range of natural contexts, vastly expanding our potential for examining non-model systems and species.","[Francisco, Fritz A.; Nuehrenberg, Paul; Jordan, Alex] Univ Konstanz, Ctr Adv Study Collect Behav, Univ Str 10, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Francisco, Fritz A.; Nuehrenberg, Paul; Jordan, Alex] Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Collect Behav, Univ Str 10, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Francisco, Fritz A.; Nuehrenberg, Paul; Jordan, Alex] Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Biol, Univ Str 10, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz; Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society,"Nührenberg, P (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Ctr Adv Study Collect Behav, Univ Str 10, D-78457 Constance, Germany.;Nührenberg, P (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Collect Behav, Univ Str 10, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",paul.nuehrenberg@uni-konstanz.de,"Nührenberg, Paul/AAZ-8357-2020; Francisco, Fritz/AAA-3341-2022","Nührenberg, Paul/0000-0001-6352-3560; Francisco, Fritz/0000-0002-8258-2221","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy [EXC 2117 - 422037984]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This project was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy -EXC 2117 -422037984.",,64,29,29,2,25,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2051-3933,,,MOV ECOL,Mov.

This technique increases the efficiency of peak separation in chromatographic analysis, minimizing problems due to the presence of interfering compounds in the analysis, especially in complex matrices. In Latin America, it has been applied to different areas of study. However, biological samples have been reported in a small number of applications. This mini-review addresses studies where the multi and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography technique have been applied to biological samples' analyses. Biological matrices are generally complex, and sample preparation usually requires a large number of steps to minimize potential interferences. The main areas of study described were related to doping control analysis and biomarker analysis. The urine sample was the main type of biological sample used in the studies. Studies have shown that results obtained by two-dimensional gas chromatography or supported or not by mathematical tools allow high efficiency in solving problems such as coelution. However, the small number of works published with the participation of Latin American researchers indicate that equipment price, especially when mass spectrometry is used as a detector, has a limiting factor in its wide application.","[Moreira Fernandez, Miriany Avelino] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Quim, Campus Univ,Caixa Postal 3037, BR-37200900 Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Andre, Leiliane Coelho] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, FAFAR, Dept Anal Clin & Toxicol, Av Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Cardeal, Zenilda de Lourdes] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Quim, ICEx, Av Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Lavras; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Fernandez, MAM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Quim, Campus Univ,Caixa Postal 3037, BR-37200900 Lavras, MG, Brazil.",miriany.fernandez@ufla.br,"Cardeal, Zenilda/Y-7356-2019","Cardeal, Zenilda/0000-0003-1383-6299",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); SVS-Ministerio da Saude,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); SVS-Ministerio da Saude,"This study was funded by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG), and the SVS-Ministerio da Saude.",,47,1,1,0,22,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0009-5893,1612-1112,,CHROMATOGRAPHIA,Chromatographia,2020 SEP,2020,83,9,,,,,1045,1053,,10.1007/s10337-020-03910-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-020-03910-2,,JUN 2020,9,"Biochemical Research Methods; Chemistry, Analytical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,NH8VM,,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000538698100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Increased accessibility to underwater recording equipment such as action cameras and unmanned underwater devices has allowed footage to be captured efficiently and safely, without the logistical difficulties manual data collection often presents. It has, however, led to immense volumes of data being collected that require manual processing and thus significant time, labor, and money. The use of deep learning to automate image processing has substantial benefits but has rarely been adopted within the field of aquatic ecology. To test its efficacy and utility, we compared the accuracy and speed of deep learning techniques against human counterparts for quantifying fish abundance in underwater images and video footage. We collected footage of fish assemblages in seagrass meadows in Queensland, Australia. We produced three models using an object detection framework to detect the target species, an ecologically important fish, luderick (Girella tricuspidata). Our models were trained on three randomized 80:20 ratios of training:validation datasets from a total of 6,080 annotations. The computer accurately determined abundance from videos with high performance using unseen footage from the same estuary as the training data (F1 = 92.4%, mAP50 = 92.5%) and from novel footage collected from a different estuary (F1 = 92.3%, mAP50 = 93.4%). The computer's performance in determining abundance was 7.1% better than human marine experts and 13.4% better than citizen scientists in single image test datasets, and 1.5 and 7.8% higher in video datasets, respectively. We show that deep learning can be a more accurate tool than humans at determining abundance and that results are consistent and transferable across survey locations. Deep learning methods provide a faster, cheaper, and more accurate alternative to manual data analysis methods currently used to monitor and assess animal abundance and have much to offer the field of aquatic ecology.","[Ditria, Ellen M.; Lopez-Marcano, Sebastian; Sievers, Michael; Jinks, Eric L.; Connolly, Rod M.] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Australian Rivers Inst Coast & Estuaries, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Brown, Christopher J.] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Australian Rivers Inst Coast & Estuaries, Nathan, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Griffith University,"Ditria, EM (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Australian Rivers Inst Coast & Estuaries, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.",ellen.ditria@griffithuni.edu.au,"Lopez-Marcano, Sebastian/GQZ-5338-2022; Brown, Christopher J/G-4287-2011; Sievers, Michael/ABA-5513-2020; Connolly, Rod/C-4094-2008","Brown, Christopher J/0000-0002-7271-4091; Sievers, Michael/0000-0001-7162-1830; Connolly, Rod/0000-0001-6223-1291; Lopez-Marcano, Sebastian/0000-0002-0814-2906",Discovery Early Career Researcher Award from the Australian Research Council [DE160101207]; Australian Research Council [DP180103124]; Global Wetlands Project,Discovery Early Career Researcher Award from the Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Global Wetlands Project,CB was supported by a Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DE160101207) from the Australian Research Council.

Particular attention has been given to the strategies of visual predators that actively pursue their prey, but sit-and-wait predators have been largely overlooked, their strategies often characterized as stereotyped. Praying mantids are primarily sit-and-wait predators that often employ crypsis to catch their prey using a raptorial strike produced by their highly modified forelimbs. Here, we show that the raptorial strike of the Madagascan marbled mantis (Polyspilota aeruginosa) varies in duration from 60 to 290 ms due to the tibial extension alone; slower strikes involve slower tibial extensions that may also be interrupted by a pause. The success of a strike is independent of its duration or the presence of these pauses. However, prey speed affects the duration of tibial extension and the probability of a pause occurring, both increasing at slower prey speeds. Adjusting the duration of the tibial extension according to prey speed allows mantids to time the final downward sweep of the tibia to their prey's approach. The use of visual inputs to adjust the motor pattern controlling forelimb movements shows that not all aspects of the strike are stereotyped and that sit-and-wait predators can produce behavioural flexibility.","[Rossoni, Sergio; Niven, Jeremy E.] Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England; [Rossoni, Sergio] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England",University of Sussex; University of Cambridge,"Rossoni, S; Niven, JE (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England.;Rossoni, S (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",sr779@cam.ac.uk; j.e.niven@sussex.ac.uk,"Rossoni, Sergio/ABB-8367-2021","Rossoni, Sergio/0000-0003-0709-9173","University of Sussex, UK","University of Sussex, UK","S.R. was funded by the Sussex Graduate Scholarship, from the University of Sussex, UK.",,52,10,11,1,21,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1744-9561,1744-957X,,BIOL LETTERS,Biol.

Multiple-stressor research is a rapidly expanding field of science that seeks to understand and ultimately predict the interactions between stressors. Reviews and meta-analyses of the primary scientific literature have largely been specific to either freshwater, marine or terrestrial ecology, or ecotoxicology. In this cross-disciplinary study, we review the state of knowledge within and among these disciplines to highlight commonality and division in multiple-stressor research. Our review goes beyond a description of previous research by using quantitative bibliometric analysis to identify the division between disciplines and link previously disconnected research communities. Towards a unified research framework, we discuss the shared goal of increased realism through both ecological and temporal complexity, with the overarching aim of improving predictive power. In a rapidly changing world, advancing our understanding of the cumulative ecological impacts of multiple stressors is critical for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. Identifying and overcoming the barriers to interdisciplinary knowledge exchange is necessary in rising to this challenge. Division between ecosystem types and disciplines is largely a human creation. Species and stressors cross these borders and so should the scientists who study them.","[Orr, James A.; Penk, Marcin R.; Piggott, Jeremy J.] Univ Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Vinebrooke, Rolf D.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Jackson, Michelle C.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Kroeker, Kristy J.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Kordas, Rebecca L.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus, London, Berks, England; [Mantyka-Pringle, Chrystal] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Mantyka-Pringle, Chrystal] Wildlife Conservat Soc Canada, Whitehorse, YT, Canada; [Van den Brink, Paul J.] Wageningen Univ, Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Van den Brink, Paul J.] Wageningen Environm Res, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [De Laender, Frederik] Univ Namur, Namur Inst Complex Syst, Res Unit Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Rue Bruxelles 61, B-5000 Namur, Belgium; [De Laender, Frederik] Univ Namur, Inst Life Earth & Environm, Rue Bruxelles 61, B-5000 Namur, Belgium; [Stoks, Robby] Univ Leuven, Evolutionary Stress Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Leuven, Belgium; [Holmstrup, Martin] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Silkeborg, Denmark; [Matthaei, Christoph D.] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Monk, Wendy A.] Univ New Brunswick, Fac Forestry & Environm Management, Canadian Rivers Inst, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Fredericton, NB, Canada; [Leuzinger, Sebastian] Auckland Univ Technol, Inst Appl Ecol, Auckland, New Zealand; [Schaefer, Ralf B.] Univ Koblenz Landau, iES Inst Environm Sci, Quantitat Landscape Ecol, Landau, Germany",Trinity College Dublin; University of Alberta; University of Oxford; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Imperial College London; University of Saskatchewan; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; University of Namur; University of Namur; KU Leuven; Aarhus University; University of Otago; University of New Brunswick; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Auckland University of Technology; University of Koblenz & Landau,"Piggott, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",jeremy.piggott@tcd.ie,"Schaefer, Ralf/E-1926-2011; van den brink, Paul/AAT-7144-2020; Vinebrooke, Rolf/A-3766-2014; Holmstrup, Martin/E-8731-2017; Orr, James/AAW-6576-2020; Piggott, Jeremy/K-6157-2017; De Laender, Frederik/D-2783-2014; Holmstrup, Martin/I-7463-2013","Schaefer, Ralf/0000-0003-3510-1701; van den brink, Paul/0000-0002-7241-4347; Orr, James/0000-0002-6531-5623; Jackson, Michelle/0000-0003-2227-1111; Kroeker, Kristy/0000-0002-5766-1999; Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459; Piggott, Jeremy/0000-0002-1515-1878; De Laender, Frederik/0000-0002-4060-973X; Holmstrup, Martin/0000-0001-8395-6582",Irish Research Council Laureate Award [IRCLA/2017/112]; TCD Provost's PhD Award; DFG; University of Koblenz-Landau; Irish Research Council (IRC) [IRCLA/2017/112] Funding Source: Irish Research Council (IRC),"Irish Research Council Laureate Award(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); TCD Provost's PhD Award; DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); University of Koblenz-Landau; Irish Research Council (IRC)(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)",J.A.O. was funded by an Irish Research Council Laureate Award (IRCLA/2017/112) and TCD Provost's PhD Award held by J.J.P. during the writing of this review.

Based on recent literature in fish, we highlight four interesting research perspectives to better understand the effects of pollutants on the links between fish behavior, cognition and fitness. First, (1) we review the neurotoxic effects of pollutants on fish behavior, personality, and cognition. These behavioral and cognitive effects could in turn affect the level of exposure to pollutants, potentially generating feedback loops that may amplify the effects of pollutants on fish fitness. Second, we propose that (2) the effects of pollutants should be studied in a multistress context, i.e., in realistic environmental conditions in combination with other stressors, because some stressors could amplify the behavioral effects of pollutants on fitness. Third (3), existing studies show that physiology, personality, cognition, and fitness components are often linked in syndromes. Pollutants could lead to syndrome disruption, which could affect the evolutionary trajectories of exposed populations. Future studies should thus focus on the complex links between traits to better understand the consequences of stressors on evolutionary trajectories. Fourth, (4) exposure to chronic pollution could lead to local adaptation or maladaptation, which could result into high intraspecific variability of sensitivity among wild populations. In addition, evolutionary responses to pollution could constrain, or be constrained by evolutionary responses to other stressors. We thus encourage future studies to use integrative approaches to bridge the gap between ecotoxicology, cognitive ecology and evolutionary ecology in a multistress framework to tackle these exciting questions and improve our ability to predict the effects of anthropogenic stressors on wildlife.","[Jacquin, Lisa; Petitjean, Quentin; Cote, Jessica] Univ Toulouse, UPS, CNRS, IRD,Lab EDB Evolut & Divers Biol UMR 5174, Toulouse, France; [Jacquin, Lisa; Jean, Severine] Zone Atelier PYGAR Pyrenees Garonne, LTSER France, Auzeville Tolosane, France; [Petitjean, Quentin; Laffaille, Pascal; Jean, Severine] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, UPS, Lab EcoLab UMR 5245,INPT ENSAT, Castanet Tolosan, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Jacquin, L (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, UPS, CNRS, IRD,Lab EDB Evolut & Divers Biol UMR 5174, Toulouse, France.;Jacquin, L (corresponding author), Zone Atelier PYGAR Pyrenees Garonne, LTSER France, Auzeville Tolosane, France.",lisa.jacquin@univ-tlse3.fr,"Petitjean, Quentin/AAE-8204-2021","Petitjean, Quentin/0000-0003-2708-7831; Jacquin, Lisa/0000-0002-0521-6113","Agence de l'Eau Adour-Garonne (PHYPAT project); CNRS EC2CO ECODYN program; ZA PYGAR (CNRS); CPER ECONAT; Laboratory of Excellence TULIP [ANR-10-LABX-41, ANR-11-IDEX-0002-02]",Agence de l'Eau Adour-Garonne (PHYPAT project); CNRS EC2CO ECODYN program; ZA PYGAR (CNRS); CPER ECONAT; Laboratory of Excellence TULIP,"This work was supported by a grant from Agence de l'Eau Adour-Garonne (PHYPAT project), the CNRS EC2CO ECODYN program, the ZA PYGAR (CNRS) and the CPER ECONAT.

Experiments exposing fishes and invertebrates to constant concentrations of microplastics often yield high variation in particle ingestion rates among individuals. Yet, despite an increasing interest in microplastic ingestion in the wild, the potential intrinsic drivers of inter-individual variation have received little attention so far. Here we assessed individual-level ingestion of Polyethylene microspheres by laboratory-reared juvenile anemonefish, Amphiprion ocellaris, in relation to (a) ambient particle concentrations and (b) repeatable behavioural traits. We show that microplastic ingestion is highly variable at all tested particle concentrations and that this variation can partially be explained by individual activity levels. Moreover, the relationship between ingestion and behavioural variation increased notably when only the most behaviourally consistent individuals (n = 40 out of 60) were considered in the analysis. Our findings indicate that microplastic ingestion rates in juvenile reef fishes may be less dependent on ambient concentrations than expected; instead they are to some degree phenotype-dependent. Care should thus be taken when reporting mean responses to microplastic exposure treatments, because some individuals may not be affected in the same way as others due to differential ingestion behaviour. We also discuss potential ramifications of non-random ingestion variability on population- and community-level responses. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Chemical pollution has been mentioned as one of the planetary boundaries within which humanity can safely operate, but is not comprehensively understood. Here, 22 chemical inventories from 19 countries and regions are analyzed to achieve a first comprehensive overview of chemicals on the market as an essential first step toward a global understanding of chemical pollution. Over 350 000 chemicals and mixtures of chemicals have been registered for production and use, up to three times as many as previously estimated and with substantial differences across countries/regions. A noteworthy finding is that the identities of many chemicals remain publicly unknown because they are claimed as confidential (over 50 000) or ambiguously described (up to 70 000). Coordinated efforts by all stakeholders including scientists from different disciplines are urgently needed, with (new) areas of interest and opportunities highlighted here.","[Wang, Zhanyun] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, Chair Ecol Syst Design, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Walker, Glen W.] Australian Govt, Dept Environm & Energy, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Muir, Derek C.

TGP evolved to help organisms cope with environmental stressors when parental environments are highly predictive of offspring environments. HIREC can alter conditions that favored TGP in historical environments by reducing parents' ability to detect environmental con ditions, disrupting previous correlations between parental and offspring environments, one interfering with the transmission of parental cues to offspring. Because of the propensity to pro duce errors in these processes, TGP will likely generate negative fitness outcomes in response to HIREC, though beneficial fitness outcomes may occur in some cases.","[Donelan, Sarah C.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, 647 Contees Wharf Rd, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Hellmann, Jennifer K.; Bell, Alison M.] Univ Illinois, Program Neurosci Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Carl R Woese Inst Genom Biol, Dept Evolut Ecol & Behav, 505 South Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Luttbeg, Barney] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, 501 Life Sdences West, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Orrock, John L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, 145 Noland Hall,250 North Mills St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Sheriff, Michael J.] Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Biol Dept, Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA; [Sih, Andrew] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Massachusetts System; University Massachusetts Dartmouth; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Hellmann, JK (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Program Neurosci Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Carl R Woese Inst Genom Biol, Dept Evolut Ecol & Behav, 505 South Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",hellmann@illinois.edu,"; Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Hellmann, Jennifer/0000-0003-0479-3960; Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663; Donelan, Sarah/0000-0002-4066-7884","National Institutes of Health NRSA fellowship [F32GM121033]; Smithsonian Institutional Postdoctoral Fellowship; NSF [IOS-1121980, 191100, IOS-1557831, IOS-1456724]; NIH [2R01GM082937-06A1]",National Institutes of Health NRSA fellowship(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Smithsonian Institutional Postdoctoral Fellowship; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"We thank M.

The peer-reviewed literature now contains studies investigating the effects of chemicals, including pesticides and pharmaceuticals, on migration, dispersal, aggression, sociability, reproduction, feeding and anti-predator behaviours in vertebrates and invertebrates. To understand how behavioural studies could be used in regulatory decision-making we: (1) assessed the legal obstacles to using behavioural endpoints in EU chemicals regulation; (2) analysed the known cases of use of behavioural endpoints in EU chemicals regulation; and (3) provided examples of behavioural endpoints of relevance for population level effects. We conclude that the only legal obstacle to the use of behavioural endpoints in EU chemicals regulation is whether an endpoint is considered to be relevant at the population level or not. We also conclude that ecotoxicity studies investigating behavioural endpoints are occasionally used in the EU chemicals regulation, and underscore that behavioural endpoints can be relevant at the population level. To improve the current use of behavioural studies in regulatory decision-making contribution from all relevant stakeholders is required. We have the following recommendations: (1) researchers should conduct robust, well-designed and transparent studies that emphasize the relevance of the study for regulation of chemicals; (2) editors and scientific journals should promote detailed, reliable and clearly reported studies; (3) regulatory agencies and the chemical industry need to embrace new behavioural endpoints of relevance at the population level.","[Agerstrand, Marlene] Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci ACES, Stockholm, Sweden; [Arnold, Kathryn] Univ York, Dept Environm & Geog, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Balshine, Sigal] McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Brodin, Tomas; McCallum, Erin S.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, Umea, Sweden; [Brooks, Bryan W.] Baylor Univ, Inst Biomed Studies, Dept Environm Sci, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Brooks, Bryan W.] Jinan Univ, Sch Environm, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Maack, Gerd] German Environm Agcy UBA, Dept Pharmaceut, Dessau, Germany; [Pyle, Greg] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Biol Sci, Lethbridge, AB, Canada; [Saaristo, Minna] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Ford, Alex T.] Univ Portsmouth, Inst Marine Sci, Portsmouth, Hants, England",Stockholm University; University of York - UK; McMaster University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Baylor University; Jinan University; University of Lethbridge; Monash University; University of Portsmouth,"Ågerstrand, M (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci ACES, Stockholm, Sweden.",marlene.agerstrand@aces.su.se,"Ford, Alex/C-3522-2008; Ågerstrand, Marlene/F-9924-2011; McCallum, Erin/AAJ-4052-2020; Guenat, Heather/H-6528-2014; Brooks, Bryan W/B-2612-2010","Ford, Alex/0000-0001-5202-546X; Ågerstrand, Marlene/0000-0003-2697-2310; McCallum, Erin/0000-0001-5426-9652; Brooks, Bryan W/0000-0002-6277-9852; Balshine, Sigal/0000-0003-3671-0517; Brodin, Tomas/0000-0003-1086-7567; Maack, Gerd/0000-0001-5980-6533",,,,,117,53,60,2,16,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2050-7887,2050-7895,,ENVIRON SCI-PROC IMP,Environ.

The creative use and placement of sensors on both biologging and biotelemetric platforms can greatly expand the amount of information that can be garnered from ecological studies.ResultsSophisticated transmitters and data loggers, which once were built by the biologists that used them, are available off the shelf from many commercial manufacturers. The ability to purchase a wide variety of electronic tags has allowed for a wider adoption of electronic tags across ecology, but has resulted in many biologists utilizing them with little understanding of how they function. The purpose of this review is to provide a reader-friendly description of the many sensors available to monitor the behavior, physiology, and environment of both terrestrial and aquatic animals. Our approach here is firstly to describe the electrical and mechanical principles behind each type of sensor and secondly to present one or two classic examples of how they have been used to provide insights into the biology of species from a diversity of taxa. Behavioral sensors that record the speed, acceleration, tilt angle, and direction of movement of an animal as well as its swimming depth or flight altitude will be described. Additional sensors are mentioned that detect feeding and spawning behavior as well as the proximity to conspecifics, prey, and predators. Physiological sensors will be described that monitor muscular, sensory, brain, gastric activity as well as body temperature, and sound production. Environmental sensors will be described that measure irradiance, dissolved oxygen, and magnetic field intensity. It is our hope that this review serves as springboard for biologists to develop innovative ways to learn more about their subjects using the myriad sensors that are available today, and the exciting new sensors to be developed in the future.","[Whitford, Malachi] San Diego State Univ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Whitford, Malachi] Univ Calif Davis, Ecol Grad Grp, One Shields Dr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Klimley, A.

Mounting evidence suggests that such pollutants can disrupt the behaviour of non-target species. Despite this, few studies have considered how the response of exposed organisms might be mediated by social context. To redress this, we investigated the impacts of two environmentally realistic concentrations of a pervasive antidepressant pollutant, fluoxetine, on foraging behaviour in fish (Gambusia holbrooki), tested individually or in a group. Fluoxetine did not alter behaviour of solitary fish. However, in a group setting, fluoxetine exposure disrupted the frequency of aggressive interactions and food consumption, with observed effects being contingent on both the mean weight of group members and the level of within-group variation in weight. Our results suggest that behavioural tests in social isolation may not accurately predict the environmental risk of chemical pollutants for group-living species and highlight the potential for social context to mediate the effects of psychoactive pollutants in exposed wildlife.","[Martin, Jake M.; Saaristo, Minna; Tan, Hung; Bertram, Michael G.; Nagarajan-Radha, Venkatesh; Dowling, Damian K.; Wong, Bob B.

In parallel, sophisticated tools have been developed to process, visualize and analyse tracking data; however, many of these tools have proliferated in isolation, making it challenging for users to select the most appropriate method for the question in hand. Indeed, within the r software alone, we listed 58 packages created to deal with tracking data or 'tracking packages'. Here, we reviewed and described each tracking package based on a workflow centred around tracking data (i.e. spatio-temporal locations (x, y, t)), broken down into three stages: pre-processing, post-processing and analysis, the latter consisting of data visualization, track description, path reconstruction, behavioural pattern identification, space use characterization, trajectory simulation and others. Supporting documentation is key to render a package accessible for users. Based on a user survey, we reviewed the quality of packages' documentation and identified 11 packages with good or excellent documentation. Links between packages were assessed through a network graph analysis. Although a large group of packages showed some degree of connectivity (either depending on functions or suggesting the use of another tracking package), one third of the packages worked in isolation, reflecting a fragmentation in the r movement-ecology programming community. Finally, we provide recommendations for users when choosing packages, and for developers to maximize the usefulness of their contribution and strengthen the links within the programming community.","[Joo, Rocio; Boone, Matthew E.; Basille, Mathieu] Univ Florida, Ft Lauderdale Res & Educ Ctr, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA; [Clay, Thomas A.; Patrick, Samantha C.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Clusella-Trullas, Susana] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Clusella-Trullas, Susana] Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Invas Biol, Stellenbosch, South Africa",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Liverpool; Stellenbosch University; Stellenbosch University,"Joo, R (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Ft Lauderdale Res & Educ Ctr, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA.",rocio.joo@ufl.edu,"Clay, Tommy/W-4867-2019; Basille, Mathieu/A-6133-2017","Clay, Tommy/0000-0002-0644-6105; Boone, Matthew/0000-0002-8070-4715; Joo, Rocio/0000-0003-0319-4210; Basille, Mathieu/0000-0001-9366-7127; Clusella-Trullas, Susana/0000-0002-8891-3597",Human Frontier Science Program Young Investigator Grant,Human Frontier Science Program Young Investigator Grant(Human Frontier Science Program),Human Frontier Science Program Young Investigator Grant,,138,61,71,10,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Integration of range-wide population trajectories and size estimates indicates a net loss approaching 3 billion birds, or 29% of 1970 abundance.

This loss of bird abundance signals an urgent need to address threats to avert future avifaunal collapse and associated loss of ecosystem integrity, function, and services.","[Rosenberg, Kenneth V.; Dokter, Adriaan M.; Helft, Laura] Cornell Univ, Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Rosenberg, Kenneth V.; Parr, Michael] Amer Bird Conservancy, Washington, DC 20008 USA; [Blancher, Peter J.; Smith, Paul A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada; [Sauer, John R.] US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Laurel, MD 20708 USA; [Smith, Adam C.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada; [Stanton, Jessica C.] US Geol Survey, Upper Midwest Environm Sci Ctr, La Crosse, WI USA; [Panjabi, Arvind] Bird Conservancy Rockies, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA; [Marra, Peter P.] Natl Zool Pk, Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Migratory Bird Ctr, POB 37012,MRC 5503, Washington, DC 20013 USA; [Marra, Peter P.] Georgetown Univ, Dept Biol, 37th & O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Marra, Peter P.] Georgetown Univ, McCourt Sch Publ Policy, 37th & O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Cornell University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute; Georgetown University; Georgetown University,"Rosenberg, KV (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.;Rosenberg, KV (corresponding author), Amer Bird Conservancy, Washington, DC 20008 USA.",kvr2@cornell.edu,"Dokter, Adriaan/AAA-9244-2021; Peek, Michael/D-5991-2016","Peek, Michael/0000-0001-6055-5129; Smith, Adam Clark/0000-0002-2829-4843; Rosenberg, Kenneth/0000-0001-8939-8286; Parr, Michael/0000-0002-0294-2224; Smith, Paul/0000-0001-9573-5218; Panjabi, Arvind/0000-0002-2862-2675; Stanton, Jessica/0000-0002-6225-3703",NSF [ICER 1927743]; AWS Cloud Credits for Research; NSF ABI Innovation [DBI-1661259]; NSF LTREB [DEB1242584],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); AWS Cloud Credits for Research; NSF ABI Innovation; NSF LTREB(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"NSF LTREB DEB1242584 to P.P.M.; AWS Cloud Credits for Research, NSF ABI Innovation DBI-1661259, and NSF ICER 1927743 to A.M.D.",,96,969,1188,39,572,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",0036-8075,1095-9203,,SCIENCE,Science,OCT 4,2019,366,6461,,,SI,,120,+,,10.1126/science.aaw1313,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw1313,,,45,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,JC2ZU,31604313,Bronze,Y,N,2024-03-03,WOS:000489147000068,View Full Record in Web of Science

State-of-the-art deep-learning methods offer major advances in data quality and detail by allowing researchers to automatically estimate locations of an animal's body parts directly from images or videos. However, currently available animal pose estimation methods have limitations in speed and robustness. Here, we introduce a new easy-to-use software toolkit, DeepPoseKit, that addresses these problems using an efficient multi-scale deep-learning model, called Stacked DenseNet, and a fast GPU-based peak-detection algorithm for estimating keypoint locations with subpixel precision. These advances improve processing speed >2x with no loss in accuracy compared to currently available methods. We demonstrate the versatility of our methods with multiple challenging animal pose estimation tasks in laboratory and field settings-including groups of interacting individuals.

These highly mobile ants endure the extreme temperatures of their sand dune environment with outstanding behavioural, physiological and morphological adaptations. Surprisingly, C. bombycina has comparatively shorter legs than its well-studied sister species Cataglyphis fortis from salt pan habitats. This holds despite the somewhat hotter surface temperatures and the more yielding sand substrate. Here, we report that C. bombycina employs a different strategy in reaching high running speeds, outperforming the fastest known runs of the longer-legged C. fortis ants. Video analysis across a broad range of locomotor speeds revealed several differences to C. fortis. Shorter leg lengths are compensated for by high stride frequencies, ranging beyond 40 Hz. This is mainly achieved by a combination of short stance phases (down to 7 ms) and fast leg swing movements (up to 1400 mm s(-1)). The legs of one tripod group exhibit almost perfect synchrony in the timings of their lift-offs and touchdowns, and good tripod coordination is present over the entire walking speed range (tripod coordination strength values around 0.8). This near synchrony in leg movement may facilitate locomotion across the yielding sand dune substrate.","[Pfeffer, Sarah Elisabeth; Wahl, Verena Luisa; Wittlinger, Matthias; Wolf, Harald] Ulm Univ, Inst Neurobiol, Albert Einstein Allee 11, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Wittlinger, Matthias] Univ Freiburg, Inst Biol 1, Hauptstr 1, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany",Ulm University; University of Freiburg,"Pfeffer, SE; Wittlinger, M; Wolf, H (corresponding author), Ulm Univ, Inst Neurobiol, Albert Einstein Allee 11, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.;Wittlinger, M (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Biol 1, Hauptstr 1, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",sarah.pfeffer@alumni.uni-ulm.de; matthias.wittlinger@biologie.uni-freiburg.de; harald.wolf@uni-ulm.de,,"Wolf, Harald/0000-0003-2715-3376; Pfeffer, Sarah/0000-0003-1470-5055; Wahl, Verena Luisa/0000-0002-6416-1829",University of Ulm,University of Ulm,The University of Ulm provided basic financial support and infrastructure.,,43,31,31,3,22,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

For fish, a large proportion of species spend all or part of their lives in groups, with group coordination playing an important role in the emergent benefits of group-living. Group cohesion can be altered by an array of factors, including exposure to toxic environmental contaminants. Oil spills are one of the most serious forms of pollution in aquatic systems, and while a range of effects of acute oil exposure on animal physiology have been demonstrated, sub-lethal effects on animal behavior are relatively under-studied. Here we used an open-field behavioral assay to explore influence of acute oil exposure on social behavior in a gregarious fish native to the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). We used two oil concentrations (0.7% and 2% oil dilution, or 6.0 +/- 0.9 and 32.9 +/- 5.9 mu gl(-1) Sigma PAH(50) respectively) and assays were performed when all members of a group were exposed, when only one member was exposed, and when no individuals were exposed. Shoal cohesion, as assessed via mean neighbor distance, showed significant impairment following acute exposure to 2% oil. Fish in oil-exposed groups also showed reduced voluntary movement speed. Importantly, overall group cohesion was disrupted when even one fish within a shoal was exposed to 2% oil, and the behavior of unexposed in mixed groups, in terms of movement speed and proximity to the arena wall, was affected by the presence of these exposed fish. These results demonstrate that oil exposure can have adverse effects on fish behavior that may lead to reduced ecological success.","[Armstrong, Tiffany; Killen, Shaun S.; Fearnley, Hannah; Parsons, Kevin J.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Khursigara, Alexis J.; Esbaugh, Andrew J.] Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA",University of Glasgow; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Khursigara, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA.",akhursigara@utexas.edu,"Esbaugh, Andrew J/N-4452-2017","Khursigara, Alexis/0000-0003-0139-2694",Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative [SA-1520]; NERC [NE/J019100/1]; European Research Council [640004]; NERC [NE/J019100/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This research was made possible by a grant from The Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative awarded to AJE, Grant No: SA-1520; Name: Relationship of Effects of Cardiac Outcomes in fish for Validation of Ecological Risk (RECOVER).

We tracked the migratory movements of imidacloprid-exposed songbirds at a landscape scale using a combination of experimental dosing and automated radio telemetry. Ingestion of field-realistic quantities of imidacloprid (1.2 or 3.9 milligrams per kilogram body mass) by white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) during migratory stopover caused a rapid reduction in food consumption, mass, and fat and significantly affected their probability of departure. Birds in the high-dose treatment stayed a median of 3.5 days longer at the site of capture after exposure as compared with controls, likely to regain fuel stores or recover from intoxication. Migration delays can carry over to affect survival and reproduction: thus, these results confirm a link between sublethal pesticide exposure and adverse outcomes for migratory bird populations.","[Eng, Margaret L.] Univ Saskatchewan, Toxicol Ctr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B3, Canada; [Stutchbury, Bridget J.

Complementing component- and effect-based monitoring with wide-scope target, suspect, and non-target screening (NTS) based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data is recommended to support environmental impact and risk assessment. This will allow for detection of newly emerging compounds and transformation products, retrospective monitoring efforts, and the identification of possible drivers of toxicity by correlation with effects or modelling of expected effects for future and abatement scenarios. HRMS is becoming increasingly available in many laboratories. Thus, the time is right to establish and harmonize screening methods, train staff, and record HRMS data for samples from regular monitoring events and surveys. This will strongly enhance the value of chemical monitoring data for evaluating complex chemical pollution problems, at limited additional costs.

Nonetheless, little is known regarding how exposure to metal pollution affects animal personalities, as defined by repeatable among individual differences in behavior. We used a large dataset to investigate the relationship between individual blood and feather metal concentrations and three personality traits (exploration behavior, territorial aggressiveness, and aggressiveness during nest defense) in great tits (Parus major), a model species for animal personality research. We previously demonstrated slower exploration behavior at highly polluted study sites, where exposure to lead, cadmium, and arsenic is high. Here, we demonstrate the across-year repeatability of exploration behavior and aggressiveness during nest defense, providing strong evidence for the existence of personalities in our populations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that individuals with high blood lead concentrations and high concentrations of multiple metals in the feathers exhibit slower exploration behavior but no differences in territorial aggressiveness or nest defense relative to less exposed birds. The mechanism underlying the relationship between metal exposure and exploration behavior remains to be determined but could involve neurotoxic effects.

Robotics may offer a promising tool to address this compelling problem, but whether and how invasive species can be negatively affected by robotic stimuli is an open question. Here, we explore the possibility of modulating behavioural and life-history responses of mosquitofish by varying the degree of biomimicry of a robotic predator, whose appearance and locomotion are inspired by natural mosquitofish predators. Our results support the prediction that real-time interactions at varying swimming speeds evoke a more robust antipredator response in mosquitofish than simpler movement patterns by the robot, especially in individuals with better body conditions that are less prone to take risks. Through an information-theoretic analysis of animal-robot interactions, we offer evidence in favour of a causal link between the motion of the robotic predator and a fish antipredator response. Remarkably, we observe that even a brief exposure to the robotic predator of 15 min per week is sufficient to erode energy reserves and compromise the body condition of mosquitofish, opening the door for future endeavours to control mosquitofish in the wild.","[Polverino, Giovanni] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Perth, WA, Australia; [Polverino, Giovanni] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Berlin, Germany; [Karakaya, Mert; Spinello, Chiara; Soman, Vrishin R.; Porfiri, Maurizio] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Porfiri, Maurizio] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA",University of Western Australia; Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering; New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering,"Porfiri, M (corresponding author), NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.;Porfiri, M (corresponding author), NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.",mporfiri@nyu.edu,"Karakaya, Mert/AAF-3915-2020; Porfiri, Maurizio/A-1712-2009; Karakaya, Mert/GOK-2781-2022; Polverino, Giovanni/AAC-2556-2020","Karakaya, Mert/0000-0002-8158-3337; Polverino, Giovanni/0000-0001-9737-7995","National Science Foundation [CMMI-1433670, CMMI-1505832]; Forrest Research Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Forrest Research Foundation,This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant nos.

Assessment of the effect of chemical contaminants on behaviours relating to fitness and trophic interactions for example, requires incorporating predator-prey interactions to create impact assessments. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a controlled substance but is still regularly used as a form of mosquito control. There is little explicit information on the effect of DDT on animal behaviour and the consequent effects upon trophic interactions. This study uses a 3 x 2 factorial design to assess the feeding behaviour of Xenopus laevis toward Culex sp. larvae when supplied with different prey cues. We also assess the behavioural responses of mosquito larvae when supplied with no threat cue and predator threat cues when exposed to 0 mu g/L, 2 mu g/L and 20 mu g/L DDT. There was a significant DDT exposure x prey cue interaction whereby DDT significantly decreased the foraging behaviour of X. laevis towards live prey cues, however there was no effect of DDT on X. laevis response to olfactory prey cues. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane exposure caused mosquito larvae to appear hyperactive regardless of DDT concentration. Mosquito larvae anti-predator response was significantly dampened when exposed to 2 mu g/L DDT, however when exposed to 20 mu g/L the anti-predator responses were not impaired. Our results indicate a complex interplay in trophic interactions under DDT exposure, wherein effects are mediated depending on species and concentration. There are possible implications regarding reduced anti-predator behaviour in the prey species but also reduced foraging capacity in the predator, which could drive changes in ecosystem energy pathways. We demonstrate that in order to quantify effects of pesticides upon trophic interactions it is necessary to consider ecologically relevant behaviours of both predator and prey species.","[South, Josie; Weyl, Olaf L.

However, we still know little about how widespread these constraints are and which are the priorities to solve in the short- and mid-term. We present results from a global survey of camera-trappers working across a diversity of institutions and habitats, and using camera traps for a range of purposes. We show that: (1) the major current constraints on effective camera-trapping are cost, theft and sensor performance (with 66%, 50% and 42% of respondents respectively classifying those as important or extremely important barriers for camera-trapping); (2) the most-needed technological developments are related to sensor performance (faster triggering responses and higher sensitivity), resistance to extreme environmental conditions (extreme temperatures and high humidity) and automated filtering of blank images; and (3) there is considerable variation among camera trap manufacturers in user-rated performance, and none of the manufacturer ratings exhibited a trend over time, despite improvements in the technology. Our results serve as valuable market research for both open-source and commercial camera trap developers. On the basis of our survey of camera-trappers, we foresee a transition towards camera-trapping 3.0 in the near-future, consisting of both more effective camera trap units, but also greater use of wireless data transmission, sensor networks, automation of processes using algorithms and better, more collaborative tools for managing and analysing camera trap data. Ultimately, this will increase the capacity of researchers and conservationists to implement coordinated wildlife monitoring at unprecedented scales.","[Glover-Kapfer, Paul] WWF UK, Living Planet Ctr, Rufford House,Brewery Rd, Woking GU21 4LL, Surrey, England; [Soto-Navarro, Carolina A.] Luc Hoffmann Inst, David Attenborough Bldg,Pembroke St, Cambridge CB2 3QZ, England; [Soto-Navarro, Carolina A.] UNEP WCMC, World Conservat Monitoring Ctr, 219 Huntingdon Rd, Cambridge CB3 0DL, England; [Wearn, Oliver R.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, Regents Pk, London NW1 4RY, England",World Wildlife Fund; United Nations Environment Programme; Zoological Society of London,"Soto-Navarro, CA (corresponding author), UN Environm World Conservat Monitoring Ctr, 219 Huntingdon Rd, Cambridge CB3 0DL, England.",sotonavarrocarolina@gmail.com,,"Soto Navarro, Carolina/0000-0002-9425-9587; Wearn, Oliver/0000-0001-8258-3534",WWF-UK; AXA Research Fellowship,WWF-UK; AXA Research Fellowship(AXA Research Fund),"We warmly thank the following camera trap users for their responses to the survey: Troy A.

Methods: The concept of a systematic evidence map (SEM) is defined and contrasted to the function and limitations of systematic review (SR) in the context of risk management decision-making. The potential for SEMs to facilitate evidence-based decision-making are explored using a hypothetical example in risk management priority-setting. The potential role of SEMs in reference to broader risk management workflows is characterised. Results: SEMs are databases of systematically gathered research which characterise broad features of the evidence base. Although not intended to substitute for the evidence synthesis element of systematic reviews, SEMs provide a comprehensive, queryable summary of a large body of policy relevant research. They provide an evidence-based approach to characterising the extent of available evidence and support forward looking predictions or trendspotting in the chemical risk sciences. In particular, SEMs facilitate the identification of related bodies of decision critical chemical risk information which could be further analysed using SR methods, and highlight gaps in the evidence which could be addressed with additional primary studies to reduce uncertainties in decision-making. Conclusions: SEMs have strong and growing potential as a high value tool in resource efficient use of existing research in chemical risk management. They can be used as a critical precursor to efficient deployment of high quality SR methods for characterising chemical health risks. Furthermore, SEMs have potential, at a large scale, to support the sort of evidence summarisation and surveillance methods which would greatly increase the resource efficiency, transparency and effectiveness of regulatory initiatives such as EU REACH and US TSCA.","[Wolffe, Taylor A.

Objective: To provide a comprehensive analysis of all regulatory compliant aquatic ecotoxicity data and evaluate the current triggers and effects-based environmental assessments to facilitate the development of more efficient approaches for pharmaceuticals toxicity testing. Methods: Publicly-available regulatory compliant ecotoxicity data for drugs targeting human proteins was compiled together with pharmacological information including drug targets, Cmax and lipophilicity. Possible links between these factors and the ecotoxicity data for effects on, growth, mortality and/or reproduction, were evaluated. The environmental risks were then assessed based on a combined analysis of drug toxicity and predicted environmental concentrations based on European patient consumption data. Results: For most (88%) of the of 975 approved small molecule drugs targeting human proteins a complete set of regulatory compliant ecotoxicity data in the public domain was lacking, highlighting the need for both intelligent approaches to prioritize legacy human drugs for a tailored environmental risk assessment and a transparent database that captures environmental data. We show that presence/absence of drug-target orthologues are predictive of susceptible species for the more potent drugs. Drugs that target the endocrine system represent the highest potency and greatest risk. However, for most drugs ( > 80%) with a full set of ecotoxicity data, risk quotients assuming worst-case exposure assessments were below one in all European countries indicating low environmental risks for the endpoints assessed. Conclusion: We believe that the presented analysis can guide improvements to current testing procedures, and provide valuable approaches for prioritising legacy drugs (i.e. those registered before 2006) for further ecotoxicity testing. For drugs where effects of possible concern (e.g. behaviour) are not captured in regulatory tests, additional mechanistic testing may be required to provide the highest confidence for avoiding environmental impacts.","[Gunnarsson, Lina; Verbruggen, Bas; Tyler, Charles R.] Univ Exeter, Biosci, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4QD, Devon, England; [Snapk, Jason R.; Owen, Stewart F.; Hutchinson, Kathryn] AstraZeneca, Global Environm, Alderley Pk, Macclesfield SK10 4TF, Cheshire, England; [Snapk, Jason R.] Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Gibbet Hill Campus, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Kristiansson, Erik; Osterlund, Tobias] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Math Sci, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Kristiansson, Erik; Osterlund, Tobias] Univ Gothenburg, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Margiotta-Casaluci, Luigi] Brunel Univ London, Inst Environm Hlth & Soc, London UB8 3PH, England; [Leverett, Dean; Marks, Becky] WCA, Brunel House,Volunteer Way, Faringdon SN7 7YR, Oxon, England",University of Exeter; AstraZeneca; University of Warwick; Chalmers University of Technology; University of Gothenburg; Brunel University,"Tyler, CR (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Geoffrey Pope Bldg,Stocker Rd, Exeter EX4 4QD, Devon, England.",C.R.Tyler@exeter.ac.ux,"Kristiansson, Erik/JHS-8257-2023; Owen, Stewart/ABF-1216-2021; Margiotta-Casaluci, Luigi/A-5402-2011","Margiotta-Casaluci, Luigi/0000-0001-6938-0396; Owen, Stewart/0000-0003-1398-7142",AstraZeneca Global SHE Research Programme; Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) Joint Undertaking under 'Intelligence-led Assessment of Pharmaceuticals in the Environment' (iPiE) [115735]; EU; European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA); AstraZeneca [102519]; NERC [NE/K004263/1] Funding Source: UKRI,AstraZeneca Global SHE Research Programme; Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) Joint Undertaking under 'Intelligence-led Assessment of Pharmaceuticals in the Environment' (iPiE); EU(European Union (EU)); European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA); AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The work of the authors is supported by the following institutes, organisations and grants: (1) AstraZeneca Global SHE Research Programme grant to C.R.T.; (2) the research leading to these results has received support from the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) Joint Undertaking under 'Intelligence-led Assessment of Pharmaceuticals in the Environment' (iPiE) grant agreement no 115735, resources of which are composed of financial contribution from the EU's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) companies in kind contribution.

In this paper, we review existing implementations and show that deep learning has been used successfully to identify species, classify animal behaviour and estimate biodiversity in large datasets like camera-trap images, audio recordings and videos. We demonstrate that deep learning can be beneficial to most ecological disciplines, including applied contexts, such as management and conservation. We also identify common questions about how and when to use deep learning, such as what are the steps required to create a deep learning network, which tools are available to help, and what are the requirements in terms of data and computer power. We provide guidelines, recommendations and useful resources, including a reference flowchart to help ecologists get started with deep learning. We argue that at a time when automatic monitoring of populations and ecosystems generates a vast amount of data that cannot be effectively processed by humans anymore, deep learning could become a powerful reference tool for ecologists.","[Christin, Sylvain; Lecomte, Nicolas] Univ Moncton, Dept Biol, Canada Res Chair Polar & Boreal Ecol, Moncton, NB, Canada; [Hervet, Eric] Univ Moncton, Dept Comp Sci, Moncton, NB, Canada",University of Moncton; University of Moncton,"Lecomte, N (corresponding author), Univ Moncton, Dept Biol, Canada Res Chair Polar & Boreal Ecol, Moncton, NB, Canada.",nicolas.lecomte@umoncton.ca,"Christin, Sylvain/AAS-8910-2020","Lecomte, Nicolas/0000-0002-8473-5375; Christin, Sylvain/0000-0001-5876-911X",Canada Research Chair in Polar and Boreal Ecology; New Brunswick Innovation Fund; Polar Knowledge Canada,Canada Research Chair in Polar and Boreal Ecology; New Brunswick Innovation Fund; Polar Knowledge Canada,Canada Research Chair in Polar and Boreal Ecology; New Brunswick Innovation Fund; Polar Knowledge Canada,,81,237,260,28,273,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Faced with these new challenges, species with diverse and flexible migratory behaviors may suffer less from population decline, as they may be better at responding to these changes by altering their migratory behavior. At the individual level, variations in migratory behavior may lead to differences in fitness and subsequently influence the population's demographic dynamics. Using lifetime GPS bio-logging data from 169 white storks (Ciconia ciconia), we explore whether the recently shortened migration distance of storks affects their survival during different stages of their juvenile life. We also explore how other variations in migratory decisions (i.e., time, destination), movement activity (measured using overall body dynamic acceleration), and early life conditions influence juvenile survival. We observed that their first autumn migration was the riskiest period for juvenile white storks. Individuals that migrated shorter distances and fledged earlier experienced lower mortality risks. In addition, higher movement activity and overwintering closer-to-home (with 84.21% of the tracked individuals stayed Europe or North Africa) were associated with higher survival. Our study shows how avian migrants can change life history decisions over only a few decades, and thus it helps us to understand and predict how migrants respond to the rapidly changing world.","[Cheng, Yachang; Fiedler, Wolfgang; Wikelski, Martin; Flack, Andrea] Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Migrat, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Cheng, Yachang; Fiedler, Wolfgang; Wikelski, Martin; Flack, Andrea] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Constance, Germany; [Wikelski, Martin; Flack, Andrea] Univ Konstanz, Ctr Adv Study Collect Behav, Constance, Germany",Max Planck Society; University of Konstanz; University of Konstanz,"Cheng, Y; Flack, A (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Migrat, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany.",ycheng@ab.mpg.de; aflack@ab.mpg.de,"Flack, Andrea/E-6247-2016; Fiedler, Wolfgang/AAG-4510-2021; Cheng, Yachang/AAK-3207-2020","Flack, Andrea/0000-0002-9099-2802; Fiedler, Wolfgang/0000-0003-1082-4161; Cheng, Yachang/0000-0002-2108-7227",DFG Centre of Excellence 2117 Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour [422037984]; Chinese Scholarship Council; Max Planck Society; IMPRS for Organismal Biology; German Aerospace Center (DLR); Christiane Nusslein-Volhard Stiftung,DFG Centre of Excellence 2117 Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Chinese Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society); IMPRS for Organismal Biology; German Aerospace Center (DLR)(Helmholtz AssociationGerman Aerospace Centre (DLR)); Christiane Nusslein-Volhard Stiftung,"We sincerely thank all the collaborators, researchers, and volunteers who helped with tagging white storks, confirming death events in the field and retrieving the tags.

To explore how trace levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid impacted colony foraging performance, we equipped bees with RFID tags that allowed us to track their lifetime flight behavior. One group of bees was exposed to a trace concentration (5 mu g/kg, ppb) of imidacloprid in sugar syrup while in the larval stage. The imidacloprid residues caused bees to start foraging when younger as adults and perform fewer orientation flights, and reduced their lifetime foraging flights by 28%. The magnitude of the effects of a trace imidacloprid concentration delivered only during larval stage highlights the severity of pesticide residues for bee foraging performance. Our data suggest that neonicotinoids could impact colony function by imbalancing the normal age based division of labor in a colony and reducing foraging efficiency. Understanding this mechanism will help the development of interventions to safeguard bee colony health.","[Colin, Theotime; Barron, Andrew B.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Meikle, William G.] USDA ARS, Carl Hayden Bee Res Ctr, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Wu, Xiaobo] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Honeybee Res Inst, Nanchang 330029, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Macquarie University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Jiangxi Agricultural University,"Colin, T (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.;Wu, XB (corresponding author), Jiangxi Agr Univ, Honeybee Res Inst, Nanchang 330029, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",theotime.colin@mq.edu.au; wuxiaobo21@163.com,"Colin, Theotime/AAW-7734-2020; Meikle, William/AAC-2481-2022","Barron, Andrew/0000-0002-8135-6628; Meikle, William/0000-0002-1759-6950; Colin, Theotime/0000-0003-0223-4479",Australian Research Council (ARC) [140100452]; United States Department of Agriculture ARS [58-5342-3-004F]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31760714]; iMQRES scholarship from Macquarie University,Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); United States Department of Agriculture ARS(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); iMQRES scholarship from Macquarie University,"We thank Milagra Weiss for her guidance with the imidacloprid dilutions and Jack Westacott and Casey Forster who assisted with the hive evaluations, treatment feeding, and bee tagging.

However, large-scale exposures are still very rare due to prohibitive costs, the availability of replicated habitats, and the potential for exposure to cause lasting damage to the environment. Here, we evaluated the viability of internal slow-release implants as an alternative method for manipulating CEC exposures in aquatic wildlife using two fat-based carriers (coconut oil and vegetable shortening). We treated roach (Rutilus rutilus) with implants containing a high (50 mu g/g), low (25 mu g/g), or control (0 mu g/g) concentration of the behavior-modifying pharmaceutical oxazepam. We then measured oxazepam uptake in four tissues (plasma, muscle, liver, and the brain) over 1 month. The two carriers released oxazepam differently: coconut oil was the superior implant type because it delivered a more consistent dose across time, while vegetable shortening released oxazepam rapidly at the start of the exposure period. For both carriers and treatments, the brain and liver contained the most oxazepam. Overall, the method is a promising technique for controlled manipulations of pharmaceuticals in fish, and we have provided some of the first data on the suitability and contaminant release kinetics from different implant types.","[McCallum, Erin S.] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [McCallum, Erin S.; Brodin, Tomas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Cerveny, Daniel; Fick, Jerker] Umea Univ, Dept Chem, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Cerveny, Daniel] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Fisheries & Protect Waters, South Bohemian Res Ctr Aquaculture & Biodivers Hy, Res Inst Fish Culture & Hydrobiol, Zatisi 728-2, Vodnany 38925, Czech Republic",Umea University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Umea University; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"McCallum, ES (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.;McCallum, ES (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",erin.mccallum@slu.se,"Cerveny, Daniel/ABE-9683-2021; Cerveny, Daniel/R-4557-2016; Berglund Fick, Jerker/HDO-5788-2022; McCallum, Erin/AAJ-4052-2020","Cerveny, Daniel/0000-0003-1491-309X; Cerveny, Daniel/0000-0003-1491-309X; McCallum, Erin/0000-0001-5426-9652; Fick, Jerker/0000-0002-3949-7371; Brodin, Tomas/0000-0003-1086-7567",FORMAS grant [2013-734]; Wenner-Gren Foundation; Kempe Foundation,FORMAS grant(Swedish Research Council Formas); Wenner-Gren Foundation; Kempe Foundation,"We would like to thank R.

The exposure to low insecticide doses is often associated with a fitness decline in affected organisms. We determined the effects of exposure to the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin, at a concentration 20 times lower than the LC50, on the cuticle surface profile containing mating cues, the mating and aggression behaviour and fitness consequences for a beetle species (Phaedon cochleariae Fabricius), which faces agropollutants when occurring close to farmland. Traits were investigated in the insecticide-exposed parental generation, and carry-over effects into their unexposed offspring were studied. In both the parental and the offspring generation, the chemical surface profile was unaffected by the insecticide exposure. Nevertheless, insecticide exposure and carry-over effects decreased male mating acceptance of females in no-choice situations. A reduced acceptance of insecticide-exposed females may be related to changes in specific chemical surface cues, because males attempted to mate more readily with dummies treated with surface extracts of control females than of insecticide-exposed females. Moreover, females became more aggressive in dual-choice situations towards other females in the presence of an insecticide-exposed compared to an unexposed male, potentially due to neuronal dysfunctions. Thus, both intersexual (chemical) communication during mating and intrasexual communication were altered in response to insecticide exposure. Insecticide-exposed parents and their offspring suffered from a decreased reproductive output, likely due to direct toxic effects or constraints induced by detoxification processes. The carry-over effects might be mediated by a parental insecticide transfer or insecticide-induced heritable epigenetic changes involved in detoxification processes. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that sublethal insecticide exposure can have far-reaching consequences on (non-target) herbivores. These results have implications for population dynamics and, ultimately, for ecological communities, as insects are highly important members of food chains. Therefore, long-term effects of short-term insecticide exposure should be considered in the evaluation of pesticides and the discussion about pesticide usage in agriculture.","[Mueller, Thorben; Roemer, Clara Isis; Mueller, Caroline] Bielefeld Univ, Dept Chem Ecol, Bielefeld, Germany",University of Bielefeld,"Müller, C (corresponding author), Bielefeld Univ, Dept Chem Ecol, Bielefeld, Germany.",caroline.mueller@uni-bielefeld.de,"Muller, Caroline/G-5073-2011","Muller, Caroline/0000-0002-8447-534X",,,,,61,20,20,1,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

We present a generalised semi-automated approach where machine learning can map targets of interest in drone imagery, supported by predictive modelling for estimating wildlife aggregation populations. We demonstrated this application on four large spatially complex breeding waterbird colonies on floodplains, ranging from c. 20,000 to c. 250,000 birds, providing estimates of bird nests. Our mapping and modelling approach was applicable to all four colonies, without any modification, effectively dealing with variation in nest size, shape, colour and density and considerable background variation (vegetation, water, sand, soil, etc.). Our semi-automated approach was between three and eight times faster than manually counting nests from imagery at the same level of accuracy. This approach is a significant improvement for monitoring large and complex aggregations of wildlife, offering an innovative solution where ground counts are costly, difficult or not possible. Our framework requires minimal technical ability, is open-source (Google Earth Engine and R), and easy to apply to other surveys.","[Lyons, Mitchell B.; Brandis, Kate J.; Murray, Nicholas J.; Wilshire, John H.; McCann, Justin A.; Kingsford, Richard T.; Callaghan, Corey T.] UNSW Australia, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Lyons, MB (corresponding author), UNSW Australia, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",mitchell.lyons@unsw.edu.au,"Brandis, Kate/P-4071-2019; Murray, Nicholas J/E-4607-2016","Brandis, Kate/0000-0001-6807-0142; Murray, Nicholas J/0000-0002-4008-3053; Kingsford, Richard/0000-0001-6565-4134; Callaghan, Corey/0000-0003-0415-2709",Australian Research Council [LP150100972]; Australian Research Council [LP150100972] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: LP150100972",,38,65,69,3,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis (POLS) expands on this idea and suggests coevolution of these traits with personality and physiology at different levels of biological organization. However, it remains unclear to what extent covariation at different levels aligns and if also behavioral patterns such as diurnal activity changes should be incorporated. Here, we investigate variation in life-history traits as well as behavioral variation at the individual, sex and population level in the Turquoise killifish Nothobranchius furzeri. We performed a common garden laboratory experiment with four populations that differ in pond permanence and scored life-history and behavioral (co-) variation at the individual and population level for both males and females. In addition, we focused on diurnal activity change as a behavioral trait that remains understudied in ecology. Our results demonstrate sex-specific variation in adult body size and diurnal activity change among populations that originate from ponds with differences in permanence. However, there was no pond permanence-dependent divergence in maturation time, juvenile growth rate, fecundity and average activity level. With regard to behavior, individuals differed consistently in locomotor activity and diurnal activity change while, in contrast with POLS predictions, we found no indications for life-history and behavioral covariation at any level. Overall, this study illustrates that diurnal activity change differs consistently between individuals, sexes and populations although this variation does not appear to match POLS predictions.","[Thore, Eli S.

Using replicated temperate pond communities, we evaluate effects of 12 pesticides, nested in four pesticide classes (chloroacetanilides, triazines, carbamates organophosphates) and two pesticide types (herbicides, insecticides) applied at standardised environmental concentrations on larval amphibian exposure and susceptibility to trematode parasites. Most of the variation in exposure and susceptibility occurred at the level of pesticide class and type, not individual compounds. The organophosphate class of insecticides increased snail abundance (first intermediate host) and thus trematode exposure by increasing mortality of snail predators (top-down mechanism). While a similar pattern in snail abundance and trematode exposure was observed with triazine herbicides, this effect was driven by increases in snail resources (periphytic algae, bottom-up mechanism). Additionally, herbicides indirectly increased host susceptibility and trematode infections by (1) increasing time spent in susceptible early developmental stages and (2) suppressing tadpole immunity. Understanding generalisable effects associated with contaminant class and type on transmission is critical in reducing complexities in predicting disease dynamics in at-risk host populations.","[Rumschlag, Samantha L.; Rohr, Jason R.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Eck Inst Global Hlth, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Rumschlag, Samantha L.; Rohr, Jason R.] Univ Notre Dame, Environm Change Initiat, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Rumschlag, Samantha L.; Rohr, Jason R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Halstead, Neal T.] Wildlands Conservat, Tampa, FL USA; [Hoverman, Jason T.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Raffel, Thomas R.] Oakland Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Rochester, MI USA; [Carrick, Hunter J.] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA; [Hudson, Peter J.] Penn State Univ, Huck Inst Life Sci, State Coll, PA USA",University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Oakland University; Central Michigan University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Rumschlag, SL (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Eck Inst Global Hlth, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.;Rumschlag, SL (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Environm Change Initiat, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.;Rumschlag, SL (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",rumschsl@gmail.com,"Hoverman, Jason T/D-1756-2013; Hoverman, Jason/AGR-0056-2022; Raffel, Thomas/JRX-9032-2023; Raffel, Thomas/JRX-8794-2023; Hudson, Peter/AAB-8080-2020; Carrick, Hunter/IUP-4379-2023; Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021","Hoverman, Jason/0000-0002-4002-2728; Hudson, Peter/0000-0003-0468-3403;","National Institutes of Health [R01GM109499, R01TW010286-01]; National Science Foundation [EEID-1518681, EF-1241889, IOS-1754868]; US Department of Agriculture [NRI 2009-35102-0543]",National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"Funding was provided by the National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Number: R01GM109499 and R01TW010286-01; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: EEID-1518681, EF-1241889, and IOS-1754868; US Department of Agriculture, Grant/Award Number: NRI 2009-35102-0543.",,57,25,26,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Automated tracking also improves replicability by avoiding observer bias and allowing reproducible workflows. However, few automated tracking programs exist that are open access, open source and capable of tracking unmarked organisms in noisy environments. Tracktor is an image-based tracking freeware designed to perform single-object tracking in noisy environments, or multi-object tracking in uniform environments while maintaining individual identities. Tracktor is code-based but requires no coding skills other than the user being able to specify tracking parameters in a designated location, much like in a graphical user interface. The installation and use of the software is fully detailed in a user manual. Through four examples of common tracking problems, we show that Tracktor is able to track a variety of animals in diverse conditions. The main strengths of Tracktor lie in its ability to track single individuals under noisy conditions (e.g. when the object shape is distorted), its robustness to perturbations (e.g. changes in lighting conditions during the experiment), and its capacity to track multiple unmarked individuals while maintaining their identities. Additionally, summary statistics and plots allow measuring and visualising common metrics used in the analysis of animal movement (e.g. cumulative distance, speed, acceleration, activity, time spent in specific areas and distance to conspecific, etc.). Tracktor is a versatile, reliable and easy-to-use automated tracking software that is compatible with all operating systems and provides many features not available in other existing freeware.

Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.","[Sanchez-Bayo, Francisco] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney Inst Agr, Eveleigh, NSW 2015, Australia; [Wyckhuys, Kris A.

Moreover, despite the increasing interest for the toxicity of pesticide mixtures how this is influenced by temperature has been largely ignored. We tested whether daily temperature variation (DTV) magnifies the toxicity of two pesticides with a different mode of action, the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and the biopesticide Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti), and of their mixture in the vector mosquito Culex pipiens. Single exposure to CPF and Bti increased mortality and reduced female development time, and exposure to CPF also increased female wing length. DTV was not lethal and did not change the toxicity of the individual pesticides. Yet, a key novel finding was that high DTV increased the mortality of the mixture by changing the interaction between both pesticides from additive to synergistic. Given that in nature daily temperature variation is omnipresent, this is important both for vector control and for ecological risk assessment. The higher toxicity of the mixture at high DTV compared to the typically used constant test temperatures in the laboratory urges caution when evaluating the environmental impact of pesticide mixtures.

The concept of the landscape of fear has recently become central to describing this spatial variation in risk, perception, and response. We present a framework linking the landscape of fear, defined as spatial variation in prey perception of risk, to the underlying physical landscape and predation risk, and to resulting patterns of prey distribution and antipredator behavior. By disambiguating the mechanisms through which prey perceive risk and incorporate fear into decision making, we can better quantify the nonlinear relationship between risk and response and evaluate the relative importance of the landscape of fear across taxa and ecosystems.","[Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.; Middleton, Arthur D.; Brashares, Justin S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall 3114, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Brown, Joel S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, 845 West Taylor St MC 066, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Brown, Joel S.] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Dept Integrated Math Oncol, 12902 Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Power, Mary E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, 3060 Valley Life Sci Bldg 3140, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Gaynor, KM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall 3114, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",kgaynor@berkeley.edu,,"Gaynor, Kaitlyn/0000-0002-5747-0543",NSF GRFP grant,NSF GRFP grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)),"This work was supported by an NSF GRFP grant to K.M.G.

Modern tracking technologies allow unprecedented opportunities to monitor the mortality of individuals for years. However, the methods employed to separate actual deaths from transmitter failures have rarely been validated. Here, we review these previous methods and exploit an intensive satellite-tagging programme on raptorial black kites Milvus migrans to examine through tree models whether any tag-parameter indicators could reliably separate 18 confirmed deaths (recovered corpse) from 32 confirmed cases of radio-failure (tagged individual subsequently observed alive). Classification keys were validated on 21 confirmed deaths or radio-failures from an independent tagging study on two other raptor species. Review of tracking studies on mortality showed that they are exponentially increasing and using a wide variety of indicators (e.g., battery charge, stationary locations, fix frequency/quality, sudden tag disappearance, or common sense), with no preponderance of any. Few studies confirmed enough deaths or radio-failures to validate such methods. For GPS-satellite tags, we found a reliable classification key that correctly classified 100% of the deaths and radio-failures in both the calibration and validation datasets through three simple dichotomous indicators: (a) whether GPS locations were stationary or not; (b) whether background Doppler data confirmed them as stationary or not; and (c) whether GPS-locations' frequency gave indication of transmitter malfunctioning or not (Figure 3). For tags recording Doppler locations alone, we failed to find a reliable classification key and advise future researchers to use Doppler data very cautiously (e.g., by censoring any uncertain terminal events) because misclassification rates are likely to be high. Synthesis and applications. Refining the death surveillance function of satellite and GPS-tags will improve the capability of management practitioners to: (a) uncover under-reported casualties provoked by illegal or conflictual causes (e.g., poisoning, shooting, collision with windmills); and (b) calibrate demographic models which form the basis of management plans (e.g., population viability or sustainable harvest models). Improved exploitation of such remote monitoring will markedly advance the efficiency, planning, and implementation of management projects on imperilled or harvestable species affected by illegal, conflictual, or cryptic sources of mortality.","[Sergio, Fabrizio; Tanferna, Alessandro; Blas, Julio] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville, Spain; [Blanco, Guillermo; Hiraldo, Fernando] CSIC, Museum Nat Sci, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Madrid, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Biologica de Donana (EBD); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC),"Sergio, F (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville, Spain.",fsergio@ebd.csic.es,"Tanferna, Alessandro/L-6648-2015; Blanco, Guillermo/L-3170-2014; Hiraldo, Fernando/AAA-8314-2019; Sergio, Fabrizio/B-3952-2015; Blas, Julio/A-2487-2012","Tanferna, Alessandro/0000-0003-0799-301X; Blanco, Guillermo/0000-0001-5742-4929; Sergio, Fabrizio/0000-0002-8024-1773; Blas, Julio/0000-0003-0589-3322","Natural Research Ltd; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation/Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2008-01781, CGL2011-28103, CGL2012-32544, CGL2015-69445-P]; Junta de Andalucia [RNM 3822, RNM 7307]",Natural Research Ltd; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation/Economy and Competitiveness; Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia),"Natural Research Ltd; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation/Economy and Competitiveness, Grant/Award Number: CGL2008-01781, CGL2011-28103, CGL2012-32544 and CGL2015-69445-P; Junta de Andalucia, Grant/Award Number: RNM 3822 and RNM 7307",,46,35,36,17,71,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Although a widespread behavior, few investigators have studied the nocturnal roosting behavior of birds. Studies conducted to date have either focused on species that roost communally or used radio-telemetry to locate sleeping individuals of a few focal species. Portable thermal cameras capable of detecting infrared (IR) heat signals may provide a more efficient and less invasive means of detecting nocturnal-roosting endotherms such as birds. Our objective was to assess the efficacy of using thermal cameras to detect roosting birds in a woodland bird community in southeastern Australia. To better understand the limitations of using thermography to detect roosting birds, paired bird surveys were conducted along 44 transects from May to September 2016 using both traditional survey techniques during the day and surveys with a thermal camera at night. We detected 195 birds representing 21 species at nocturnal roosts using IR thermography, with the detection rate of birds during nocturnal surveys approximately one-third (29.1%) that during diurnal surveys. Detection rates during nocturnal surveys declined more steeply with distance from observers than for diurnal surveys. Detection rates were significantly higher during diurnal surveys for 14 species of woodland birds, but did not differ between diurnal and nocturnal surveys for eight other species. Roost height, roost visibility, bird mass, and cluster size (i.e., two or more birds in physical contact) did not differ between species categorized as having high or low detectability during nocturnal surveys. Variability among species in nocturnal-detectability could not be attributed to roost-site visibility, roost height, or bird size. Positive detection biases associated with diurnal behavior, such as movement and vocalizations, and limitations of current IR technology, e.g., low resolution, likely contributed to overall lower detection rates during nocturnal surveys. However, our results suggest that infrared thermography can be an effective and useful technique for detecting roosting birds and studying roosting behavior, as well as for population monitoring under certain conditions.","[Mitchell, William F.; Clarke, Rohan H.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Mitchell, WF (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",William.Mitchell@monash.edu,,"Mitchell, William/0000-0003-2212-2562","Parks Victoria [10007916]; Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning","Parks Victoria; Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning","The research was conducted with the support of the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning and Parks Victoria (Permit 10007916) and operated under Animal Ethics Approval (BSCI2016_7).

The European Collaborative Project SOLUTIONS suggests that this likelihood can be estimated with effect-based methods (EBMs) complemented by chemical screening and/or impact modeling. These methods should be used to identify the causes of impacted water quality and to develop programs of measures to improve water quality. Along this line of reasoning, effect-based methods are recommended for Water Framework Directive (WFD) monitoring to cover the major modes of action in the universe of environmentally relevant chemicals so as to evaluate improvements of water quality upon implementing the measures. To this end, a minimum battery of bioassays has been recommended including short-term toxicity to algae, Daphnia and fish embryos complemented with in vitro and short-term in vivo tests on mode-of-action specific effects as proxies for long-term toxicity. The likelihood of adverse impacts can be established with effect-based trigger values, which differentiate good from poor water quality in close alignment with Environmental Quality Standards for individual chemicals, while taking into account mixture toxicity. The use of EBMs is suggested in the WFD as one avenue to establish the likelihood of adverse effects due to chemical pollution in European water systems. The present paper has been written as one component of a series of policy briefs to support decisions on water quality monitoring and management under the WFD.","[Brack, Werner; Escher, Beate I.; Mueller, Christin; Altenburger, Rolf] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Brack, Werner; Hollert, Henner; Seiler, Thomas-Benjamin; Altenburger, Rolf] ABBt Aachen Biol, Inst Environm Res, Dept Ecosyst Anal, Aachen, Germany; [Ait Aissa, Selim; Dulio, Valeria] SEBIO, Inst Natl Environm Ind & Rrisques INERIS, UMR I 02, F-60550 Verneuil En Halatte, France; [Backhaus, Thomas] Univ Gothenburg, Carl Skottsbergs Gata 22B, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Escher, Beate I.] Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Ctr Appl Geosci, Environm Toxicol, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Faust, Michael] Faust & Backhaus Environm Consulting, Fahrenheitstr 1, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Hilscherova, Klara] Masaryk Univ, Res Ctr Tox Cpds Environm RECETOX, Fac Sci, Kamenice 753-5, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Hollender, Juliane] Eawag, Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Munthe, John] IVL Swedish Environm Res Inst, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Posthuma, Leo] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm RIVM, Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Posthuma, Leo] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Environm Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Slobodnik, Jaroslav] Environm Inst, Okruzna 784-42, Kos 97241, Slovakia; [Teodorovic, Ivana] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 2, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Tindall, Andrew J.] WatchFrog, Batiment Genavenir 3,1 Rue Pierre Fontaine, F-91000 Evry, France; [Umbuzeiro, Gisela de Aragao] Univ Estadual Campinas, UNICAMP, Sch Technol, Lab Ecotoxicol & Genotox, BR-13484332 Limeira, SP, Brazil; [Zhang, Xiaowei] Nanjing Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Universite Le Havre Normandie; Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne; University of Gothenburg; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Masaryk University Brno; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute; Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment; Radboud University Nijmegen; Environmental Institute; University of Novi Sad; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Nanjing University,"Brack, W (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",werner.brack@ufz.de,"Posthuma, Leo/G-9441-2015; Hollert, Henner/A-1027-2009; Hilscherova, Klara/B-4595-2011; Seiler, Thomas-Benjamin/K-6294-2012; DULIO, Valeria/S-8401-2018; AIT-AISSA, Selim/Q-8702-2018; Umbuzeiro, Gisela de Aragao/AAX-1923-2021; Escher, Beate I/C-7992-2009; Munthe, John/AEX-9259-2022; Tindall, Andrew/O-2947-2016; Slobodnik, Jaroslav/AAA-9721-2021; Hollender, Juliane/A-2145-2014","Posthuma, Leo/0000-0003-0399-5499; Hollert, Henner/0000-0001-5776-5619; Seiler, Thomas-Benjamin/0000-0001-8127-510X; AIT-AISSA, Selim/0000-0001-7817-1932; Umbuzeiro, Gisela de Aragao/0000-0002-8623-5200; Tindall, Andrew/0000-0001-8119-0923; Slobodnik, Jaroslav/0000-0003-2622-6318; Hollender, Juliane/0000-0002-4660-274X; Munthe, John/0000-0001-6118-5561; Brack, Werner/0000-0001-9269-6524; Altenburger, Rolf/0000-0003-2929-2978; Teodorovic, Ivana/0000-0001-8235-6171","SOLUTIONS project (European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration) [603437]; FAPESP Projects [2013/16956-6, 2015/24758-5]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [13/16956-6] Funding Source: FAPESP","SOLUTIONS project (European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration)(European Union (EU)Marie Curie Actions); FAPESP Projects(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacao do Estado de Santa Catarina (FAPESC))","This article has been prepared as an outcome of the SOLUTIONS project (European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant Agreement No. 603437).

As organismal traits are often correlated, responses to stressors are expected to induce coordinated changes in many traits. A promising framework to study this is the pace of life syndrome (POLS), which predicts the integration of life history, behavioral, and physiological traits along a fast-slow continuum. Using an integrative multi-trait approach, we evaluated the presence of a POLS both within and across latitudes and how POLS patterns are affected by warming and metal pollution. We studied this in Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae of replicated low- and high-latitude populations that strongly differ in voltinism (three to four generations per year vs. one generation every two years) reared in a common-garden experiment at two temperatures. Across latitudes, life history, behavior, and physiology covaried in accordance with the POLS, with the fast-paced low-latitude damselflies characterized by a fast growth rate, high activity, and more explorative and risk-taking behavior, fast metabolic rate, and low investment in immune function (activity of phenoloxidase). This fast POLS strategy was associated with a higher sensitivity to metal exposure and a higher vulnerability to predation. Warming caused opposite responses between the latitudes consistent with differential thermal adaptation in growth rate, behavior, and oxidative stress parameters. Despite this, damselflies of both latitudes showed a consistent pattern in phenotypic correlations among traits that, moreover, was not affected by warming and metal exposure. Within latitudes, there was no full support for the POLS. More active larvae were more explorative and risk taking, which aligned with the fast-slow life history axis, but less strong than at the across-latitude level. Physiological traits were also integrated within latitudes, yet there was no unambiguous coupling with the fast-slow life history continuum. The consistent syndrome structure, if underpinned by genetic correlations, may restrict the independent evolution of individual traits, yet may not necessarily constrain adaptive evolution of integrated trait sets. This is because the covariance pattern was to a large extent similar across latitudes and within latitudes, suggesting adaptive trait integration guiding adaptive evolution of trait sets along the fast-slow continuum.","[Debecker, Sara; Stoks, Robby] Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, Evolutionary Stress Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Charles Deberiotstr 32, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Stoks, R (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, Evolutionary Stress Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Charles Deberiotstr 32, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",robby.stoks@kuleuven.be,"Debecker, Sara/HJB-2368-2022; Stoks, Robby/AAK-1227-2020","Debecker, Sara/0000-0002-6097-5307; Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459","Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO); FWO [G.0704.13, G.0524.17]; KU Leuven [C16/17/002]",Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO)(FWO); FWO(FWO); KU Leuven(KU Leuven),"We thank Philippe Lambret and Viktor Nilsson-Ortman for collecting the damselfly eggs.

One MPG of particular concern is 17 beta-trenbolone, which is persistent in freshwater habitats and can affect the development, morphology and reproductive behaviors of aquatic organisms. Despite this, few studies have investigated impacts of 17 beta-trenbolone on non-reproductive behaviors linked to growth and survival, like boldness and predator avoidance. None consider the interaction between 17 beta-trenbolone and other environmental stressors, such as temperature, although environmental challenges confronting animals in the wild seldom, if ever, occur in isolation. Accordingly, this study aimed to test the interactive effects of trenbolone and temperature on organismal behavior. To do this, eastern mosquitofish (Gambusio holbrooki) were subjected to an environmentally-relevant concentration of 17 beta-trenbolone (average measured concentration 3.0 +/- 0.2 ng/L) or freshwater (i.e. control) for 21 days under one of two temperatures (20 and 30 degrees C), after which the predator escape, boldness and exploration behavior of fish were tested. Predator escape behavior was assayed by subjecting fish to a simulated predator strike, while boldness and exploration were assessed in a separate maze experiment. We found that trenbolone exposure increased boldness behavior. Interestingly, some behavioral effects of trenbolone depended on temperature, sex, or both. Specifically, significant effects of trenbolone on male predator escape behavior were only noted at 30 degrees C, with males becoming less reactive to the simulated threat. Further, in the maze experiment, trenbolone-exposed fish explored the maze faster than control fish, but only at 20 degrees C. We conclude that field detected concentrations of 17 beta-trenbolone can impact ecologically important behaviors of fish, and such effects can be temperature dependent. Such findings underscore the importance of considering the potentially interactive effects of other environmental stressors when investigating behavioral effects of environmental contaminants.

In particular, the recent boom in passive acoustic sensors has provided efficient, noninvasive, and taxonomically broad means to study wildlife populations and communities, and monitor their responses to environmental change. However, until recently, technological costs and constraints have largely confined research in passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) to a handful of taxonomic groups (e.g., bats, cetaceans, birds), often in relatively small-scale, proof-of-concept studies. The arrival of low-cost, open-source sensors is now rapidly expanding access to PAM technologies, making it vital to evaluate where these tools can contribute to broader efforts in ecology and biodiversity research. Here, we synthesise and critically assess the current emerging opportunities and challenges for PAM for ecological assessment and monitoring of both species populations and communities. We show that terrestrial and marine PAM applications are advancing rapidly, facilitated by emerging sensor hardware, the application of machine learning innovations to automated wildlife call identification, and work towards developing acoustic biodiversity indicators. However, the broader scope of PAM research remains constrained by limited availability of reference sound libraries and open-source audio processing tools, especially for the tropics, and lack of clarity around the accuracy, transferability and limitations of many analytical methods. In order to improve possibilities for PAM globally, we emphasise the need for collaborative work to develop standardised survey and analysis protocols, publicly archived sound libraries, multiyear audio datasets, and a more robust theoretical and analytical framework for monitoring vocalising animal communities.","[Gibb, Rory; Browning, Ella; Jones, Kate E.] UCL, Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, Ctr Biodivers & Environm Res, London, England; [Browning, Ella; Jones, Kate E.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England; [Glover-Kapfer, Paul] Living Planet Ctr, WWF UK, Woking, Surrey, England; [Glover-Kapfer, Paul] Flora & Fauna Int, David Attenborough Bldg, Cambridge, England",University of London; University College London; Zoological Society of London; World Wildlife Fund,"Jones, KE (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, Ctr Biodivers & Environm Res, London, England.;Jones, KE (corresponding author), Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England.",kate.e.jones@ucl.ac.uk,"Jones, Kate/Y-3317-2019","Jones, Kate/0000-0001-5231-3293",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K503745/1]; World Wildlife Fund; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/P016677/1]; NERC [NE/P016677/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K503745/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); World Wildlife Fund; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Grant/Award Number: EP/K503745/1; World Wildlife Fund; Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/P016677/1",,108,275,308,48,298,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Among these pharmaceuticals, antihistamines are commonly found, and these substances have the potential to influence the physiology of aquatic invertebrates. Previous studies have focused on how antihistamines may affect behaviours of aquatic invertebrates, but these studies probably do not capture the full consequences of antihistamine exposure, as traditional recording techniques do not capture important animal movements occurring at the scale of milliseconds, such as prey escape responses. In this study, we investigated if antihistamine exposure can impact escape responses in aquatic insect, by exposing damselfly (Coenagrion hastulatum) larvae to two environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1 and 1 mu g L-1) of diphenhydramine. Importantly, we used a highspeed imaging approach that with high-time resolution captures details of escape responses and, thus, potential impacts of diphenhydramine on these behaviours. Our results show overall weak effects of antihistamine exposure on the escape behaviours of damselfly larvae. However, at stage 2 of the C-escape response, we found a significant increase in turning angle, which corresponds to a reduced swimming velocity, indicating a reduced success at evading a predator attack. Thus, we show that low concentrations of an antihistamine may affect behaviours strongly related to fitness of aquatic insect prey - effects that would have been overlooked using traditional recording techniques. Hence, to understand the full consequences of pharmaceutical contamination on aquatic wildlife, high-speed imaging should be incorporated into future environmental risk assessments.

In this article, we develop a framework for understanding the mechanisms and multigenerational consequences of TGP. First, we conceptualize the mechanisms of TGP in the context of communication between parents (senders) and offspring (receivers) by dissecting the steps between an environmental cue received by a parent and its resulting effects on the phenotype of one or more future generations. Breaking down the problem in this way highlights the diversity of mechanisms likely to be involved in the process. Second, we review the literature on multigenerational effects and find that the documented patterns across generations are diverse. We categorize different multigenerational patterns and explore the proximate and ultimate mechanisms that can generate them.

To quantify its application and guide future studies, we conducted a systematic review of terrestrial PAM, covering 460 articles published in 122 journals (1992-2018). During this period, PAM-related studies showed above a fifteenfold rise in publication and covered three developing phases: establishment, expansion, and consolidation. Overall, the research was mostly focused on bats (50%), occurred in northern temperate regions (65%), addressed activity patterns (25%), recorded at night (37%), used nonprogrammable recorders (61%), and performed manual acoustic analysis (58%), although their applications continue to diversify. The future agenda should include addressing the development of standardized procedures, automated analysis, and global initiatives to expand PAM to multiple taxa and regions.","[Moreira Sugai, Larissa Sayuri; Ribeiro, Jose Wagner, Jr.] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biociencias, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Moreira Sugai, Larissa Sayuri; Freire Silva, Thiago Sanna] Univ Estadual Paulista, Ecosyst Dynam Observ, Inst Geociencias & Ciencias Exatas, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Llusia, Diego] Univ Fed Goias, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Lab Herpetol & Comportamento Anim, Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Moreira Sugai, Larissa Sayuri; Llusia, Diego] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, Terr Ecol Grp, Madrid, Spain",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade Federal de Goias; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Sugai, LSM (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biociencias, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;Sugai, LSM (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Ecosyst Dynam Observ, Inst Geociencias & Ciencias Exatas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;Sugai, LSM (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, Terr Ecol Grp, Madrid, Spain.",lariagus@gmail.com,"Ribeiro, José Wagner/B-8439-2012; Sugai, Larissa Sayuri/AAV-2626-2021; Silva, Thiago Sanna Freire/A-2444-2009; Llusia, Diego/AAB-2576-2020","Ribeiro, José Wagner/0000-0003-3438-6936; Sugai, Larissa Sayuri/0000-0002-6248-291X; Silva, Thiago Sanna Freire/0000-0001-8174-0489; Llusia, Diego/0000-0001-5432-2716","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [2015/25316-6, 2017/15772-0]; The Rufford Foundation; National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq) [310144/2015-9]; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP); European Commission [H2020, EAVESTROP-661408]; Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad [CGL2017-88764-R]; Comunidad de Madrid (CAM, Spain) [2016-T2/AMB-1722]; [2014/07113-8]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [14/07113-8] Funding Source: FAPESP","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); The Rufford Foundation; National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Comunidad de Madrid (CAM, Spain)(Comunidad de Madrid); ; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacao do Estado de Santa Catarina (FAPESC))","We thank the two anonymous reviewers and Raul Costa Pereira for comments on the manuscript.

This paper provided an innovative approach to detecting deer crossing at highways using 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology. The developed LiDAR data processing procedure includes background filtering, object clustering, and object classification. An automatic background filtering method based on the point distribution was applied to exclude background but keep the deer (and road users if they exist) in the space. A modified density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm was used for object clustering. Adaptive searching parameters were applied in the vertical and horizontal directions to cluster the points. The cluster groups were further classified into three groups-deer, pedestrians, and vehicles, using three different algorithms: naive Bayes, random forest, and k-nearest neighbor. The testing results showed that the random forest (RF) can provide the highest accuracy for classification among the three algorithms. The results of the field test showed that the developed method can detect the deer with an average distance of 30 m far away from the LiDAR. The time delay is about 0.2 s in this test. The deer crossing information can warn drivers about the risks of deer-vehicle crashes in real time.","[Chen, Jingrong] Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Math & Phys, Lanzhou 730070, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hao; Wu, Jianqing; Yue, Rui; Wang, Lu] Univ Nevada, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Yuan, Changwei] Changan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710064, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Lanzhou Jiaotong University; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Chang'an University,"Wu, JQ (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Reno, NV 89557 USA.;Yuan, CW (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710064, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",jianqingw@nevada.unr.edu; yuanchangwei@126.com,"xu, haodong/IAM-9132-2023; Xu, Hao Ran/JED-9378-2023; xu, hao/GWQ-7394-2022",,"Natural Science Foundation of China [61463026, 61463027]; Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) [P224-14-803/TO #13]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [300102238614]; Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Project [18YJAZH120]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Project,"This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61463026 and Grant 61463027, in part by the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) under Grant P224-14-803/TO #13, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 300102238614, and in part by The Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Project under Grant 18YJAZH120.",,47,26,29,1,27,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,65944,65954,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2916718,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2916718,,,11,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,IC9SZ,,gold,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000471325600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We conducted two laboratory experiments to quantify whether predator-prey interactions between California killifish, Fundulus parvipinnis, and the polychaete Polydora cornuta vary with flow speed and chlorpyrifos exposure. In one experiment, only F. parvipinnis was exposed to chlorpyrifos; in the other, only P. cornuta was exposed. The flume included a 300-cm(2) area of sediment with 24P. cornuta in a central patch (98cm(2)). We videotaped groups of three killifish for 50min at one of four flow speeds (6, 9, 12, or 15cm/s) and recorded the proportion of bites directed at the prey patch. Unexposed killifish directed 70% of their bites at the prey patch at 6cm/s, and prey-patch selection decreased as flow increased. Killifish exposed to chlorpyrifos directed 41% of their bites at the prey patch at 6cm/s with reduced prey-patch selection relative to unexposed fish at 9 and 12cm/s. At 15cm/s, both exposed and unexposed fish displayed non-selective biting. Worms were videotaped to quantify their deposit- and suspension-feeding activities. Exposing worms to chlorpyrifos reduced total feeding activity by similar to 30%. Suspension feeding was more common at faster flow speeds, but the time worms spent suspension feeding relative to deposit feeding was unaffected by chlorpyrifos. No behavioral changes were noted in either species when the other was exposed to chlorpyrifos. This study highlights how hydrodynamic conditions can alter the relative importance of a toxicant's effects on predator-prey interactions.","[Hayman, Nicholas T.; Hentschel, Brian T.; Renick, Violet C.; Anderson, Todd W.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Hayman, Nicholas T.; Hentschel, Brian T.; Renick, Violet C.; Anderson, Todd W.] San Diego State Univ, Coastal & Marine Inst, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; California State University System; San Diego State University,"Hayman, NT (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.;Hayman, NT (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Coastal & Marine Inst, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",nicholas.hayman@spawar.navy.mil,,,"Faculty California State University; Council on Ocean Affairs, Science, and Technology (COAST) grant [COAST-GDP-2013-004]; COAST Student Research Award [CSUCOAST-HAYNIC-SDSU-AY1314]; National Science Foundation [NSF-OCE-0000951]","Faculty California State University; Council on Ocean Affairs, Science, and Technology (COAST) grant; COAST Student Research Award; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank all the undergraduate assistants whose help made this project possible: J.

LEAP offers fast prediction on new data, and training with as few as 100 frames results in 95% of peak performance. We validated LEAP using videos of freely behaving fruit flies and tracked 32 distinct points to describe the pose of the head, body, wings and legs, with an error rate of < 3% of body length. We recapitulated reported findings on insect gait dynamics and demonstrated LEAP's applicability for unsupervised behavioral classification.

Due to the associated risks to the mother and baby, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) is often the first line of treatment. Given that FLX readily crosses the placenta, a fetus may be susceptible to the disruptive effects of FLX during this highly plastic stage of development. Here, we demonstrate that a 6-day FLX exposure to a fetus-relevant concentration at a critical developmental stage suppresses cortisol levels in the adult zebrafish (F-0). This effect persists for three consecutive generations in the unexposed descendants (F-1 to F-3) without diminution and is more pronounced in males. We also show that the in vivo cortisol response of the interrenal (fish adrenal) to an i.p. injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone was also reduced in the males from the F-0 and F-3 FLX lineages. Transcriptomic profiling of the whole kidney containing the interrenal cells revealed that early FLX exposure significantly modified numerous pathways closely associated with cortisol synthesis in the male adults from the F-0 and F-3 generations. We also show that the low cortisol levels are linked to significantly reduced exploratory behaviors in adult males from the F-0 to F-2 FLX lineages. This may be a cause for concern given the high prescription rates of FLX to pregnant women and the potential long-term negative impacts on humans exposed to these therapeutic drugs.","[Vera-Chang, Marilyn N.; Moon, Thomas W.; Trudeau, Vance L.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Vera-Chang, Marilyn N.; Moon, Thomas W.; Trudeau, Vance L.] Univ Ottawa, Ctr Adv Res Environm Genom, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [St-Jacques, Antony D.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Chem & Biomol Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [St-Jacques, Antony D.] Univ Ottawa, Ctr Catalysis Res & Innovat, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Gagne, Remi; Yauk, Carole L.] Hlth Canada, Environm Hlth Sci & Res Bur, Ottawa, ON K1A 0K9, Canada; [Martyniuk, Chris J.] Univ Florida, Ctr Environm & Human Toxicol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Martyniuk, Chris J.] Univ Florida, Dept Physiol Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Martyniuk, Chris J.] Univ Florida, Genet Inst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; Health Canada; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Trudeau, VL (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.;Trudeau, VL (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Ctr Adv Res Environm Genom, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",trudeauv@uottawa.ca,"Trudeau, Vance L./P-5542-2019","Trudeau, Vance L./0000-0002-0845-9444; Yauk, Carole/0000-0002-6725-3454; Martyniuk, Christopher J./0000-0003-0921-4796; St-Jacques, Antony/0000-0002-6194-6890; Vera-Chang, Marilyn/0000-0002-5234-9971",Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Nature et Technologie Scholarship; North American Society of Comparative Endocrinology Research Travel Fund; Health Canada; NSERC; University of Ottawa; University Research Chair Program,Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Nature et Technologie Scholarship; North American Society of Comparative Endocrinology Research Travel Fund; Health Canada; NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); University of Ottawa; University Research Chair Program,"We thank Dr. Howard Rundle for his advice on designing the transgenerational breeding experiments, and David Hoang and Devina Patel for laboratory work.

Here, we investigate imidacloprid's effects on bumblebee worker behavior within the nest, using an automated, robotic platform for continuous, multicolony monitoring of uniquely identified workers. We find that exposure to field-realistic levels of imidacloprid impairs nursing and alters social and spatial dynamics within nests, but that these effects vary substantially with time of day. In the field, imidacloprid impairs colony thermoregulation, including the construction of an insulating wax canopy. Our results show that neonicotinoids induce widespread disruption of within-nest worker behavior that may contribute to impaired growth, highlighting the potential of automated techniques for characterizing the multifaceted, dynamic impacts of stressors on behavior in bee colonies.","[Crall, James D.; Brown, Andrea; Pierce, Naomi E.; de Bivort, Benjamin L.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Crall, James D.] Harvard Univ, Planetary Hlth Alliance, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Crall, James D.; de Bivort, Benjamin L.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Switzer, Callin M.] Univ Washington, eSci Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Switzer, Callin M.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Oppenheimer, Robert L.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Biol Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Versypt, Ashlee N.

Although direct toxicity may be partly responsible, contaminants are often present at sub-lethal concentrations in the wild. Behavioural end-points are becoming an increasingly useful method to estimate the impact of contaminants, particularly if the behavioural responses manifest to affect individual fitness (i.e. survival, growth, or reproduction). In the wild, most animals are affected by multiple stressors, and determining how these interact to affect behaviour is critical for understanding the ecological implications of contaminant exposure. Here, we examined the individual and interactive effect of the heavy metal copper and the insecticide imidacloprid on mortality rates and anti-predator behaviours of spotted marsh frog (Limnodynastes tasmaniensis) tadpoles. This common species frequently occupies and breeds in contaminated stormwater and agricultural wetlands, where copper and imidacloprid are often present. These contaminants may alter behaviour via physiological and neurological pathways, as well as affecting how tadpoles respond to chemical cues. Tadpoles suffered unexpectedly high mortality rates when exposed to imidacloprid concentrations well below published LC50 concentrations. Only unexposed tadpoles significantly avoided predator cues. Copper and imidacloprid reduced swimming speed and distance, and escape responses, while increasing erratic swimming. We observed an interactive effect of imidacloprid and copper on erratic swimming, but in general imidacloprid and copper did not act synergistically. Our results suggest that as contaminants enter waterbodies, tadpoles will suffer considerable direct mortality, reduced foraging capacity, and increased susceptibility to predation. Our results provide the first evidence of imidacloprid affecting amphibian behaviour, and highlight both the adverse effects of copper and imidacloprid, and the importance of exploring the effect of multiple contaminants simultaneously.","[Sievers, Michael; Hale, Robin; Swearer, Stephen E.] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Sievers, Michael; Parris, Kirsten M.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Sievers, M (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",sieversm@unimelb.edu.au,"Parris, Kirsten/K-7684-2012; Swearer, Stephen/X-4882-2018; SWEARER, STEPHEN/AAC-1527-2020; Sievers, Michael/ABA-5513-2020","Parris, Kirsten/0000-0003-2550-585X; Swearer, Stephen/0000-0001-6381-9943; SWEARER, STEPHEN/0000-0001-6381-9943; Sievers, Michael/0000-0001-7162-1830",Australian Research Council [LP140100343]; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Melbourne Water; Nature Conservancy; Clean Air and Urban Landscapes Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program; Australian Research Council [LP140100343] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Melbourne Water; Nature Conservancy; Clean Air and Urban Landscapes Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank T.

Here, we connect behavioural assays with survival trials and a modelling approach to quantify changes in antipredator escape performance of a larval freshwater fish following exposure to an environmental oestrogen, and predict changes in population abundance. We quantified the effects of short-term (21 days) exposure to 17 beta-oestradiol (E2) on the antipredator escape performance of larval fathead minnows (Pinrephales promelas) and the probability of predation by a natural predator, the bluegill sunfish (Leponris niacrochirus). Compared with unexposed minnows, minnows exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of E2 that approach total oestrogenic activity of wastewater-dominated environments (38 and 103 ng 1(-1)) had delayed response times and slower escape speeds, and were more susceptible to predation. Incorporating these data into a stage-structured population model demonstrated that enhanced predation mortality at the larval stage can result in population declines. These results indicate that subtle, sub-lethal shifts in the behaviour of individuals due to human-mediated environmental change can impact species interactions with measurable population-level effects. Such changes have the potential to alter higher-order trophic interactions and disrupt aquatic communities.","[Rearick, Daniel C.; Schoenfuss, Heiko] St Cloud State Univ, Dept Biol, St Cloud, MN 56301 USA; [Ward, Jessica; Venturelli, Paul] Ball State Univ, Dept Biol, Muncie, IN 47306 USA",Minnesota State Colleges & Universities; Saint Cloud State University; Ball State University,"Ward, J (corresponding author), Ball State Univ, Dept Biol, Muncie, IN 47306 USA.",jlward4@bsu.edu,"Venturelli, Paul A/A-2337-2008","Venturelli, Paul A/0000-0002-7329-7517",Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund,Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund,"Funding for the present study was provided by the Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund as recommended by the Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources (Grant M.L. 2010, Chp. 362, Sec. 2, Subd. 5).",,81,19,20,1,15,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",2054-5703,,,ROY SOC OPEN SCI,R.

Indeed, recent work explicitly performed under environmentally realistic conditions reveals that chemical contaminants can have both direct and indirect effects at multiple levels of organization by influencing animal behaviour. Altered behaviour reflects multiple physiological changes and links individual-to population-level processes, thereby representing a sensitive tool for holistically assessing impacts of environmentally relevant contaminant concentrations. Here, we show that even if direct effects of contaminants on behavioural responses are reasonably well documented, there are significant knowledge gaps in understanding both the plasticity (i.e. individual variation) and evolution of contaminant-induced behavioural changes. We explore implications of multi-level processes by developing a conceptual framework that integrates direct and indirect effects on behaviour under environmentally realistic contexts. Our framework illustrates how sublethal behavioural effects of contaminants can be both negative and positive, varying dynamically within the same individuals and populations. This is because linkages within communities will act indirectly to alter and even magnify contaminant-induced effects. Given the increasing pressure on wildlife and ecosystems from chemical pollution, we argue there is a need to incorporate existing knowledge in ecology and evolution to improve ecological hazard and risk assessments.","[Saaristo, Minna; Bertram, Michael G.; Wong, Bob B.

It was discovered that bees can solve a task that is generally viewed as spatial concept learning in primates, specifically the concept of above and below. In these works, two pairs of visual stimuli were shown in the two arms of a Y-maze. Each arm displayed a referent shape (e.g., a cross, or a horizontal line) and a second geometric shape that appeared either above or below the referent. Bees learning the concept of aboveness had to choose the arm of the Y-maze in which a shape-any shape-occurred above the referent, while those learning the concept of belowness had to pick the arm in which there was an arbitrary item beneath the referent. Here, we explore the sequential decision-making process that allows bees to solve this task by analyzing their flight trajectories inside the Y-maze. Over 368 h of high-speed video footage of the bees' choice strategies were analyzed in detail. In our experiments, many bees failed the task, and, with the possible exception of a single forager, bees as a group failed to reach significance in picking the correct arm from the decision chamber of the maze. Of those bees that succeeded in choosing correctly, most required a closeup inspection of the targets. These bees typically employed a close-up scan of only the bottom part of the pattern before taking the decision of landing on a feeder. When rejecting incorrect feeders, they repeatedly scanned the pattern features, but were still, on average, faster at completing the task than the non-leaners. This shows that solving a concept learning task could actually be mediated by turning it into a more manageable discrimination task by some animals, although one individual in this study appeared to have gained the ability (by the end of the training) to solve the task in a manner predicted by concept learning.","[Guiraud, Marie; Roper, Mark; Chittka, Lars] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England; [Roper, Mark] Ben Thorns Ltd, Drone Dev Lab, Colchester, Essex, England; [Chittka, Lars] Wissensch Kolleg, Inst Adv Study, Berlin, Germany",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Chittka, L (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England.;Chittka, L (corresponding author), Wissensch Kolleg, Inst Adv Study, Berlin, Germany.",l.chittka@qmul.ac.uk,"Guiraud, Marie-Genevieve/AAC-2105-2020; Chittka, Lars/C-3110-2012; Roper, Mark/AHB-3803-2022","Guiraud, Marie-Genevieve/0000-0001-5843-9188; Chittka, Lars/0000-0001-8153-1732; Roper, Mark/0000-0003-1135-6187",HFSP program [RGP0022/2014]; EPSRC program grant Brains-on-Board [EP/P006094/1]; EPSRC [EP/P006094/1] Funding Source: UKRI,HFSP program; EPSRC program grant Brains-on-Board(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"We thank Stephan Wolf, HaDi MaBouDi, Clint Perry, and Vera Vasas for helpful comments on the manuscript.

To address these issues, we propose UMATracker (Useful Multiple Animal Tracker), which supports flexible image preprocessing by visual programming, multiple tracking algorithms and a manual tracking error-correction system. UMATracker employs a visual programming user interface, wherein the user can intuitively design an image-processing pipeline. Moreover, the software also enables the user to visualize the effect of image processing. We implement four different tracking algorithms to enable the users to choose the most suitable algorithm.

The purpose of the present paper is to introduce this syntax in detail and to demonstrate its usefulness with four examples, each showing relevant aspects of the syntax.","[Buerkner, Paul-Christian] Univ Munster, Fac Psychol, Fliednerstr 21, D-48151 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Bürkner, PC (corresponding author), Univ Munster, Fac Psychol, Fliednerstr 21, D-48151 Munster, Germany.",paul.buerkner@gmail.com,,"Burkner, Paul-Christian/0000-0001-5765-8995",,,,,35,1342,1464,4,70,R FOUNDATION STATISTICAL COMPUTING,WIEN,"WIRTSCHAFTSUNIVERSITAT, INST STATISTICS & MATHEMATICS, AUGASSE 2-6, WIEN, 1090, AUSTRIA",2073-4859,,,R J,R Journal,JUL,2018,10,1,,,,,395,411,,,,,,17,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Mathematics,GP6NF,,,Y,N,2024-03-03,WOS:000440997400027,View Full Record in Web of Science

We investigate the ability to automatically, accurately, and inexpensively collect such data, which could help catalyze the transformation of many fields of ecology, wildlife biology, zoology, conservation biology, and animal behavior into big data sciences. Motion-sensor camera traps enable collecting wildlife pictures inexpensively, unobtrusively, and frequently. However, extracting information from these pictures remains an expensive, time-consuming, manual task. We demonstrate that such information can be automatically extracted by deep learning, a cutting-edge type of artificial intelligence. We train deep convolutional neural networks to identify, count, and describe the behaviors of 48 species in the 3.2 million-image Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our deep neural networks automatically identify animals with >93.8% accuracy, and we expect that number to improve rapidly in years to come. More importantly, if our system classifies only images it is confident about, our system can automate animal identification for 99.3% of the data while still performing at the same 96.6% accuracy as that of crowdsourced teams of human volunteers, saving >8.4 y (i.e., >17,000 h at 40 h/wk) of human labeling effort on this 3.2 million-image dataset. Those efficiency gains highlight the importance of using deep neural networks to automate data extraction from camera-trap images, reducing a roadblock for this widely used technology. Our results suggest that deep learning could enable the inexpensive, unobtrusive, high-volume, and even real-time collection of a wealth of information about vast numbers of animals in the wild.","[Norouzzadeh, Mohammad Sadegh; Clune, Jeff] Univ Wyoming, Dept Comp Sci, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Anh Nguyen] Auburn Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Kosmala, Margaret] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Swanson, Alexandra] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 3RH, England; [Palmer, Meredith S.; Packer, Craig] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Clune, Jeff] Uber Al Labs, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA",University of Wyoming; Auburn University System; Auburn University; Harvard University; University of Oxford; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Clune, J (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Comp Sci, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.;Clune, J (corresponding author), Uber Al Labs, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA.",jeffclune@uwyo.edu,"Palmer, Meredith S/D-5042-2014",,National Science Foundation CAREER Award [1453549]; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1453549] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation CAREER Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"We thank Sarah Benson-Amram, the SS volunteers, and the members of the Evolving AI Laboratory at the University of Wyoming for valuable feedback, especially Joost Huizinga, Tyler Jaszkowiak, Roby Velez, Henok Mengistu, and Nick Cheney.

Recent advances in technology allow researchers to automate the measurement of animal behaviour. These methods have multiple advantages over direct observations and manual data input as they reduce bias related to human perception and fatigue, and deliver more extensive and complete datasets that enhance statistical power. One major challenge that automation can overcome is the observation of many individuals at once, enabling whole-group or whole-population tracking. 2. We provide a detailed description of an automated system for tracking birds. Our system uses printed, machine-readable codes mounted on backpacks. This simple, yet robust, tagging system can be used simultaneously on multiple individuals to provide data on bird identity, position and directionality. Furthermore, because the backpacks are printed on paper, they are very lightweight. We show that our method is reliable, relatively easy to implement and monitor, and with proper handling, has proved to be safe for the birds over long periods of time. 3. We describe the deployment procedure of this system for a captive population of songbirds. We test different camera options, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In particular, we highlight how using single-board computers to control the frequency and duration of image capture makes this system affordable and adaptable to a range of study systems and research questions. 4. The ability to automate the measurement of individual positions has the potential to significantly increase the power of both observational and experimental studies. The system can capture both detailed interactions (using video recordings) and repeated observations (e.g. once per second for the entire day) of individuals over long timescales (months or potentially years). This approach opens the door to tracking life-long relationships among individuals, while also capturing fine-scale differences in behaviour.","[Alarcon-Nieto, Gustavo; Graving, Jacob M.; Klarevas-Irby, James A.; Maldonado-Chaparro, Adriana A.; Farine, Damien R.] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Chair Biodivers & Collect Behav, Constance, Germany; [Graving, Jacob M.; Maldonado-Chaparro, Adriana A.; Farine, Damien R.] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Collect Behav, Constance, Germany; [Mueller, Inge] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Migrat & Immunoecol, Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany",University of Konstanz; Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society,"Farine, DR (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Chair Biodivers & Collect Behav, Constance, Germany.;Farine, DR (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Collect Behav, Constance, Germany.",dfarine@orn.mpg.de,"Graving, Jake/ABB-7691-2020; Alarcon-Nieto, Gustavo/ACA-5214-2022; Farine, Damien R./Y-2454-2019","Graving, Jake/0000-0002-5826-467X; Farine, Damien R./0000-0003-2208-7613; Klarevas-Irby, James/0000-0001-7499-4085; Maldonado-Chaparro, Adriana A./0000-0003-0853-4966; Alarcon-Nieto, Gustavo/0000-0003-4076-3750",German Research Foundation [FA 1420/4-1]; Max Planck Society,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society),"Max Planck Society; German Research Foundation, Grant/Award Number: FA 1420/4-1",,54,40,42,2,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.","[Harrison, Xavier A.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England; [Donaldson, Lynda; Correa-Cano, Maria Eugenia; Goodwin, Cecily Ed; Robinson, Beth S.; Inger, Richard] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, England; [Donaldson, Lynda] Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, Slimbridge, Glos, England; [Evans, Julian; Fisher, David N.; Hodgson, David J.; Inger, Richard] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn, England; [Evans, Julian] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Fisher, David N.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Robinson, Beth S.] WildTeam Conservat, Padstow, England",Zoological Society of London; University of Exeter; University of Exeter; University of Ottawa; University of Guelph,"Harrison, XA (corresponding author), Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England.",x.harrison@ucl.ac.uk,"Goodwin, Cecily/HQZ-8035-2023; Harrison, Xavier/F-6420-2011; Fisher, David N/X-5498-2019; Inger, Richard/D-3445-2009","Goodwin, Cecily/0000-0003-0093-9838; Harrison, Xavier/0000-0002-2004-3601; Fisher, David N/0000-0002-4444-4450; Correa Cano, Maria Eugenia/0000-0002-2765-2792; Inger, Richard/0000-0003-1660-3706; Hodgson, Dave/0000-0003-4220-2076; Donaldson, Lynda/0000-0002-1892-3941","Institute of Zoology Research Fellowship; NERC [NE/H02249X/1, NE/L501669/1]; University of Exeter; Animal and Plant Health Agency as part of 'Wildlife Research Co-Operative'; CONACYT (The Mexican National Council for Science and Technology); SEP (The Mexican Ministry of Education); Forestry Commission",Institute of Zoology Research Fellowship; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); University of Exeter; Animal and Plant Health Agency as part of 'Wildlife Research Co-Operative'; CONACYT (The Mexican National Council for Science and Technology)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); SEP (The Mexican Ministry of Education); Forestry Commission,"Xavier A.

Knowing how many individuals are in a wildlife population allows informed management decisions to be made. Ecologists are increasingly using technologies, such as remotely piloted aircraft (RPA; commonly known as drones, unmanned aerial systems or unmanned aerial vehicles), for wildlife monitoring applications. Although RPA are widely touted as a cost-effective way to collect high-quality wildlife population data, the validity of these claims is unclear. 2. Using life-sized, replica seabird colonies containing a known number of fake birds, we assessed the accuracy of RPA-facilitated wildlife population monitoring compared to the traditional ground-based counting method. The task for both approaches was to count the number of fake birds in each of 10 replica seabird colonies. 3. We show that RPA-derived data are, on average, between 43% and 96% more accurate than the traditional ground-based data collection method. We also demonstrate that counts from this remotely sensed imagery can be semi-automated with a high degree of accuracy. 4. The increased accuracy and increased precision of RPA-derived wildlife monitoring data provides greater statistical power to detect fine-scale population fluctuations allowing for more informed and proactive ecological management.","[Hodgson, Jarrod C.; Kilpatrick, Adam D.; Segaran, Ramesh Raja; Koh, Lian Pin] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Mott, Rowan; Baylis, Shane M.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Pham, Trung T.; Reid, Ian] Univ Adelaide, Sch Comp Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Wotherspoon, Simon] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Wotherspoon, Simon; Terauds, Aleks] Antarctic Conservat & Management, Environm & Energy Dept, Australian Antarctic Div, Kingston, Tas, Australia",University of Adelaide; Monash University; University of Adelaide; University of Tasmania; Australian Antarctic Division,"Hodgson, JC (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",jarrod.hodgson@adelaide.edu.au,"Wotherspoon, Simon J/B-2390-2013; Mott, Rowan/ABA-9604-2021; Koh, Lian Pin/A-5794-2010; Terauds, Aleks/A-4991-2010","Wotherspoon, Simon J/0000-0002-6947-4445; Mott, Rowan/0000-0002-3508-6479; Koh, Lian Pin/0000-0001-8152-3871; Hodgson, Jarrod/0000-0003-0481-7360",Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; Australian Research Council; Conservation International,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Conservation International",Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; Australian Research Council and Conservation International,,45,250,263,13,127,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

The cost, usability and power efficiency of available wildlife monitoring equipment currently inhibits full ground-level coverage of many natural systems. Developments over the last decade in technology, open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage for conservation researchers and managers. 2. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost, small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: AudioMoth. The device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384 kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems. 3. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana) demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500 m, extending to 1 km with continuous recording. 4. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of similar to US$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys. With continuing developments in smart, energy-efficient algorithms and diminishing component costs, we are approaching the milestone of local communities being able to afford to remotely monitor their own natural resources.","[Hill, Andrew P.; Prince, Peter] Univ Southampton, Fac Phys Sci & Engn, Agents Interact & Complex Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Covarrubias, Evelyn Pina; Doncaster, C.

For example, globally, seabird populations are under threat and animal movement data can identify key at-sea areas and provide valuable information on the state of marine ecosystems. To date, in order to locate these areas, studies have used global positioning system (GPS) to record position and are sometimes combined with time-depth recorder (TDR) devices to identify diving activity associated with foraging, a crucial aspect of at-sea behaviour. However, the use of additional devices such as TDRs can be expensive, logistically difficult and may adversely affect the animal. Alternatively, behaviours may be resolved from measurements derived from the movement data alone. However, this behavioural analysis frequently lacks validation data for locations predicted as foraging (or other behaviours). Here, we address these issues using a combined GPS and TDR dataset from 108 individuals by training deep learning models to predict diving in European shags, common guillemots and razorbills. We validate our predictions using withheld data, producing quantitative assessment of predictive accuracy. The variables used to train these models are those recorded solely by the GPS device: variation in longitude and latitude, altitude and coverage ratio (proportion of possible fixes acquired within a set window of time). Different combinations of these variables were used to explore the qualities of different models, with the optimum models for all species predicting non-diving and diving behaviour correctly over 94% and 80% of the time, respectively. We also demonstrate the superior predictive ability of these supervised deep learning models over other commonly used behavioural prediction methods such as hidden Markov models. Mapping these predictions provides useful insights into the foraging activity of a range of seabird species, highlighting important at sea locations. These models have the potential to be used to analyse historic GPS datasets and further our understanding of how environmental changes have affected these seabirds over time.","[Browning, Ella] UCL, Ctr Biodivers & Environm Res, London, England; [Browning, Ella; Freeman, Robin] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England; [Bolton, Mark] RSPB Ctr Conservat Sci, Sandy, Beds, England; [Owen, Ellie] RSPB Ctr Conservat Sci, Inverness, Scotland; [Shoji, Akiko; Guilford, Tim] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England",University of London; University College London; Zoological Society of London; Royal Society for Protection of Birds; Royal Society for Protection of Birds; University of Oxford,"Browning, E (corresponding author), UCL, Ctr Biodivers & Environm Res, London, England.;Browning, E; Freeman, R (corresponding author), Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England.",ella.browning.14@ucl.ac.uk; robin.freeman@ioz.ac.uk,"Freeman, Robin/JOZ-4393-2023","Freeman, Robin/0000-0002-0560-8942; Bolton, Mark/0000-0001-5605-687X; Shoji, Akiko/0000-0003-3364-7786",Natural Environment Research Council [NE/L002485/1],Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/L002485/1",,54,57,63,1,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

The topical collection has two main goals. First, we briefly describe the history of POLS research and provide a refined definition of POLS that is applicable to various key levels of variation (genetic, individual, population, species). Second, we summarise the main lessons learned from current POLS research included in this topical collection. Based on an assessment of the current state of the theoretical foundations and the empirical support of the POLS hypothesis, we propose (i) conceptual refinements of theory, particularly with respect to the role of ecology in the evolution of (sexual dimorphism in) POLS, and (ii) methodological and statistical approaches to the study of POLS at all major levels of variation. This topical collection further holds (iii) key empirical examples demonstrating how POLS structures may be studied in wild populations of (non) human animals, and (iv) a modelling paper predicting POLS under various ecological conditions. Future POLS research will profit from the development of more explicit theoretical models and stringent empirical tests of model assumptions and predictions, increased focus on how ecology shapes (sex-specific) POLS structures at multiple hierarchical levels, and the usage of appropriate statistical tests and study designs. Significance statement As an introduction to the topical collection, we summarise current conceptual, theoretical, methodological and empirical progress in research on pace-of-life syndromes (POLSs), a framework for the adaptive integration of behaviour, physiology and life history at multiple hierarchical levels of variation (genetic, individual, population, species). Mixed empirical support of POLSs, particularly at the within-species level, calls for an evaluation and refinement of the hypothesis. We provide a refined definition of POLSs facilitating testable predictions. Future research on POLSs will profit from the development of more explicit theoretical models and stringent empirical tests of model assumptions and predictions, increased focus on how ecology shapes (sex-specific) POLSs structures at multiple hierarchical levels and the usage of appropriate statistical tests and study designs.","[Dammhahn, Melanie] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Dingemanse, Niels J.; Niemelae, Petri T.] LMU Munchen, Behav Ecol, Dept Biol, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Reale, Denis] Univ Quebec Montreal, Grp Rech Ecol Comportementale & Anim, Dept Sci Biol, CP 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",University of Potsdam; University of Munich; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Dammhahn, M (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",melanie.dammhahn@uni-potsdam.de; dingemanse@biologie.uni-muenchen.de; niemela@biologie.uni-muenchen.de; reale.denis@uqam.ca,"Dingemanse, Niels/ABE-6880-2020; Dammhahn, Melanie/AAD-5479-2019; REALE, Denis/AAG-1571-2020","Dingemanse, Niels/0000-0003-3320-0861; REALE, Denis/0000-0002-0419-7125; Niemela, Petri/0000-0002-7518-4057","Volkswagen Stiftung [Az. 89905]; DFG [DA 1377/2-1, DA 1377/2-2, NI 1539/1-1]; NSERC",Volkswagen Stiftung(Volkswagen); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"The authors thank all the participants of the two workshops Towards a general theory of the pace-of-life syndrome, held in Hannover in 2015 and 2016, for inspiring discussions as well as the Volkswagen Stiftung (Az. 89905) for generously funding these workshops.

Microfluidic lab on-a-chip technologies are perhaps one the most groundbreaking offshoots of bioengineering, enabling design of an entirely new generation of bioanalytical instrumentation. They represent a unique approach to combine microscale engineering and physics with specific biological questions, providing technological advances that allow for fundamentally new capabilities in the spatiotemporal analysis of molecules, cells, tissues, and even small metazoan organisms. While these miniaturized analytical technologies experience an explosive growth worldwide, with a substantial promise of a direct impact on biosciences, it seems that lab-on-a-chip systems have so far escaped the attention of aquatic ecotoxicologists. In this Critical Review, potential applications of the currently existing and emerging chip-based technologies for aquatic ecotoxicology and water quality monitoring are highlighted. We also offer suggestions on how aquatic ecotoxicology can benefit from adoption of microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices for accelerated bioanalysis.","[Campana, Olivia] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Marinas Andalucia, Puerto Real 11519, Spain; [Wlodkowic, Donald] RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3083, Australia",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias Marinas de Andalucia (ICMAN); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Wlodkowic, D (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3083, Australia.",donald.wlodkowic@rmit.edu.au,"Wlodkowic, Donald/P-4124-2019; campana, olivia/P-9207-2017; Wlodkowic, Donald/F-2431-2010","Wlodkowic, Donald/0000-0002-0780-3362; campana, olivia/0000-0002-3756-5254; Wlodkowic, Donald/0000-0002-0780-3362","Australian Research Council DECRA [DE130101046]; Vice-Chancellor's Senior Research Fellowship, RMIT University, Australia; Australian Government, Department of Defence","Australian Research Council DECRA(Australian Research Council); Vice-Chancellor's Senior Research Fellowship, RMIT University, Australia; Australian Government, Department of Defence(Australian Government)","The authors acknowledge grants sponsored by the Australian Research Council DECRA DE130101046 (D.W.), Vice-Chancellor's Senior Research Fellowship, RMIT University, Australia (D.W.), and Australian Government, Department of Defence (D.W.).",,137,31,33,1,78,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

Increased contamination is a well-known result of urbanization, and its effect on behaviour has been extensively studied. Yet, animal personality, consistent behavioural variation between individuals, has rarely been investigated in the context of anthropogenic contaminants. Changes in personalities may affect the viability of populations, and even alter community dynamics. We investigated the effects of exposure to a sublethal dose of the commonly used pesticide esfenvalerate on two personality traits, activity and boldness, and compared these effects between replicated rural and urban populations using larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella. We tested for effects on behaviour at three distinct levels: the average levels of behaviours, the consistency of behaviours (repeatability), and the structure of the behavioural correlations (behavioural syndrome). We found that the pesticide treatment changed the average activity and the behavioural covariation (activity and boldness), but not the behavioural repeatability. Importantly, these pesticide-induced patterns depended strongly on urbanization level. The average activity reduction due to pesticide exposure was only present in urban individuals. Moreover, while a behavioural correlation between activity and boldness in rural larvae appeared only after the pesticide treatment, this activity-boldness syndrome was consistently present in the urban larvae. These differential responses of urban and rural populations may be explained by the apparently more efficient coping mechanism with contaminants of urban populations, as well as the generally more stressful urban habitats. These results highlight the importance of measuring behavioural expressions at various levels when assessing contaminant effects, and not just the means. Further, we suggest that pollution may play an important role in understanding the evolution and maintenance of animal personalities in natural populations.

The glmmTMB package fits many types of GLMMs and extensions, including models with continuously distributed responses, but here we focus on count responses. glmmTMB is faster than glmmADMB, MCMCglmm, and brms, and more flexible than INLA and mgcv for zero-inflated modeling. One unique feature of glmmTMB (among packages that fit zero-inflated mixed models) is its ability to estimate the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution parameterized by the mean.

Intra-class correlations (ICC) and repeatabilities (R) are fundamental statistics for quantifying the reproducibility of measurements and for understanding the structure of biological variation. Linear mixed effects models offer a versatile framework for estimating ICC and R. However, while point estimation and significance testing by likelihood ratio tests is straightforward, the quantification of uncertainty is not as easily achieved. 2. A further complication arises when the analysis is conducted on data with non-Gaussian distributions because the separation of the mean and the variance is less clear-cut for non-Gaussian than for Gaussian models. Nonetheless, there are solutions to approximate repeatability for the most widely used families of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). 3.Here, we introduce the R package rptR for the estimation of ICC and R for Gaussian, binomial and Poisson-distributed data. Uncertainty in estimators is quantified by parametric bootstrapping and significance testing is implemented by likelihood ratio tests and through permutation of residuals. The package allows control for fixed effects and thus the estimation of adjusted repeatabilities (that remove fixed effect variance from the estimate) and enhanced agreement repeatabilities (that add fixed effect variance to the denominator). Furthermore, repeatability can be estimated from random-slope models. The package features convenient summary and plotting functions. 4.Besides repeatabilities, the package also allows the quantification of coefficients of determination R-2 as well as of raw variance components. We present an example analysis to demonstrate the core features and discuss some of the limitations of rptR.","[Stoffel, Martin A.] Bielefeld Univ, Dept Anim Behav, Morgenbreede 45, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Stoffel, Martin A.] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Fac Sci, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England; [Nakagawa, Shinichi] Univ New South Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Nakagawa, Shinichi] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Schielzeth, Holger] Bielefeld Univ, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Morgenbreede 45, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Schielzeth, Holger] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Populat Ecol Grp, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany",University of Bielefeld; Liverpool John Moores University; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Bielefeld; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Schielzeth, H (corresponding author), Bielefeld Univ, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Morgenbreede 45, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.;Schielzeth, H (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Populat Ecol Grp, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",holger.schielzeth@uni-jena.de,"Nakagawa, Shinichi/B-5571-2011; Schielzeth, Holger/F-1419-2011","Nakagawa, Shinichi/0000-0002-7765-5182; Stoffel, Martin/0000-0003-4030-3543; Schielzeth, Holger/0000-0002-9124-2261","Research Centre for Mathematical Modelling (RCM2); German Research Foundation [SCHI 1188/1-2]; Future Fellowship, Australia [FT130100268]","Research Centre for Mathematical Modelling (RCM2); German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Future Fellowship, Australia(Australian Research Council)","The package was motivated by the continued interest in and requests concerning an initial draft package on r-forge.

Here we present a novel positioning method called YAPS (Yet Another Positioning Solver), involving Maximum Likelihood analysis of a state-space model applied directly to time of arrival (TOA) data in combination with a movement model. YAPS avoids the sequential positioning-filtering-approach applied in alternative tools by using all available data in a single model, and offers better accuracy and error control. Feasibility and performance of YAPS was rigorously tested in a simulation study and by applying YAPS to data from an acoustic transmitter towed in a receiver array. Performance was compared to an alternative positioning model and proprietary software. The simulation study and field test revealed that YAPS performance was better and more consistent than alternatives. We conclude that YAPS outperformed the compared alternative methods, and that YAPS constitute a vast improvement to currently available positioning software in acoustic telemetry. Additionally, in contrast to vendor-supplied solutions, YAPS is transparent, flexible and can easily be adapted and extended for further improvements or to meet study specific requirements such as three-dimensional positioning.","[Baktoft, Henrik] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Gjelland, Karl Oystein] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-9007 Tromso, Norway; [Okland, Finn] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Thygesen, Uffe Hogsbro] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Technical University of Denmark,"Baktoft, H (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark.",hba@aqua.dtu.dk,"Thygesen, Uffe Høgsbro/AGI-6889-2022; Baktoft, Henrik/E-6581-2011; Thygesen, Uffe Høgsbro/HZL-5515-2023; Gjelland, Karl Oystein/I-7023-2012","Thygesen, Uffe Høgsbro/0000-0002-4311-6324; Baktoft, Henrik/0000-0002-3644-4960; Gjelland, Karl Oystein/0000-0003-4036-4207",Research Council of Norway (RCN); constellation of power companies in the RCN-projects SAFEPASS (ENERGIX program project) [244022]; CEDREN [226278]; Norwegian Institute for Nature Research; Danish Rod Fund; Net Fish License Fund; Villum Fonden [00007178] Funding Source: researchfish,Research Council of Norway (RCN)(Research Council of Norway); constellation of power companies in the RCN-projects SAFEPASS (ENERGIX program project); CEDREN; Norwegian Institute for Nature Research(Bioforsk); Danish Rod Fund; Net Fish License Fund; Villum Fonden(Villum Fonden),"We want to thank Torbjorn Forseth for his efforts to get this project funded, as well as Bjorgulv Foss, Torgeir Havn and Jan Gunnar Jensas for assistance in the field.

NTS has great potential for treatment assessment and pollutant prioritization within regulatory applications, as highlighted here by the case of real-time pollutant monitoring on the River Rhine.

We foresee multiplatform tracking systems for simultaneously monitoring the position, activity, and physiology of animals and the environment through which they are moving. Improved data collection will be accompanied by greater data accessibility and analytical tools for processing data, enabled by new infrastructure and cyberinfrastructure.

We show how the improved location accuracy of Fastloc-GPS compared to Argos tracking is expected to lead to far more accurate home range estimates, particularly for animals moving over the scale of a few km. We reach this conclusion using simulated data and home range estimates derived from empirical tracking data for green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) equipped with Argos linked Fastloc-GPS tags at three different foraging areas (western Indian Ocean, Western Australia, and Caribbean). Poor-quality Argos locations (e.g., location classes A, B) produced home range estimates ranging from 10 to 100 times larger than those derived from Fastloc-GPS data, whereas high-quality Argos locations (location classes 1-3) produced home range estimates that were generally comparable to those derived from Fastloc-GPS data. However, the limited number of Argos class 1-3 locations obtained for all three turtles-an average of 14.6 times more Fastloc-GPS locations were obtained compared to Argos class 1-3 locations-resulted in blurred patterns of space use. In contrast, the high volume of Fastloc-GPS locations revealed fine-scale movements in striking detail (i.e., use of discrete patches separated by just a few 100 m). We recommend careful consideration of the effects of location accuracy and data volume when developing sampling regimes for marine tracking studies and make recommendations regarding how sampling can be standardized to facilitate meaningful spatial and temporal comparisons of space use.","[Thomson, J.

We report the development of FreemoVR, a VR system for freely moving animals. We validate immersive VR for mice, flies, and zebrafish. FreemoVR allows instant, disruption-free environmental reconfigurations and interactions between real organisms and computer-controlled agents. Using the FreemoVR platform, we established a height-aversion assay in mice and studied visuomotor effects in Drosophila and zebrafish. Furthermore, by photorealistically mimicking zebrafish we discovered that effective social influence depends on a prospective leader balancing its internally preferred directional choice with social interaction. FreemoVR technology facilitates detailed investigations into neural function and behavior through the precise manipulation of sensorimotor feedback loops in unrestrained animals.","[Stowers, John R.; Hofbauer, Maximilian; Griessner, Johannes; Higgins, Peter; Haubensak, Wulf; Straw, Andrew D.] Vienna Bioctr, Res Inst Mol Pathol, Vienna, Austria; [Stowers, John R.; Hofbauer, Maximilian] Loopbio gmbh, Kritzendorf, Austria; [Hofbauer, Maximilian; Farooqui, Sarfarazhussain; Fischer, Ruth M.; Tessmar-Raible, Kristin] Univ Vienna, Max F Perutz Labs, Vienna, Austria; [Hofbauer, Maximilian; Farooqui, Sarfarazhussain; Tessmar-Raible, Kristin] Univ Vienna, Res Platform Rhythms Life, Vienna, Austria; [Bastien, Renaud; Couzin, Iain D.] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Collect Behav, Constance, Germany; [Bastien, Renaud; Couzin, Iain D.] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Chair Biodivers & Collect Behav, Constance, Germany; [Farooqui, Sarfarazhussain; Nowikovsky, Karin] Med Univ Wien, Dept Internal Med, Vienna, Austria; [Straw, Andrew D.] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Inst Biol 1, Freiburg, Germany; [Straw, Andrew D.] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Bernstein Ctr Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany",Vienna Biocenter (VBC); Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP); Medical University of Vienna; University of Vienna; Vienna Biocenter (VBC); Max F.

However, estimating R-2 for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have previously introduced a version of R-2 that we called R-2 GLMM for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions.

However, quantifying the behaviour of wild animals presents significant challenges. Remote-sensing camera traps are becoming increasingly popular survey instruments that have been used to non-invasively study a variety of animal behaviours, yielding key insights into behavioural repertoires. They are well suited to ethological studies and provide considerable opportunities for generating conservation-relevant behavioural data if novel and robust methodological and analytical solutions can be developed. This paper reviews the current state of camera-trap-based ethological studies, describes new and emerging directions in camera-based conservation behaviour, and highlights a number of limitations and considerations of particular relevance for camera-based studies. Three promising areas of study are discussed: (1) documenting anthropogenic impacts on behaviour; (2) incorporating behavioural responses into management planning and (3) using behavioural indicators such as giving up densities and daily activity patterns. We emphasize the importance of reporting methodological details, utilizing emerging camera trap metadata standards and central data repositories for facilitating reproducibility, comparison and synthesis across studies. Behavioural studies using camera traps are in their infancy; the full potential of the technology is as yet unrealized. Researchers are encouraged to embrace conservation-driven hypotheses in order to meet future challenges and improve the efficacy of conservation and management processes.","[Caravaggi, Anthony] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; [Banks, Peter B.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Burton, A.

These toxic pollutants are found worldwide, yet the long-term ecological effects on coral reef ecosystems are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that oil exposure spanning PAH concentrations that are environmentally relevant for many coastal marine ecosystems (<= 5.7 mu g I-1), including parts of the Great Barrier Reef, Red Sea, Asia and the Caribbean, causes elevated mortality and stunted growth rates in six species of pre-settlement coral reef fishes, spanning two evolutionarily distinct families (Pomacentridae and Lethrinidae). Furthermore, oil exposure alters habitat settlement and antipredator behaviours, causing reduced sheltering, shoaling and increased risk taking, all of which exacerbate predator-induced mortality during recruitment. These results suggest a previously unknown path, whereby oil and PAH exposure impair higher-order cognitive processing and behaviours necessary for the successful settlement and survival of larval fishes. This emphasizes the risks associated with industrial activities within at-risk ecosystems.","[Johansen, Jacob L.; Esbaugh, Andrew J.] Univ Texas, Dept Marine Sci, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA; [Allan, Bridie J.

In social bees, which are crucial pollination service providers, the effect of low-level chronic exposure is typically non-lethal leading researchers to consider whether exposure induces sublethal effects on behaviour and whether such impairment can affect colony development. Studies under laboratory conditions can control levels of pesticide exposure and elucidate causative effects, but are often criticized for being unrealistic. In contrast, field studies can monitor bee responses under a more realistic pesticide exposure landscape; yet typically such findings are limited to correlative results and can lack true controls or sufficient replication. We attempt to bridge this gap by exposing bumblebees to known amounts of pesticides when colonies are placed in the field. Using 20 bumblebee colonies, we assess the consequences of exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin, provided in sucrose at a concentration of five parts per billion, over 5weeks. We monitored foraging patterns and pollen collecting performance from 3282 bouts using either a non-invasive photographic assessment, or by extracting the pollen from returning foragers. We also conducted a full colony census at the beginning and end of the experiment. In contrast to studies on other neonicotinoids, showing clear impairment to foraging behaviours, we detected only subtle changes to patterns of foraging activity and pollen foraging during the course of the experiment. However, our colony census measures showed a more pronounced effect of exposure, with fewer adult workers and sexuals in treated colonies after 5weeks.Synthesis and applications. Pesticide-induced impairments on colony development and foraging could impact on the pollination service that bees provide. Therefore, our findings, that bees show subtle changes in foraging behaviour and reductions in colony size after exposure to a common pesticide, have important implications and help to inform the debate over whether the benefits of systemic pesticide application to flowering crops outweigh the costs. We propose that our methodology is an important advance to previous semi-field methods and should be considered when considering improvements to current ecotoxicological guidelines for pesticide risk assessment.

Here we use zebrafish larvae with pan-neuronal expression of GCaMP6s, combined with light sheet microscopy and a novel image processing pipeline, for the 4D profiling of chemoconvulsant action in multiple brain regions. In untreated larvae, regions associated with autonomic functionality, sensory processing and stress-responsiveness, consistently exhibited elevated spontaneous activity. The application of drugs targeting different convulsant mechanisms (4-Aminopyridine, Pentylenetetrazole, Pilocarpine and Strychnine) resulted in distinct spatiotemporal patterns of activity. These activity patterns showed some interesting parallels with what is known of the distribution of their respective molecular targets, but crucially also revealed system-wide neural circuit responses to stimulation or suppression. Drug concentration-response curves of neural activity were identified in a number of anatomically-defined zebrafish brain regions, and in vivo larval electrophysiology, also conducted in 4dpf larvae, provided additional measures of neural activity. Our quantification of network-wide chemoconvulsant drug activity in the whole zebrafish brain illustrates the power of this approach for neuropharmacological profiling in applications ranging from accelerating studies of drug safety and efficacy, to identifying pharmacologically-altered networks in zebrafish models of human neurological disorders.","[Winter, Matthew J.; Windell, Dylan; Metz, Jeremy; Hetheridge, Malcolm J.; Ball, Jonathan S.; Tyler, Charles R.] Coll Life & Environm Sci, Biosci, Exeter EX4 4QD, Devon, England; [Matthews, Peter; Pinion, Joe; Brown, Jonathan T.; Randall, Andrew D.] Univ Exeter, Med Sch, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; [Owen, Stewart F.] AstraZeneca, Global Compliance, Alderley Pk, Macclesfield SK10 4TF, Cheshire, England; [Redfern, Will S.] AstraZeneca R&D Innovat Med Drug Safety & Metab, Babraham Res Campus, Cambridge CB22 3AT, England; [Moger, Julian] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Phys & Med Imaging, Exeter EX4 4QL, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter; AstraZeneca; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Babraham Institute; University of Exeter,"Winter, MJ (corresponding author), Coll Life & Environm Sci, Biosci, Exeter EX4 4QD, Devon, England.",m.winter@exeter.ac.uk,"Owen, Stewart/ABF-1216-2021; Windell, Dylan/G-4937-2018","Winter, Matthew/0000-0002-3668-6564; Windell, Dylan/0000-0002-8188-6573; Ball, Jonathan/0000-0002-3046-3829; Randall, Andrew/0000-0001-8852-3671; Metz, Jeremy/0000-0002-8099-8776; Brown, Jonathan T/0000-0001-5269-7661; Owen, Stewart/0000-0003-1398-7142; Matthews, Peter/0000-0002-9098-5952","Biological and Biotechnology Research Council (CASE studentship) [BB/L502510/1]; University of Exeter; AstraZeneca; AstraZeneca Safety Health and Environment; BBSRC [BB/L020637/1, BB/P025528/1, BB/L01548X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [MC_PC_14127] Funding Source: UKRI; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [1490110, BB/L020637/1, BB/L01548X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [MC_PC_14127] Funding Source: researchfish; National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) [NC/C014103/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Biological and Biotechnology Research Council (CASE studentship)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); University of Exeter; AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca); AstraZeneca Safety Health and Environment; BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement & Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs))","The authors would like to thank the staff in the Aquatic Resources Centre at the University of Exeter, particularly Anna Tochwin, for the maintenance of the zebrafish brood stock and general technical assistance.

These are exciting new directions for the field, assisted in no small part by the adoption of mixed-effects modelling techniques that enable the partitioning of among- and within-individual behavioural variation. It has become commonplace to extract predictions of individual random effects from such models for use in subsequent analyses (for example, between a personality trait and other individual traits such as cognition, physiology, or fitness-related measures). However, these predictions are made with large amounts of error that is not carried forward, rendering further tests susceptible to spurious P values from these individual-level point estimates. We briefly summarize the problems with such statistical methods that are used regularly by behavioural ecologists, and highlight the robust solutions that exist within the mixed model framework, providing tutorials to aid in their implementation.","[Houslay, Thomas M.; Wilson, Alastair J.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England",University of Exeter,"Houslay, TM (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England.",t.houslay@exeter.ac.uk,"Houslay, Tom/H-6387-2019","Houslay, Tom/0000-0001-5592-9034",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/L022656/1]; BBSRC [BB/L022656/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/L022656/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),This work was supported by a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council grant (BB/L022656/1) awarded to A.J.W.,,86,179,203,4,67,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

The AUVs have been equipped with stereo-hydrophones that receive signals broadcasted by the acoustic transmitter tags to enable real-time calculation of bearing-to-tag and distance-to-tag measurements. These measurements are shared between AUVs via acoustic modem and fused within each AUV's particle filter for estimating the target's position. The AUVs use a leader/follower multi-AUV control system to enable the AUVs to drive toward the estimated target state by following collision-free paths. Once within the local area of the target, the AUVs circumnavigate the target state until it moves to another area. The system builds on previous work by incorporating a new SmartTag package that can be attached to an individual's dorsal fin. The SmartTag houses a full inertial measurement unit (INU), video logger, acoustic transmitter, and timed release mechanism. After real-time AUV tracking experiments, the SmartTag is recovered. Logged IMU data are fused with logged AUV-obtained acoustic tag measurements within a particle filter to improve state estimation accuracy. This improvement is validated through a series of multi-AUV shark and boat tracking experiments conducted at Santa Catalina Island, California. When compared with previous work that did not use the SmartTag package, results demonstrated a decrease in mean position estimation error of 25-75%, tag orientation estimation errors dropped from 80 degrees to 30 degrees, the sensitivity of mean position error with respect to distance to the tag was less by a factor of 50, and the sensitivity of mean position error with respect to acoustic signal reception frequency to the tag was 25 times less. These statistics demonstrate a large improvement in the system's robustness when the SmartTag package is used.

Radio-telemetry has been a cornerstone of tracking studies for over 50 years, and because of current limitations of geographic positioning systems (GPS) and satellite transmitters, has remained the primary means to track movements of small animals with high temporal and spatial precision. Automated receivers, along with recent miniaturization and digital coding of tags, have further improved the utility of radio-telemetry by allowing many individuals to be tracked continuously and simultaneously across broad landscapes. Motus is novel among automated arrays in that collaborators employ a single radio frequency across receiving stations over a broad geographic scale, allowing individuals to be detected at sites maintained by others. Motus also coordinates, disseminates, and archives detections and associated metadata in a central repository. Combined with the ability to track many individuals simultaneously, Motus has expanded the scope and spatial scale of research questions that can be addressed using radio-telemetry from local to regional and even hemispheric scales. Since its inception in 2012, more than 9000 individuals of over 87 species of birds, bats, and insects have been tracked, resulting in more than 250 million detections. This rich and comprehensive dataset includes detections of individuals during all phases of the annual cycle (breeding, migration, and nonbreeding), and at a variety of spatial scales, resulting in novel insights into the movement behavior of small flying animals. The value of the Motus network will grow as spatial coverage of stations and number of partners and collaborators increases. With continued expansion and support, Motus can provide a framework for global collaboration, and a coordinated approach to solving some of the most complex problems in movement biology and ecology.","[Taylor, Philip D.; Crysler, Zoe; Ronconi, Robert A.; Woodworth, Bradley K.] Acad Univ, Biol Dept, Wolfville, NS, Canada; [Taylor, Philip D.; Crewe, Tara L.; Mackenzie, Stuart A.; Lepage, Denis; Crysler, Zoe; Finney, George] Bird Studies Canada, Port Rowan, ON, Canada; [Crewe, Tara L.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada; [Aubry, Yves] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Francis, Charles M.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Guglielmo, Christopher G.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, Adv Facil Avian Res, London, ON, Canada; [Hamilton, Diana J.] Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB, Canada; [Holberton, Rebecca L.] Univ Maine, Lab Avian Biol, Orono, ME USA; [Loring, Pamela H.; Smetzer, Jennifer R.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Loring, Pamela H.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Div Migratory Birds, Hadley, MA USA; [Mitchell, Greg W.; Smith, Paul A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Norris, D.

Although zebrafish swim in a three-dimensional (3D) space, their behavior in the lab is almost exclusively scored in two dimensions, whereby zebrafish are recorded using a single camera providing 2D videos. Whether this dimensional reduction preserves the reliability of data has not been addressed. Here we show that, compared to a 3D observation, 2D data are flawed by over-reporting and under-reporting of locomotory differences. Specifically, we first reconstructed 3D trajectories through the integration of synchronous information derived from two cameras, and then compared them with the original 2D views in classical experimental paradigms assessing shoaling tendency, fear, anxiety, and general locomotion. Our results suggest that traditional behavioral scoring of individual zebrafish performed in 2D may undermine data integrity, thereby requiring a general reconsideration of scoring zebrafish behavior to incorporate a 3D approach. We then demonstrate that, compared to 2D, a 3D approach requires a reduced number of subjects to achieve the same degree of validity. We anticipate these findings to largely benefit animal welfare by reducing the number of experimental subjects, without affecting statistical power.","[Macri, Simone] Ist Super Sanita, Ctr Behav Sci & Mental Hlth, Viale Regina Elena 299, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Macri, Simone; Neri, Daniele; Ruberto, Tommaso; Mwaffo, Violet; Porfiri, Maurizio] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, MetroTech Ctr 6, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Butail, Sachit] Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Mech Engn, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA",Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS); New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering; Northern Illinois University,"Porfiri, M (corresponding author), NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, MetroTech Ctr 6, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.",mporfiri@nyu.edu,"Porfiri, Maurizio/A-1712-2009; Mwaffo, Violet/AAF-5143-2019; Butail, Sachit/O-2928-2013","Butail, Sachit/0000-0001-9785-7374; Porfiri, Maurizio/0000-0002-1480-3539; Macri, Simone/0000-0003-2946-4784; Mwaffo, Violet/0000-0001-7867-5305","National Science Foundation [CMMI-1433670, CMMI-1505832]; Mitsui USA Foundation; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering [1505832, 1433670] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Mitsui USA Foundation; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant # CMMI-1433670 and Grant # CMMI-1505832, and the Mitsui USA Foundation.",,33,30,32,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,MAY 16,2017,7,,,,,,,,1962,10.1038/s41598-017-01990-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-01990-z,,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,EV0CT,28512334,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-03-03,WOS:000401406700037,View Full Record in Web of Science

Research assessing the preference or avoidance of a water source containing specific chemical cues has increased in popularity in recent years, and a variety of methods have been described in the scientific literature. Two-current choice flumes have seen the greatest increase in popularity, perhaps because of their potential to address the broadest range of research questions. Here, we review the literature on two-current choice flumes and show that there is a clear absence of standardized methodologies that make comparisons across studies difficult. Some of the main issues include turbulent flows that cause mixing of cues, inappropriate size of choice arenas for the animals, short experiments with stressed animals, failure to report how experiment and researcher biases were eliminated, general underreporting of methodological details, underutilization of collected data and inappropriate data analyses. In this review, we present best practice guidelines on how to build, test and use two-current choice flumes to measure the behavioural responses of aquatic animals to chemical cues, and provide blueprints for flume construction. The guidelines include steps that can be taken to avoid problems commonly encountered when using two-current choice flumes and analysing the resulting data. This review provides a set of standards that should be followed to ensure data quality, transparency and replicability in future studies in this field.","[Jutfelt, Fredrik] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Jutfelt, Fredrik; Krang, Anna-Sara] Univ Gothenburg, Sven Loven Ctr Marine Sci, S-45178 Kristineberg, Fiskebackskil, Sweden; [Sundin, Josefin] Uppsala Univ, S-75124 Uppsala, Sweden; [Raby, Graham D.] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Krang, Anna-Sara] IVL Swedish Environm Res Inst, Kristineberg 566, S-45178 Fiskebackskil, Sweden; [Clark, Timothy D.] Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Clark, Timothy D.] CSIRO Agr & Food, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Gothenburg; Uppsala University; University of Windsor; IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute; University of Tasmania; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Jutfelt, F (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.;Jutfelt, F (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Sven Loven Ctr Marine Sci, S-45178 Kristineberg, Fiskebackskil, Sweden.",Fredrik.jutfelt@ntnu.no,"Jutfelt, Fredrik/B-6988-2014; Clark, Timothy/K-7129-2012","Jutfelt, Fredrik/0000-0001-9838-3991; Clark, Timothy/0000-0001-8738-3347; Sundin, Josefin/0000-0003-1853-4046","Swedish Research Council Swedish Research Council Formas [2013-947, 2009-596]; Swedish Research Council V.R.

We examined the rate of change in the production and variety of pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and other synthetic chemicals over the past four decades. We compared these rates to those for well-recognized drivers of global change such as rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, nutrient pollution, habitat destruction, and biodiversity loss. Our analysis showed that increases in synthetic chemical production and diversification, particularly within the developing world, outpaced these other agents of global change. Despite these trends, mainstream ecological journals, ecological meetings, and ecological funding through the US National Science Foundation devote less than 2% of their journal pages, meeting talks, and science funding, respectively, to the study of synthetic chemicals.","[Bernhardt, Emily S.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Rosi, Emma J.] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY USA; [Gessner, Mark O.] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Dept Expt Limnol, Berlin, Germany; [Gessner, Mark O.] Berlin Inst Technol, Dept Ecol, Berlin, Germany",Duke University; Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies; Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); Technical University of Berlin,"Bernhardt, ES (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",emily.bernhardt@duke.edu,"Bernhardt, Emily S/D-9940-2011; Bernhardt, Emily S/B-4541-2010; Rosi, Emma/F-1777-2011","Bernhardt, Emily S/0000-0003-3031-621X; Bernhardt, Emily S/0000-0003-3031-621X; Rosi, Emma/0000-0002-3476-6368",Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; IGB Fellowship in Freshwater Science,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); IGB Fellowship in Freshwater Science,"Support for the writing of this manuscript was provided by a Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and an IGB Fellowship in Freshwater Science to ESB.

Particularly concerning are pharmaceutical pollutants that can adversely impact exposed wildlife, even at extremely low concentrations. One such contaminant is the widely prescribed antidepressant fluoxetine, which can disrupt neurotransmission and behavioural pathways in wildlife. Despite this, relatively limited research has addressed the behavioural impacts of fluoxetine at ecologically realistic exposure concentrations. Here, we show that 28-day fluoxetine exposure at two ecologically relevant dosages one representing low surface water concentrations and another representing high effluent flow concentrations alters antipredator behaviour in Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). We found that fluoxetine exposure at the lower dosage resulted in increased activity levels irrespective of the presence or absence of a predatory dragonfly nymph (Hemianax papuensis). Additionally, irrespective of exposure concentration, fluoxetine-exposed fish entered the predator 'strike zone' more rapidly. In a separate experiment, fluoxetine exposure reduced mosquitofish freezing behaviour a common antipredator strategy following a simulated predator strike, although, in females, this reduction in behaviour was seen only at the lower dosage. Together, our findings suggest that fluoxetine can cause both non-monotonic and sex-dependent shifts in behaviour. Further, they demonstrate that exposure to fluoxetine at environmentally realistic concentrations can alter antipredator behaviour, with important repercussions for organismal fitness.

Phenotypic variation exists in and at all levels of biological organization: variation exists among species, among-individuals within-populations, and in the case of l within-populations abile traits, within-individuals. Mixed-effects models represent ideal tools to quantify multilevel measurements of traits and are being increasingly used in evolutionary ecology. Mixed-effects models are relatively complex, and two main issues may be hampering their proper usage: (i) the relatively few educational resources available to teach new users how to implement and interpret them and (ii) the lack of tools to ensure that the statistical parameters of interest are correctly estimated. In this paper, we introduce Statistical Quantification of Individual Differences (SQuID), a simulation-based tool that can be used for research and educational purposes. SQuID creates a virtual world inhabited by subjects whose phenotypes are generated by a user-defined phenotypic equation, which allows easy translation of biological hypotheses into quantifiable parameters. Statistical Quantification of Individual Differences currently models normally distributed traits with linear predictors, but SQuID is subject to further development and will adapt to handle more complex scenarios in the future. The current framework is suitable for performing simulation studies, determining optimal sampling designs for user-specific biological problems and making simulation-based inferences to aid in the interpretation of empirical studies. Statistical Quantification of Individual Differences is also a teaching tool for biologists interested in learning, or teaching others, how to implement and interpret linear mixed-effects models when studying the processes causing phenotypic variation. Interface-based modules allow users to learn about these issues. As research on effects of sampling designs continues, new issues will be implemented in new modules, including nonlinear and non-Gaussian data.","[Allegue, Hassen] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Marine Mammal Res Unit, Inst Oceans & Fisheries, 2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Araya-Ajoy, Yimen G.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Araya-Ajoy, Yimen G.; Dingemanse, Niels J.] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Res Grp Evolutionary Ecol Variat, Eberhard Gwinner Str, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany; [Dingemanse, Niels J.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol, Behav Ecol, Grosshadernerstr 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Dochtermann, Ned A.] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fargo, ND 58108 USA; [Garamszegi, Laszlo Z.] CSIC, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, C Americo Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Nakagawa, Shinichi] Univ New South Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Reale, Denis] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, CP 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Schielzeth, Holger] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Morgenbreede 45, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Schielzeth, Holger] Friedrich Schiller Univ, Populat Ecol Inst Ecol, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Westneat, David F.] Univ Kentucky, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Behav, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",University of British Columbia; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Max Planck Society; University of Munich; North Dakota State University Fargo; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Biologica de Donana (EBD); University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Bielefeld; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of Kentucky,"Dingemanse, NJ (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Res Grp Evolutionary Ecol Variat, Eberhard Gwinner Str, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany.;Dingemanse, NJ (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol, Behav Ecol, Grosshadernerstr 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.",n.dingemanse@lmu.de,"Nakagawa, Shinichi/B-5571-2011; Dingemanse, Niels/ABE-6880-2020; Allegue, Hassen/AAF-5996-2021; REALE, Denis/AAG-1571-2020; Schielzeth, Holger/F-1419-2011; Garamszegi, Laszlo Zsolt/M-1488-2015","Nakagawa, Shinichi/0000-0002-7765-5182; Dingemanse, Niels/0000-0003-3320-0861; Allegue, Hassen/0000-0001-9357-9151; REALE, Denis/0000-0002-0419-7125; Schielzeth, Holger/0000-0002-9124-2261; Garamszegi, Laszlo Zsolt/0000-0001-8920-2183","Volkswagen Foundation; International Max Planck Research School for Organismal Biology; Max Planck Society; Plan Nacional Program [CGL2015-70639-P]; National Research, Development and Innovation Office of Hungary [K-115970]; National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; German Research Foundation [SCHI 1188/1-1]; National Science Foundation of the U.S.A.; Australian Future Fellowship; Direct For Biological Sciences [1257718] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems [1257718] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen); International Max Planck Research School for Organismal Biology; Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society); Plan Nacional Program; National Research, Development and Innovation Office of Hungary(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary); National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); National Science Foundation of the U.S.A.(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Australian Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council); Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS))","SQuID was conceived at the Symposium 'Personality: Causes and Consequences of Consistent Behavioural Variation' funded by the Volkswagen Foundation (2013), and born and potty-trained during two follow-up workshop at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology (Seewiesen) funded by the Volkswagen Foundation (2014) and the International Max Planck Research School for Organismal Biology (2015).

While the exposome concept has been established for human health, its principles can be extended to include broader ecological issues. The assessment of exposure is tightly interlinked with hazard assessment. Here, we explore if mechanistit understanding of the causal links between exposure and adverse effects on human health and the environment can be improved by integrating the exposome approach with the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concept that structures and organizes the sequence of biological events from an initial molecular interaction of a chemical with a biological target to an adverse outcome. Complementing exposome research with the AOP concept may facilitate a mechanistic understanding of stress-induced adverse effects, examine the relative contributions from various components of the exposome, determine the primary risk drivers in complex mixtures, and promote an integrative assessment of chemical risks for both human and environmental health.

Consequently, these compounds are frequently identified in global waterways where they may pose a hazard to aquatic biota. Evidence demonstrates these compounds to be capable of influencing the behaviour of fish, but the relevance of many reported behavioural endpoints is unclear and the value of some findings has been questioned. Since these compounds act on neuroendocrine-mediated pathways in vertebrates, the present study explored how exposure to two representative SSRIs (fluoxetine and sertraline) and an SNRI (venlafaxine) affect circadian rhythms in fish. Male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) were exposed to 1, 10 and 100 mu g/L concentrations of these compounds individually and when present as a full mixture, for a period of one week. Neither fluoxetine nor sertraline had an impact on diurnal activity patterns when fish were exposed to these compounds alone at any concentration, whereas venlafaxine significantly disrupted normal circadian rhythmicity but only at 100 mu g/L. When fish were exposed to the full mixture, significantly altered diurnal activity patterns were rapidly observed at nominal concentrations of 1 and 100 mu g/L, but there was no effect at 10 mu g/L. This sort of non-monotonic dose relationship is not altogether unusual for fish exposed to antidepressants, but it poses a problem when attempting to evaluate potential risks to the aquatic environment. To evaluate the possibility for misinterpretation when collecting behavioural data over short temporal scales, the data for each day of the experiment was analysed separately. The outcomes demonstrate the importance of longer periods of data collection, which may be necessary to capture the full range of natural behavioural variability that exists both amongst and within individual fish. More importantly, these findings may help reveal why discrepancies are commonly being reported in the literature with regards behavioural effects in fish exposed to antidepressants. It is thus suggested that research be aimed at documenting behavioural variability in fish species used in toxicity testing, to establish guidelines for quality control and where possible inform the development of standardised methodologies so that behavioural analysis can be more appropriately applied to the broad field of aquatic toxicology.

Individual differences in movement and space-use, fundamental to many personality traits (e.g. activity, boldness and exploratory behaviour) have been documented across many species and contexts, for instance personality-dependent dispersal syndromes. Yet, insights from the concurrently developing movement ecology paradigm are rarely considered and recent evidence for other personality-dependent movements and space-use lack a general unifying framework. We propose a conceptual framework for personality-dependent spatial ecology. We link expectations derived from the movement ecology paradigm with behavioural reaction-norms to offer specific predictions on the interactions between environmental factors, such as resource distribution or landscape structure, and intrinsic behavioural variation. We consider how environmental heterogeneity and individual consistency in movements that carry-over across spatial scales can lead to personality-dependent: (1) foraging search performance; (2) habitat preference; (3) home range utilization patterns; (4) social network structure and (5) emergence of assortative population structure with spatial clusters of personalities. We support our conceptual model with spatially explicit simulations of behavioural variation in space-use, demonstrating the emergence of complex population-level patterns from differences in simple individual-level behaviours. Consideration of consistent individual variation in space-use will facilitate mechanistic understanding of processes that drive social, spatial, ecological and evolutionary dynamics in heterogeneous environments.","[Spiegel, Orr; Sih, Andrew] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Leu, Stephan T.; Bull, C.

Animals often respond behaviorally to environmental change, and multiple stressors can have both population-level and community-level effects. However, the individual, not combined, effects of stressors on animal behavior are commonly studied. There is a need to understand how animals respond to the more complex combinations of stressors that occur in nature, which requires a systematic and rigorous approach to quantify the various potential behavioral responses to the independent and interactive effects of stressors. We illustrate a robust, systematic approach for understanding behavioral responses to multiple stressors based on integrating schemes used to quantitatively classify interactions in multiple-stressor research and to qualitatively view interactions between multiple stimuli in behavioral experiments. We introduce and unify the two frameworks, highlighting their conceptual and methodological similarities, and use four case studies to demonstrate how this unification could improve our interpretation of interactions in behavioral experiments and guide efforts to manage the effects of multiple stressors. Our unified approach: (1) provides behavioral ecologists with a more rigorous and systematic way to quantify how animals respond to interactions between multiple stimuli, an important theoretical advance, (2) helps us better understand how animals behave when they encounter multiple, potentially interacting stressors, and (3) contributes more generally to the understanding of ecological surprises in multiple stressors research.","[Hale, Robin; Swearer, Stephen E.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Piggott, Jeremy J.] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Piggott, Jeremy J.] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga, Japan",University of Melbourne; University of Otago; Kyoto University,"Hale, R (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",robin.hale@unimelb.edu.au,"SWEARER, STEPHEN/AAC-1527-2020; Swearer, Stephen/X-4882-2018; Piggott, Jeremy/K-6157-2017","SWEARER, STEPHEN/0000-0001-6381-9943; Swearer, Stephen/0000-0001-6381-9943; Piggott, Jeremy/0000-0002-1515-1878",Australian Research Council [LP140100343]; Centre for Aquatic Pollution Identification and Management; Melbourne Water; Australian Research Council [LP140100343] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Centre for Aquatic Pollution Identification and Management; Melbourne Water; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"R.H. and S.S. acknowledge funding from the Australian Research Council (under LP140100343), the Centre for Aquatic Pollution Identification and Management, and Melbourne Water.",,33,34,38,1,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Of primary interest when deploying MHK devices is gaining an understanding of potential harmful interactions between marine animals and equipment at proposed development sites. Therefore, a high priority regulatory expectation exists to observe marine life interaction with such devices. Underwater video observation of MHK scenes is typically accomplished with optical or acoustical cameras. Traditional optical cameras are most effective when significant ambient light is present and in low turbidity. Even the most sophisticated commercially-available underwater camera technologies require artificial white light to illuminate low light scenes. This approach is not desirable for MHK monitoring because artificial light can alter the behavior of the animals being monitored. For example, it has been observed that marine life are attracted to light-emitting sources of wavelengths within their visual light frequency range. However, unlike active acoustic solutions, the primary advantage of using optical approaches is high resolution contrasted scene descriptions essential for object classification and detailed observations. Because red laser illuminators can be configured below the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) limit for humans, which is conservative with regard to marine wildlife due to the lower visual acuity of the eye, and also beyond the wavelength range that is visible to marine wildlife, such systems can be designed to be eye-safe, unobtrusive, and allow for 24/7 operations.","[Dalgleish, Fraser; Ouyang, Bing; Vuorenkoski, Anni; Ramos, Brian; Alsenas, Gabriel; Metzger, Benjamin] Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch, Ocean Visibil & Opt Lab, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA; [Cao, Zheng; Principe, Jose] Univ Florida, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Gainesville, FL USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Dalgleish, F (corresponding author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch, Ocean Visibil & Opt Lab, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA.",fdalglei@fau.edu,"Ouyang, Bing/AAD-8162-2019; principe, jose/N-8099-2014","Dalgleish, Fraser/0000-0003-1220-4935",US Department of Energy [DE-EE0006787],US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),This work was supported by US Department of Energy contract DE-EE0006787.,,10,5,5,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0197-7385,,978-1-5090-5278-3,OCEANS-IEEE,,,2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,"Acoustics; Engineering, Marine; Oceanography",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Acoustics; Engineering; Oceanography,BJ7BS,,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000426997002118,View Full Record in Web of Science

Exposing salmon smolt to a dilute concentration of a GABAA receptor agonist (oxazepam) increased migration intensity compared with untreated smolt.

At the same time, photo and video cameras can store a large number of video recordings and are often used to monitor the subjects remotely. Researchers frequently face the need to code considerable quantities of video recordings with relatively flexible software, often constrained by species-specific options or exact settings. BORIS is a free, open-source and multiplatform standalone program that allows a user-specific coding environment to be set for a computer-based review of previously recorded videos or live observations. Being open to user-specific settings, the program allows a project-based ethogram to be defined that can then be shared with collaborators, or can be imported or modified. Projects created in BORIS can include a list of observations, and each observation may include one or two videos (e.g. simultaneous screening of visual stimuli and the subject being tested; recordings from different sides of an aquarium). Once the user has set an ethogram, including state or point events or both, coding can be performed using previously assigned keys on the computer keyboard. BORIS allows definition of an unlimited number of events (states/point events) and subjects. Once the coding process is completed, the program can extract a time-budget or single or grouped observations automatically and present an at-a-glance summary of the main behavioural features. The observation data and time-budget analysis can be exported in many common formats (TSV, CSV, ODF, XLS, SQL and JSON).

The web-based Sequence Alignment to Predict Across Species Susceptibility (SeqAPASS; https://seqapass.epa.gov/seqapass/) application was developed to simplify, streamline, and quantitatively assess protein sequence/structural similarity across taxonomic groups as a means to predict relative intrinsic susceptibility. The intent of the tool is to allow for evaluation of any potential protein target while remaining amenable to variable degrees of protein characterization, in the context of available information about the chemical/protein interaction and the molecular target itself. To accommodate this flexibility in the analysis, 3 levels of evaluation were developed. The first level of the SeqAPASS analysis compares primary amino acid sequences to a query sequence, calculating a metric for sequence similarity (including detection of orthologs); the second level evaluates sequence similarity within selected functional domains (eg, ligand-binding domain); and the third level of analysis compares individual amino acid residue positions of importance for protein conformation and/or interaction with the chemical upon binding. Each level of the SeqAPASS analysis provides additional evidence to apply toward rapid, screening-level assessments of probable cross species susceptibility. Such analyses can support prioritization of chemicals for further evaluation, selection of appropriate species for testing, extrapolation of empirical toxicity data, and/or assessment of the cross-species relevance of adverse outcome pathways. Three case studies are described herein to demonstrate application of the SeqAPASS tool: the first 2 focused on predictions of pollinator susceptibility to molt-accelerating compounds and neonicotinoid insecticides, and the third on evaluation of cross-species susceptibility to strobilurin fungicides. These analyses illustrate challenges in species extrapolation and demonstrate the broad utility of SeqAPASS for risk-based decision making and research.","[LaLone, Carlie A.; Villeneuve, Daniel L.; Saari, Travis W.; Ankley, Gerald T.] US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Off Res & Dev, Mid Continent Ecol Div, Duluth, MN 55804 USA; [Lyons, David] US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Natl Ctr Computat Toxicol, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Helgen, Henry W.] CSC Govt Solut LLC, Willmar, MN USA; [Robinson, Serina L.] St Olaf Coll, Dept Chem, Northfield, MN USA; [Swintek, Joseph A.] Badger Tech Serv, Duluth, MN USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Saint Olaf College,"LaLone, CA (corresponding author), US EPA Mid Continent Ecol Div, 6201 Congdon Blvd, Duluth, MN 55804 USA.",lalone.carlie@epa.gov,"Lyons, David/G-3459-2011; Lyons, David/AAP-8600-2021; Robinson, Serina/ABD-8032-2021","Lyons, David/0000-0002-2966-5634; Lyons, David/0000-0002-2966-5634; Robinson, Serina/0000-0001-6947-7913",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency),This work was supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.,,65,90,99,2,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1096-6080,1096-0929,,TOXICOL SCI,Toxicol.

Until very recently, the complexity, weight and cost of such cameras have made their deployment in field situations risky; furthermore, such cameras are not affordable to many researchers. Here, we show how inexpensive, consumer-grade cameras can adequately accomplish these measurements both within the laboratory and in the field. Combined with our methods and open source software, the availability of inexpensive, portable and rugged cameras will open up new areas of biological study by providing precise 3D tracking and quantification of animal and human movement to researchers in a wide variety of field and laboratory contexts.","[Jackson, Brandon E.] Longwood Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Farmville, VA 23909 USA; [Evangelista, Dennis J.] US Naval Acad, Weap & Syst Engn, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA; [Ray, Dylan D.; Hedrick, Tyson L.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",Longwood University; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; United States Naval Academy; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Jackson, BE (corresponding author), Longwood Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Farmville, VA 23909 USA.",jacksonbe3@longwood.edu,"Hedrick, Tyson/GZH-3140-2022","Hedrick, Tyson/0000-0002-6573-9602",Office of Naval Research [N0001410109452]; National Science Foundation [IOS 1253276]; Longwood University's PRISM,Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Longwood University's PRISM,"The work was supported by the Office of Naval Research [grant number N0001410109452 to T.L.H. and eight others], by the National Science Foundation [grant number IOS 1253276 to T.L.H.], and by Longwood University's PRISM (to B.E.J.).",,23,55,69,2,15,COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 4DL, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2046-6390,,,BIOL OPEN,Biol.

Few studies have investigated these predicted life-history/personality associations among species and between sexes. Furthermore, whether and how contaminants interfere with POLS patterns remains unexplored. We tested for covariation patterns in life history and in behaviour, and for life-history/personality covariation among species, among individuals within species and between sexes. Moreover, we investigated whether pesticide exposure affects covariation between life history and behaviour and whether species and sexes with a faster POLS strategy have a higher sensitivity to pesticides. We reared larvae of four species of Ischnura damselflies in a common garden experiment with an insecticide treatment (chlorpyrifos absent/present) in the final instar. We measured four life-history traits (larval growth rate during the pesticide treatment, larval development time, adult mass and life span) and two behavioural traits (larval feeding activity and boldness, each before and after the pesticide treatment). At the individual level, life-history traits and behavioural traits aligned along a fast-slow and a proactive-reactive continuum, respectively. Species-specific differences in life history, with fast-lived species having a faster larval growth and development, a lower mass at emergence and a shorter life span, suggested that time constraints in the larval stage were predictably driving life-history evolution both in the larval stage and across metamorphosis in the adult stage. Across species, females were consistently more slow-lived than males, reflecting that a large body size and a long life span are generally more important for females. In contrast to the POLS hypothesis, there was only little evidence for the expected positive coupling between life-history pace and proactivity. Pesticide exposure decreased larval growth rate and affected life-history/personality covariation in the most fast-lived species. Our study supports the existence of life-history and behavioural continua with limited support for life-history/personality covariation. Variation in digestive physiology may explain this decoupling of life history and behaviour and provide valuable mechanistic insights to understand and predict the occurrence of life-history/personality covariation patterns.","[Debecker, Sara; Sanmartin-Villar, Iago; de Guinea-Luengo, Miguel; Stoks, Robby] Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Charles Deberiotstr 32,Bus 2439, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Sanmartin-Villar, Iago; Cordero-Rivera, Adolfo] Univ Vigo, Escola Enxenaria Forestal, Grp ECOEVO, Campus A Xunqueira S-N, Pontevedra 36005, Galiza, Spain",KU Leuven; Universidade de Vigo,"Debecker, S (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Charles Deberiotstr 32,Bus 2439, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",sara.debecker@bio.kuleuven.be,"Stoks, Robby/AAK-1227-2020; Sanmartín-Villar, Iago/L-3082-2019; Cordero-Rivera, Adolfo/K-4182-2014; Debecker, Sara/HJB-2368-2022","Sanmartín-Villar, Iago/0000-0002-5008-7613; Debecker, Sara/0000-0002-6097-5307; de Guinea, Miguel/0000-0002-8825-929X; Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459",Spanish Ministry [CGL2011-22629]; FEDER funds; FWO-Flanders [G.0704.13]; KULeuven Excellence Center Financing [PF/2010/07],Spanish Ministry(Spanish Government); FEDER funds(European Union (EU)); FWO-Flanders(FWO); KULeuven Excellence Center Financing,"We thank two anonymous reviewers and the associate editor for valuable comments on the manuscript, Cedric Vanappelghem, Christophe Brochard, Geert De Knijf, Rosa Ana Sanchez Guillen, Marie Van Dievel, Lieven Therry and Janne Swaegers for help with the collection of the damselflies, and Rony Van Aerschot and Ria Van Houdt for help during the laboratory experiment.

However, even sublethal concentrations of pollutants could be harmful if they combined with other factors to cause high mortality in amphibians. Here we show that sublethal concentrations of pollutants can disrupt the ability of amphibian larvae to recognize predators, hence increasing their risk of predation. This effect is indeed much more important since very low amounts of pollutants are ubiquitous, and environmental efforts are mostly directed towards preventing lethal spills. We analyzed the effects of two common contaminants (humic acid and ammonium nitrate) on the ability of tadpoles of the western spadefoot toad (Pelobates cultripes) to recognize chemical cues from a common predator, nymphs of the dragonfly Anax imperator. We compared the swimming activity of tadpoles in the presence and absence of water-borne chemical cues from dragonflies at different concentrations of humic acid and ammonium nitrate. Tadpoles reduced swimming activity in response to predator cues in the absence of pollutants, whereas they remained unresponsive to these cues when either humic acid or ammonium nitrate was added to the water, even at low concentrations. Moreover, changes in tadpole activity associated with the pollutants themselves were non-significant, indicating no toxic effect. Alteration of the natural chemical environment of aquatic systems by pollutants may be an important contributing cause for declines in amphibian populations, even at sublethal concentrations.

It is also one of the main steps in drug design. Animal models have been used for a long time for toxicity testing. However, in vivo animal tests are constrained by time, ethical considerations, and financial burden. Therefore, computational methods for estimating the toxicity of chemicals are considered useful. In silico toxicology is one type of toxicity assessment that uses computational methods to analyze, simulate, visualize, or predict the toxicity of chemicals. In silico toxicology aims to complement existing toxicity tests to predict toxicity, prioritize chemicals, guide toxicity tests, and minimize late-stage failures in drugs design. There are various methods for generating models to predict toxicity endpoints. We provide a comprehensive overview, explain, and compare the strengths and weaknesses of the existing modeling methods and algorithms for toxicity prediction with a particular (but not exclusive) emphasis on computational tools that can implement these methods and refer to expert systems that deploy the prediction models. Finally, we briefly review a number of new research directions in in silico toxicology and provide recommendations for designing in silico models.

We investigated the effects of the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos and the trematode parasite Euhaplorchis californiensis on three important traits of California killifish (Fundulus parvipinnis): neurotransmitter activity, release of the stress hormone cortisol, and behavior. Killifish were collected from a population without E. californiensis, and then half of the fish were experimentally infected. Following a 30 day period for parasite maturation, infected and uninfected groups were exposed to four concentrations of chlorpyrifos (solvent control, 1-3 ppb) prior to behavior trials to quantify activity, feeding behavior, and anti-predator responses. Water-borne cortisol release rates were measured non-invasively from each fish prior to infection, one-month post-infection, and following pesticide exposure. Killifish exposed to 3 ppb chlorpyrifos exhibited a 74.6 +/- 6.8% and 60.5 +/- 8.3% reduction in brain and muscle acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity relative to controls. The rate of cortisol release was suppressed by each chlorpyrifos level relative to controls. Killifish exposed to the medium (2 ppb) and high (3 ppb) pesticide concentrations exhibited reduced activity and a decrease in mean swimming speed following a simulated predator attack. Muscle AChE was positively related to swimming activity while brain AChE was positively related to foraging behavior. No effects of the parasite were observed, possibly because of low metacercariae densities achieved through controlled infections. We found that sublethal pesticide exposure has the potential to modify several organismal endpoints with consequences for reduced fitness, including neurological, endocrine, and behavioral responses in an ecologically abundant fish.

While results from such laboratory-based risk assessments may be difficult to extrapolate to natural environments, technological advancements over the past decade now make it possible to perform risk assessments through detailed studies of exposed individuals in natural settings. Acoustic telemetry is a technology to monitor movement and behaviour of aquatic organism in oceans, lakes, and rivers. The technology allows for tracking of multiple individuals simultaneously with very high temporal and spatial resolution, with the option to incorporate sensors to measure various physiological and environmental parameters. Although frequently used in fisheries research, aquatic ecotoxicology has been slow to adopt acoustic telemetry as a tool in field-based studies. This mini-review intends to introduce acoustic telemetry to aquatic ecotoxicologists, focusing on the potential of the technology to bridge the gap between laboratory assays and natural behaviours when making toxicological risk assessments.

Systematic mapping does not attempt to answer a specific question as do systematic reviews, but instead collates, describes and catalogues available evidence (e.g. primary, secondary, theoretical, economic) relating to a topic or question of interest. The included studies can be used to identify evidence for policy-relevant questions, knowledge gaps (to help direct future primary research) and knowledge clusters (sub-sets of evidence that may be suitable for secondary research, for example systematic review). Evidence synthesis in environmental sciences faces similar challenges to those found in social sciences. Here we describe the translation of systematic mapping methodology from social sciences for use in environmental sciences. We provide the first process-based methodology for systematic maps, describing the stages involved: establishing the review team and engaging stakeholders; setting the scope and question; setting inclusion criteria for studies; scoping stage; protocol development and publication; searching for evidence; screening evidence; coding; production of a systematic map database; critical appraisal (optional); describing and visualising the findings; report production and supporting information. We discuss the similarities and differences in methodology between systematic review and systematic mapping and provide guidance for those choosing which type of synthesis is most suitable for their requirements. Furthermore, we discuss the merits and uses of systematic mapping and make recommendations for improving this evolving methodology in environmental sciences.","[James, Katy L.; Randall, Nicola P.] Harper Adams Univ, Ctr Evidence Based Agr, Newport TF10 8NB, Shrops, England; [Haddaway, Neal R.] Stockholm Environm Inst, Mistra Council Evidence Based Environm Management, Stockholm, Sweden",Harper Adams University; Stockholm Environment Institute,"Randall, NP (corresponding author), Harper Adams Univ, Ctr Evidence Based Agr, Newport TF10 8NB, Shrops, England.",nrandall@harper-adams.ac.uk,"Lobo, Diele/I-9106-2012","Haddaway, Neal R/0000-0003-3902-2234; Randall, Nicola/0000-0002-3023-8488",,,,,56,364,376,3,26,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2047-2382,,ENVIRON EVID,Environ.

However, it is unclear how behavioral modifications recorded in laboratory assays are expressed in natural ecosystems, a limitation that makes it difficult to evaluate the predictive power of laboratory-based measurements. In this study, we hypothesized that exposure to a benzodiazepine (i.e., oxazepam) increases boldness and activity in laboratory assays as well as in field assays-that is, laboratory results can be used to predict field results. Moreover, we expected the modified behavior to affect other important ecological measures such as habitat selection and home range. To test our hypothesis, we exposed European perch (Perca fluviatilis) to oxazepam and measured subsequent changes in behavioral trials both in laboratory assays and in a lake ecosystem populated with a predatory fish species, pike (Esox lucius). In the lake, the positions of both perch and pike were tracked every 3 min for a month using acoustic telemetry. In the laboratory assay, the oxazepam-exposed perch were bolder and more active than the non-exposed perch. In the lake assay, the oxazepam-exposed perch were also more bold and active, had a larger home range, and used pelagic habitats more than the non-exposed perch. We conclude that ecotoxicological behavioral assays are useful for predicting the effects of exposure in natural systems. However, although individual responses to exposure were similar in both the laboratory and field trials, effects were more obvious in the field study, mainly due to reduced variability in the behavioral measures from the lake. Hence, short-term behavioral assays may fail to detect all the effects expressed in natural environments. Nevertheless, our study clearly demonstrates that behavioral modifications observed in laboratory settings can be used to predict how fish perform in aquatic ecosystems.","[Klaminder, Jonatan; Hellstrom, Gustav; Fahlman, Johan; Jonsson, Micael; Lagesson, Annelle; Brodin, Tomas] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden; [Fick, Jerker] Umea Univ, Dept Chem, Umea, Sweden; [Bergman, Eva] Karlstad Univ, Dept Environm & Life Sci, Karlstad, Sweden",Umea University; Umea University; Karlstad University,"Klaminder, J (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden.",jonatan.klaminder@umu.se,"Berglund Fick, Jerker/HDO-5788-2022; Bergman, Eva/R-8464-2016; Jonsson, Micael/E-6839-2012","Brodin, Tomas/0000-0003-1086-7567; Fick, Jerker/0000-0002-3949-7371; Klaminder, Jonatan/0000-0001-8814-0013",Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation,Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation(Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation),The study was financed through a fellowship to JK given by Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation.,,46,32,34,0,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Whereas parasite exposure is acknowledged as an important cause of these losses, the role of insecticides is controversial. Parasites and neonicotinoid insecticides reduce homing success of foragers (e.g. by reduced orientation), but it is unknown whether they negatively affect flight capacity. We investigated how exposing colonies to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid affect flight capacity of foragers. Flight distance, time and speed of foragers were measured in flight mills to assess the relative and interactive effects of high V. destructor load and a field-realistic, chronic sub-lethal dose of imidacloprid. Foragers from colonies exposed to high levels of V. destructor flew shorter distances, with a larger effect when also exposed to imidacloprid. Bee body mass partly explained our results as bees were heavier when exposed to these stressors, possibly due to an earlier onset of foraging. Our findings contribute to understanding of interacting stressors that can explain colony losses. Reduced flight capacity decreases the food-collecting ability of honeybees and may hamper the use of precocious foraging as a coping mechanism during colony (nutritional) stress. Ineffective coping mechanisms may lead to destructive cascading effects and subsequent colony collapse.","[Blanken, Lisa J.; van Langevelde, Frank] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Resource Ecol Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Blanken, Lisa J.; van Dooremalen, Coby] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Bees Wur, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"van Dooremalen, C (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Bees Wur, Droevendaalsesteeg 1, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",coby.vandooremalen@wur.nl,,"van Dooremalen, Coby/0000-0002-1525-0171; Van Langevelde, Frank/0000-0001-8870-0797",Ministry of Economic Affairs (EZ) of Netherlands [BO-20-003-003],Ministry of Economic Affairs (EZ) of Netherlands,This project was funded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EZ) of The Netherlands as part of a multifactorial experiment to study colony losses of honeybees during winter (BO-20-003-003).

Five years later, a substantially larger body of literature has solidified our understanding of plausible mechanisms underlying EDC actions and how exposures in animals and humans-especially during development-may lay the foundations for disease later in life. At this point in history, we have much stronger knowledge about how EDCs alter gene-environment interactions via physiological, cellular, molecular, andepigenetic changes, thereby producing effects in exposed individuals as well as their descendants. Causal links between exposure and manifestation of disease are substantiated by experimental animal models and are consistent with correlative epidemiological data in humans. There are several caveats because differences in how experimental animal work is conducted can lead to difficulties in drawing broad conclusions, and we must continue to be cautious about inferring causality in humans. In this second Scientific Statement, we reviewed the literature on a subset of topics for which the translational evidence is strongest: 1) obesity and diabetes; 2) female reproduction; 3) male reproduction; 4) hormone-sensitive cancers in females; 5) prostate; 6) thyroid; and 7) neurodevelopment and neuroendocrine systems. Our inclusion criteria for studies were those conducted predominantly in the past 5 years deemed to be of high quality based on appropriate negative and positive control groups or populations, adequate sample size and experimental design, and mammalian animal studies with exposure levels in arange that was relevant to humans. We also focused on studies using the developmental origins of health and disease model. No report was excluded based on a positive or negative effect of the EDC exposure. The bulk of the results across the board strengthen the evidence for endocrine health-related actions of EDCs. Based on this much more complete understanding of the endocrine principles by which EDCs act, including nonmonotonic dose-responses, low-dose effects, and developmental vulnerability, these findings can be much better translated to human health. Armed with this information, researchers, physicians, and other healthcare providers can guide regulators and policymakers as they make responsible decisions.

This policy decision is controversial given the absence of clear consistency between toxicity assessments of those substances in the laboratory and in the field. Although laboratory trials report deleterious effects in honeybees at trace levels, field surveys reveal no decrease in the performance of honeybee colonies in the vicinity of treated fields. Here we provide the missing link, showing that individual honeybees near thiamethoxam-treated fields do indeed disappear at a faster rate, but the impact of this is buffered by the colonies' demographic regulation response. Although we could ascertain the exposure pathway of thiamethoxam residues from treated flowers to honeybee dietary nectar, we uncovered an unexpected pervasive co-occurrence of similar concentrations of imidacloprid, another neonicotinoid normally restricted to non-entomophilous crops in the study country. Thus, its origin and transfer pathways through the succession of annual crops need be elucidated to conveniently appraise the risks of combined neonicotinoid exposures. This study reconciles the conflicting laboratory and field toxicity assessments of neonicotinoids on honeybees and further highlights the difficulty in actually detecting non-intentional effects on the field through conventional risk assessment methods.","[Henry, Mickael] INRA, Abeilles & Environm UR406, F-84914 Avignon, France; [Henry, Mickael; Cerrutti, Nicolas; Decourtye, Axel] UMT Protect Abeilles Environm, F-84914 Avignon, France; [Cerrutti, Nicolas; Gayrard, Melanie; Rueger, Charlotte] Ctr Grignon, Terres Inovia, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Aupinel, Pierrick; Odoux, Jean-Francois] INRA, UE1255, UE Entomol, F-17700 Surgeres, France; [Decourtye, Axel; Pissard, Aurelien] Assoc Coordinat Tech Agr, F-84914 Avignon, France; [Decourtye, Axel] ITSAP Inst Abeille, F-84914 Avignon, France; [Bretagnolle, Vincent] CNRS, UMR 7372, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Beauvoir Sur Niort, France; [Bretagnolle, Vincent] Univ La Rochelle, F-79360 Beauvoir Sur Niort, France; [Bretagnolle, Vincent] CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, LTER Zone Atelier Plaine & Val Sevre, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France",INRAE; INRAE; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); La Rochelle Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Henry, M (corresponding author), INRA, Abeilles & Environm UR406, F-84914 Avignon, France.",mickael.henry@paca.inra.fr,"ODOUX, Jean-François/AAB-3596-2019; Serrano, Jose/A-2854-2009; Aupinel, Pierrick/Y-5436-2019","ODOUX, Jean-François/0000-0002-6264-4376; Serrano, Jose/0000-0002-1565-5216;",Terres Inovia; French Ministry of Agriculture; European Community [797/2004]; ACTA; INRA SPE Division,Terres Inovia; French Ministry of Agriculture; European Community; ACTA; INRA SPE Division,"Funds for equipment and fieldwork were provided by Terres Inovia, the French Ministry of Agriculture and the European Community programme (797/2004) for French beekeeping coordinated by the French Ministry of Agriculture (RISQAPI project).

Previously utilized mainly in developmental biology and genetics, the zebrafish has turned out to possess a complex behavioral repertoire. For example, it is a highly social species, and individuals form tight groups, a behavior called shoaling. Social isolation induced changes in brain function and behavior have been demonstrated in a variety of laboratory organisms. However, despite its highly social nature, the zebrafish has rarely been utilized in this research area. Here, we investigate the effects of chronic social isolation (lasting 90 days) on locomotor activity and anxiety-related behaviors in an open tank. We also examine the effect of chronic social isolation on levels of whole-brain serotonin and dopamine and their metabolites. We found that long-term social deprivation surprisingly decreased anxiety-related behavious during open-tank testing but had no effect on locomotor activity. We also found that serotonin levels, decreased significantly in socially isolated fish, but levels of dopamine and metabolites of these neurotransmitters 5HIAA and DOPAC, respectively, remained unchanged. Our results imply that the standard high density housing employed in most zebrafish laboratories may not be the optimal way to keep these fish, and open a new avenue towards the analysis of the biological mechanisms of social behavior and of social deprivation induced changes in brain function using this simple vertebrate model organism.

Yet, the specific sampling schemes that optimize the power of an experiment to detect differences in random effects by treatment/group remain unknown. In this paper we develop a blueprint for conducting power analyses for GLMMs focusing on detecting differences in variance by treatment. We present parameterization and power analyses for random-intercepts and random-slopes GLMMs because of their generality as focal parameters for most applications and because of their immediate applicability to emerging questions in the field of behavioral ecology. We focus on the extreme case of hierarchically structured binomial data, though the framework presented here generalizes easily to any error distribution model. First, we determine the optimal ratio of individuals to repeated measures within individuals that maximizes power to detect differences by treatment in among-individual variation in intercept, among-individual variation in slope, and within-individual variation in intercept. Second, we explore how power to detect differences in target variance parameters is affected by total variation. Our results indicate heterogeneity in power across ratios of individuals to repeated measures with an optimal ratio determined by both the target variance parameter and total sample size. Additionally, power to detect each variance parameter was low overall (in most cases >1,000 total observations per treatment needed to achieve 80% power) and decreased with increasing variance in non-target random effects. With growing interest in variance as the parameter of inquiry, these power analyses provide a crucial component for designing experiments focused on detecting differences in variance. We hope to inspire novel experimental designs in ecology and evolution investigating the causes and implications of individual-level phenotypic variance, such as the adaptive significance of within-individual variation.","[Kain, Morgan P.; McCoy, MichaelW.] E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Bolker, Ben M.] McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Bolker, Ben M.] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, ON, Canada",University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; McMaster University; McMaster University,"Kain, MP (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",morganpkain@gmail.com,,"McCoy, Michael/0000-0002-7993-6236; Kain, Morgan/0000-0003-0605-7289; Bolker, Benjamin/0000-0002-2127-0443",East Carolina University,East Carolina University,"This research was supported through a new faculty start up grant from East Carolina University.

Recent innovations in tracking technology have allowed researchers to collect large and highly accurate datasets on animal spatiotemporal position while vastly decreasing the time and cost of collecting such data. One technique that is of particular relevance to the study of behavioral ecology involves tracking visual tags that can be uniquely identified in separate images or movie frames. These tags can be located within images that are visually complex, making them particularly well suited for longitudinal studies of animal behavior and movement in naturalistic environments. While several software packages have been developed that use computer vision to identify visual tags, these software packages are either (a) not optimized for identification of single tags, which is generally of the most interest for biologists, or (b) suffer from licensing issues, and therefore their use in the study of animal behavior has been limited. Here, we present BEEtag, an opensource, image-based tracking system in Matlab that allows for unique identification of individual animals or anatomical markers. The primary advantages of this system are that it (a) independently identifies animals or marked points in each frame of a video, limiting error propagation, (b) performs well in images with complex backgrounds, and (c) is low-cost. To validate the use of this tracking system in animal behavior, we mark and track individual bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) and recover individual patterns of space use and activity within the nest. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this software package and its application to the study of animal movement, behavior, and ecology.","[Crall, James D.; Gravish, Nick; Mountcastle, Andrew M.; Combes, Stacey A.] Harvard Univ, Concord Field Stn, Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Bedford, MA 01730 USA; [Gravish, Nick] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University,"Crall, JD (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Concord Field Stn, Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Bedford, MA 01730 USA.",james.crall@gmail.com,,"Gravish, Nicholas/0000-0002-9391-2476",NSF GRFP fellowship; NSF CAREER grant [IOS-1253677]; James S.

As environments are mostly unstable, it is now often assumed that genetic parental information is in many cases not sufficient for offspring to become optimally adapted to the environment and that early environmental cues, either indirectly via the parents or from direct experience, are necessary to prepare them for a specific environment later in life. To study whether these early developmental processes are adaptive and through which mechanism, not only the early environmental cues but also how they impinge on the later-life environmental context has therefore to be taken into account when measuring the animal's performance. We first discuss at the conceptual level six ways in which interactions between influences of different time windows during development may act (consolidation, cumulative information gathering and priming, compensation, buffering, matching and mismatching, context dependent trait expression). In addition we discuss how different environmental factors during the same time window may interact in shaping the phenotype during development. Next we discuss the pros and cons of several experimental designs for testing these interaction effects, highlighting the necessity for full, reciprocal designs and the importance of adjusting the nature and time of manipulation to the animal's adaptive capacity. We then review support for the interaction effects from both theoretical models and animal experiments in different taxa. This demonstrates indeed the existence of interactions at multiple levels, including different environmental factors, different time windows and between generations. As a consequence, development is a life-long, environment-dependent process and therefore manipulating only the early environment without taking interaction effects with other and later environmental influences into account may lead to wrong conclusions and may also explain inconsistent results in the literature.","[Groothuis, Ton G.

This hierarchy produces some fundamental challenges to clearly defining biological phenomena and constructing a consistent explanatory framework. We use a heuristic statistical model to explore two consequences of this hierarchy. First, although the variation existing among individuals within populations has long been of interest to evolutionary biologists, within-individual variation has been much less emphasized. Within-individual variance occurs when labile phenotypes (behaviour, physiology, and sometimes morphology) exhibit phenotypic plasticity or deviate from a norm-of-reaction within the same individual. A statistical partitioning of phenotypic variance leads us to explore an array of ideas about residual within-individual variation. We use this approach to draw attention to additional processes that may influence within-individual phenotypic variance, including interactions among environmental factors, ecological effects on the fitness consequences of plasticity, and various types of adaptive variance. Second, our framework for investigating variation in phenotypic variance reveals that interactions between levels of the hierarchy form the preconditions for the evolution of all types of plasticity, and we extend this idea to the residual level within individuals, where both adaptive plasticity in residuals and canalization-like processes (stability) can evolve. With the statistical tools now available to examine heterogeneous residual variance, an array of novel questions linking phenotype to environment can be usefully addressed.","[Westneat, David F.] Univ Kentucky, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Behav, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Wright, Jonathan] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Dingemanse, Niels J.] Univ Munich, Dept Biol, Behav Ecol, Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Dingemanse, Niels J.] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Evolutionary Ecol Variat Res Grp, Seewiesen, Germany",University of Kentucky; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Munich; Max Planck Society,"Westneat, DF (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Behav, Dept Biol, 101 Morgan Bldg, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",biodfw@uky.edu,"Dingemanse, Niels/ABE-6880-2020","Dingemanse, Niels/0000-0003-3320-0861; Westneat, David/0000-0001-5163-8096",Max Planck Society,Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society),"We thank our respective institutions and especially the Max Planck Society for supporting our initial conversations about these ideas.

Although sublethal doses of insecticides are known to alter behaviour, current studies on the relationship between toxicants and behaviour tend to ignore effects on individual variation. Our objective was to determine whether sublethal exposure to an organophosphate insecticide could affect the consistency of individual behaviour and disrupt behavioural correlations, in a jumping spider occurring in agroecosystems. Adults of the jumping spider Eris militaris (Araneae: Salticidae) were scored by an open-field and a prey-capture assay, each conducted pre- and post- exposure to the organophosphate insecticide phosmet. Half of the individuals received no exposure to the insecticide to provide a control group. We then estimated the changes in repeatability, a measure of the extent of personality differences, and in behavioural correlations between control and insecticide-treated groups. Although insecticide exposure had no discernable effects on the population's average behaviours, insecticide-exposed individuals showed an average of 23% lower repeatability and the correlation between activity and prey capture was more strongly collapsed in females. Our results provide clear evidence that exposure to sublethal doses of insecticides on an important arthropod predator in agroecosystems causes substantial alteration of personality differences even in absence of a population-wide shift in behaviour. This suggests that insecticide effects are more complex than previously thought and indicates high variation in the way individuals coped with insecticidal exposure. By altering the consistency of behavioural traits and their correlations, exposure to sublethal concentrations of insecticides can have subtle effects on behavioural expression, which may ultimately affect biocontrol performance in an important arthropod predator in agroecosystems. Our study calls for an increasing focus on individual behavioural variation when testing the effects of pesticides on non-targeted fauna.","[Royaute, Raphael; Buddle, Christopher M.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Royaute, Raphael; Vincent, Charles] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Hort Res & Dev Ctr, St Jean, PQ J3B 3E6, Canada",McGill University; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada,"Royauté, R (corresponding author), N Dakota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 1340 Bolley Dr, Fargo, ND 58102 USA.",raphael.royaute@gmail.com,"Royauté, Raphaël/B-9772-2015","Royauté, Raphaël/0000-0002-5837-633X; Buddle, Christopher/0000-0002-7494-9732",National Science and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC); Agriculture and Agri-food Canada; McGill University,National Science and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Agriculture and Agri-food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada); McGill University,"We thank Monique Audette, Gay Grunner and Mary Pavlik for access to field sites.

In particular, we discuss the importance of behavioral plasticity and whether adaptive plastic responses are sufficient in keeping pace with changing conditions. We then examine the interplay between individual behavioral responses and population processes and consider the many ways in which changes in behavior can affect ecosystem function and stability. Lastly, we turn to the evolutionary consequences of anthropogenic change and consider the impact of altered behaviors on the evolutionary process and whether behavior can facilitate or hinder adaptation to environmental change.","[Wong, Bob B.

Human actions generate acoustic noise, emanate artificial light and emit chemical substances. All of these pollutants are known to affect animals. Most studies on anthropogenic pollution address the impact of pollutants in unimodal sensory domains. High levels of anthropogenic noise, for example, have been shown to interfere with acoustic signals and cues. However, animals rely on multiple senses, and pollutants often co-occur. Thus, a full ecological assessment of the impact of anthropogenic activities requires a multimodal approach. We describe how sensory pollutants can co-occur and how covariance among pollutants may differ from natural situations. We review how animals combine information that arrives at their sensory systems through different modalities and outline how sensory conditions can interfere with multimodal perception. Finally, we describe how sensory pollutants can affect the perception, behaviour and endocrinology of animals within and across sensory modalities. We conclude that sensory pollution can affect animals in complex ways due to interactions among sensory stimuli, neural processing and behavioural and endocrinal feedback. We call for more empirical data on covariance among sensory conditions, for instance, data on correlated levels in noise and light pollution. Furthermore, we encourage researchers to test animal responses to a full-factorial set of sensory pollutants in the presence or the absence of ecologically important signals and cues. We realize that such approach is often time and energy consuming, but we think this is the only way to fully understand the multimodal impact of sensory pollution on animal performance and perception.","[Halfwerk, Wouter] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama; [Halfwerk, Wouter] Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Halfwerk, Wouter; Slabbekoorn, Hans] Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, NL-2300 Leiden, Netherlands",Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Halfwerk, W (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado 0843-03092, Balboa, Ancon, Panama.",wouter.halfwerk@gmail.com,"Halfwerk, Wouter/F-2211-2011; Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014","Halfwerk, Wouter/0000-0002-4111-0930",,,,,69,137,163,5,182,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1744-9561,1744-957X,,BIOL LETTERS,Biol.

The causes of these declines are diverse and not well understood. In some cases multiple stressors and complex causal mechanisms have been identified. Experimental studies have shown that contaminants can cause the failure of Lithobates sylvaticus tadpoles to initiate predator avoidance behaviors, potentially leading to increased tadpole capture and injury. Copper is a contaminant known to negatively affect amphibians and other aquatic organisms at sub-lethal levels. Mining waste, certain pesticides, vehicle exhaust and brake pad dust are sources of copper, which can enter hydrologic systems through runoff. Additionally, temperature is known to influence predator-prey interactions of ectotherms and is predicted to rise in some areas as climate changes. We examined how copper and temperature affected behavior and predation dynamics between an odonate predator (Aeshna sitchensis) and larval L. sylvaticus prey. We found that sublethal concentrations of copper near the analytical detection limits for this element (1.85 mu g Cu/L) significantly reduced tadpole and odonate activity. Above-average temperatures (22 degrees C) significantly increased tadpole activity and decreased dragonfly activity, compared with ambient-temperature treatments (17 degrees C). These behavioral responses culminated in an approximately three-fold increase in the number of dragonfly attacks on tadpoles in the elevated-temperature, copper-exposed treatments. We suggest that increased concentrations of dissolved copper and elevated water temperatures are harmful to amphibian prey through maladaptive behavioral responses in the presence of predators.","[Hayden, Mairin T.; King, Amanda L.; Tobin, S.

There have recently been calls to apply the same adaptive framework to interindividual differences in cognition. These calls have culminated in the suggestion that variation in personality and cognition should correlate. We suggest that both these appealing notions are conceptually and logistically problematic. We identify the first crucial step for establishing any cognition personality relationship. This is to determine the degree to which cognitive abilities yield consistent task performance. We then suggest how to establish whether such consistency exists. Finally, we discuss why formulating predictions about how cognition might be related to personality is much more difficult than is currently realised.","[Griffin, Andrea S.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Psychol, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Guillette, Lauren M.; Healy, Susan D.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 9TH, Fife, Scotland",University of Newcastle; University of St Andrews,"Griffin, AS (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Psychol, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",andrea.griffin@newcastle.edu.au,"Galef, Bennett G/A-5678-2008; Griffin, Andrea S/GWM-8557-2022; Guillette, Lauren/K-8154-2013","Griffin, Andrea S/0000-0003-4624-9904; Healy, Susan/0000-0002-8059-4480; Guillette, Lauren/0000-0002-8777-6543",University of Newcastle (Australia); Marie Curie Actions grant; Royal Society; British Academy (Newton International Fellowship); BBSRC [BB/I019502/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I019502/1] Funding Source: researchfish,University of Newcastle (Australia); Marie Curie Actions grant(Marie Curie Actions); Royal Society(Royal Society); British Academy (Newton International Fellowship); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),"We are grateful for funding from the University of Newcastle (Australia) and a Marie Curie Actions grant (A.S.G. and S.D.H.), and the Royal Society and the British Academy (Newton International Fellowship: L.M.G.).

Endangered species may be particularly at risk because inbreeding depression and stochastic fluctuations in male and female numbers are often observed in the small populations that typify these taxa. Here, we assessed the interactive effects of water temperature and EDC exposure on sexual development and population viability of inbred and outbred zebrafish (Danio rerio). Water temperatures adopted were 28 degrees C (current ambient mean spawning temperature) and 33 degrees C (projected for the year 2100). The EDC selected was clotrimazole (at 2 mu g/L and 10 mu g/L), a widely used antifungal chemical that inhibits a key steroidogenic enzyme [cytochrome P450(CYP19) aromatase] required for estrogen synthesis in vertebrates. Elevated water temperature and clotrimazole exposure independently induced male-skewed sex ratios, and the effects of clotrimazole were greater at the higher temperature. Male sex ratio skews also occurred for the lower clotrimazole exposure concentration at the higher water temperature in inbred fish but not in outbred fish. Population viability analysis showed that population growth rates declined sharply in response to male skews and declines for inbred populations occurred at lower male skews than for outbred populations. These results indicate that elevated temperature associated with climate change can amplify the effects of EDCs and these effects are likely to be most acute in small, inbred populations exhibiting environmental sex determination and/or differentiation.","[Brown, A.

Meta-analysis has become a standard way of summarizing empirical studies in many fields, including ecology and evolution. In ecology and evolution, meta-analyses comparing two groups (usually experimental and control groups) have almost exclusively focused on comparing the means, using standardized metrics such as Cohen's / Hedges' d or the response ratio. 2. However, an experimental treatment may not only affect the mean but also the variance. Investigating differences in the variance between two groups may be informative, especially when a treatment influences the variance in addition to or instead of the mean. 3. In this paper, we propose the effect size statistic lnCVR (the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation, CV, from two groups), which enables us to meta-analytically compare differences between the variability of two groups. We illustrate the use of lnCVR with examples from ecology and evolution. 4. Further, as an alternative approach to the use of lnCVR, we propose the combined use of ln s (the log standard deviation) and ln x (the log mean) in a hierarchical (linear mixed) model. The use of ln s with ln x =false overcomes potential limitations of lnCVR and it provides a more flexible, albeit more complex, way to examine variation beyond two-group comparisons. Relevantly, we also refer to the potential use of ln s and lnCV (the log CV) in the context of comparative analysis. 5. Our approaches to compare variability could be applied to already published meta-analytic data sets that compare two-group means to uncover potentially overlooked effects on the variance. Additionally, our approaches should be applied to future meta-analyses, especially when one suspects a treatment has an effect not only on the mean, but also on the variance. Notably, the application of the proposed methods extends beyond the fields of ecology and evolution.","[Nakagawa, Shinichi; Poulin, Robert; Lagisz, Malgorzata; Senior, Alistair M.] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, 340 Great King St, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Mengersen, Kerrie] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Sci & Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Reinhold, Klaus; Engqvist, Leif] Univ Bielefeld, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Senior, Alistair M.] Univ Sydney, Charles Perkins Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Senior, Alistair M.] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Otago; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Bielefeld; University of Sydney; University of Sydney,"Nakagawa, S (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, 340 Great King St, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",shinichi.nakagawa@otago.ac.nz,"Nakagawa, Shinichi/B-5571-2011; Poulin, Robert/GQO-8936-2022; Engqvist, Leif/C-3595-2009; Poulin, Robert/C-3117-2008; Lagisz, Malgorzata/A-3100-2010; Senior, Alistair/AAH-8409-2021; Mengersen, Kerrie/AHC-4096-2022","Nakagawa, Shinichi/0000-0002-7765-5182; Poulin, Robert/0000-0003-1390-1206; Engqvist, Leif/0000-0002-9434-7130; Poulin, Robert/0000-0003-1390-1206; Lagisz, Malgorzata/0000-0002-3993-6127; Mengersen, Kerrie/0000-0001-8625-9168",Rutherford Discovery Fellowship (New Zealand); German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 1232],Rutherford Discovery Fellowship (New Zealand)(Royal Society of New Zealand); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We are thankful to Holger Schielzeth, David Fletcher, two anonymous reviewers and the Editor, Bob O'Hara for comments, which improved our manuscript.

Personality differences can arise, for example, from differences in permanent environmental effects-including parental and epigenetic contributors- and the effect of additive genetic variation. Although several studies have evaluated the heritability of behaviour, less is known about general patterns of heritability and additive genetic variation in animal personality. As overall variation in behaviour includes both the among-individual differences that reflect different personalities and temporary environmental effects, it is possible for personality to be largely genetically influenced even when heritability of behaviour per se is quite low. The relative contribution of additive genetic variation to personality variation can be estimated whenever both repeatability and heritability are estimated for the same data. Using published estimates to address this issue, we found that approximately 52% of animal personality variation was attributable to additive genetic variation. Thus, while the heritability of behaviour is often moderate or low, the heritability of personality is much higher. Our results therefore (i) demonstrate that genetic differences are likely to be a major contributor to variation in animal personality and (ii) support the phenotypic gambit: that evolutionary inferences drawn from repeatability estimates may often be justified.","[Dochtermann, Ned A.; Schwab, Tori] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; [Sih, Andrew] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Dochtermann, NA (corresponding author), N Dakota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",ned.dochtermann@gmail.com,"Dochtermann, Ned A/A-7146-2010; Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",ND-EPSCoR programme; NSF [IOS 0952132],ND-EPSCoR programme; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"N.A.D. would like to thank the ND-EPSCoR programme for funding support, and A.

These proteinaceous seeds serve as templates for the conversion and replication of their benign cellular isoform. Accumulating evidence suggests that many protein aggregates can act as self-propagating templates and corrupt the folding of cognate proteins. Although aggregates can be functional under certain circumstances, this process often leads to the disruption of the cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis), eventually leading to devastating diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). The exact mechanisms of prion propagation and cell-to-cell spreading of protein aggregates are still subjects of intense investigation. To further this knowledge, recently a new metazoan model in Caenorhabditis elegans, for expression of the prion domain of the cytosolic yeast prion protein Sup35 has been established. This prion model offers several advantages, as it allows direct monitoring of the fluorescently tagged prion domain in living animals and ease of genetic approaches. Described here are methods to study prion-like behavior of protein aggregates and to identify modifiers of prion-induced toxicity using C. elegans.","[Nussbaum-Krammer, Carmen I.; Neto, Mario F.; Brielmann, Renee M.; Pedersen, Jesper S.; Morimoto, Richard I.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mol Biosci, Rice Inst Biomed Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Nussbaum-Krammer, CI (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Mol Biosci, Rice Inst Biomed Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",c.nussbaum@zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de,"Nussbaum-Krammer, Carmen/AAY-3081-2020","Nussbaum-Krammer, Carmen/0000-0002-8689-1363; Neto, Mario/0000-0002-6945-5607",National Institutes of Health (NIGMS); National Institutes of Health (NIA); National Institutes of Health (NINDS); Ellison Medical Foundation; Daniel F. and Ada L.

So far only minimal levels of automation have been adopted in ecotoxicology.

Miniaturized video cameras were utilized to monitor the amphipods movement patterns during the experiments. Furthermore innovative video analysis algorithms was applied for detection of sub-lethal endpoints such as changes in swimming activity that would otherwise go unnoticed.

Many aspects of animal behaviour differ consistently between individuals, giving rise to the growing field of animal personality research. While between-individual variation has long been of interest to biologists, the role of within-individual variation has received less attention. Indeed, many models assume that the extent of within-individual variation is the same across individuals despite the fact that individuals may often differ in their variability. Recently, the importance of within-individual variability or predictability has been recognized within the field of animal behaviour. However, there is a lack of a consensus on how best to quantify it. This situation, in turn, has led to the development of a variety of different methods aimed at assessing how variable or predictable different individuals are. Here, we review the indices that have been proposed as proxies of individual predictability. We then introduce existing techniques called hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLMs) and double-hierarchical generalized linear models (DHGLMs) as general tools for quantifying predictability. HGLMs and DHGLMs are extensions of random intercept mixed models that exploit the fact that variation in variances as well as variation in means can be modelled within a single overarching framework. Explicit modelling of the within-individual residual variation by (D)HGLMs makes more efficient use of the data, performs better on unbalanced data sets and captures more of the uncertainty involved in modelling within-individual variation than other proposed indices. In addition, (D)HGLMs yield an estimator of population-wide variation in predictability, which can serve as a standardized effect size for comparisons across traits and studies.

The different methods described here and the standardized effect size CVP should open new avenues for studying individuality in animal behaviour.

We assessed the accuracy of Fastloc-GPS locations using fixed trials of tags in which >45000 locations were obtained. Procedures for determining the speed of travel and heading were developed by simulating tracks and then adding Fastloc-GPS location errors. The levels of detail achievable for speed and heading estimates were illustrated by using empirical Fastloc-GPS data for a green turtle (Chelonia mydas, Linnaeus, 1758) travelling over 3000km across the Indian Ocean. The accuracy of Fastloc-GPS locations varied as a function of the number of GPS satellites used in the location calculation. For example, when Fastloc-GPS locations were calculated using 4 GPS satellites, 50% of locations were within 36m and 95% within 724m of the true position. These values improved to 18 and 70m, respectively, when 6 satellites were used. Simulations indicated that for animals travelling around 25kmh(-1) (e.g. turtles, penguins and seals) and depending on the number of satellites used in the location calculation, robust speed and heading estimates would usually be obtained for locations only 1-6h apart. Fastloc-GPS accuracy is several orders of magnitude better that conventional Argos tracking or light-based geolocation and consequently will allow new insights into small-scale movement patterns of marine animals.","[Dujon, Antoine M.; Hays, Graeme C.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Warrnambool, Vic 3280, Australia; [Lindstrom, R.

Previous studies examining Hg levels, trends, and effects on Arctic marine top predators have focused on the Arctic region. However, many of these top predators, such as seabirds, migrate to spend a large part of their life cycle far from the Arctic in areas where their exposure to contaminants is largely unknown. By combining biotelemetry and Hg and stable isotope analyses, we studied the seasonal Hg contamination of little auks (Alle alle, the most abundant Arctic seabird) in relation to their distribution and marine foraging habitat, as well as its potential impacts on bird reproduction. We show that little auks were similar to 3.5 times more contaminated when outside the breeding season, and that Hg that accumulated during this nonbreeding non-Arctic period was related to egg size the following season, with females having more Hg laying smaller eggs. Our results highlight that ecotoxicological studies should be expanded to yield a comprehensive understanding of contamination risks and associated threats to top predators over their entire annual cycle. Furthermore, we show that an important nonbreeding area located in the northwest Atlantic was associated with greater Hg contamination and demonstrate the utility of bird-borne miniaturized technology for evaluating the contamination of marine systems on large spatial scales.","[Fort, Jerome; Traisnel, Gwendoline; Bustamante, Paco] Univ La Rochelle, CNRS, UMR 7266, Littoral Environm & Soc, F-17000 La Rochelle, France; [Robertson, Gregory J.] Environm Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Mt Pearl, NF, Canada; [Gremillet, David] CNRS, UMR 5175, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Gremillet, David] Univ Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Percy FitzPatrick Inst, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); La Rochelle Universite; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; National Research Foundation - South Africa; University of Cape Town,"Fort, J (corresponding author), Univ La Rochelle, CNRS, UMR 7266, Littoral Environm & Soc, 2 Rue Olympe Gouges, F-17000 La Rochelle, France.",fort.jerome@gmail.com,"Fort, Jerome/F-1157-2016; Robertson, Greg/AAI-5849-2020; Bustamante, Paco/G-5833-2011; Gremillet, David/W-1946-2018","Fort, Jerome/0000-0002-0860-6707; Robertson, Greg/0000-0001-8452-5506; Bustamante, Paco/0000-0003-3877-9390; Gremillet, David/0000-0002-7711-9398",French Polar Institute Paul Emile Victor Grant [388]; European Commission (Marie Curie IEF) [273061]; Contrat de Projet Etat Region [CPER 13]; Region Poitou-Charentes; European Commission (Marie Curie CIG) [631203],French Polar Institute Paul Emile Victor Grant; European Commission (Marie Curie IEF); Contrat de Projet Etat Region; Region Poitou-Charentes(Region Nouvelle-Aquitaine); European Commission (Marie Curie CIG),"We are grateful to J.

Here, we review the available literature on insect telemetry using active (battery-powered) radio transmitters and compare this technology to harmonic radar and radio frequency identification (RFID) which use passive tags (i.e. without a battery). The first radio telemetry studies with insects were published in the late 1980s, and subsequent studies have addressed aspects of insect ecology, behaviour and evolution. Most insect telemetry studies have focused on habitat use and movement, including quantification of movement paths, home range sizes, habitat selection, and movement distances. Fewer studies have addressed foraging behaviour, activity patterns, migratory strategies, or evolutionary aspects. The majority of radio telemetry studies have been conducted outside the tropics, usually with beetles (Coleoptera) and crickets (Orthoptera), but bees (Hymenoptera), dobsonflies (Megaloptera), and dragonflies (Odonata) have also been radio-tracked. In contrast to the active transmitters used in radio telemetry, the much lower weight of harmonic radar and RFID tags allows them to be used with a broader range of insect taxa. However, the fixed detection zone of a stationary radar unit (< 1 km diameter) and the restricted detection distance of RFID tags (usually < 1-5 m) constitute major constraints of these technologies compared to radio telemetry. Most of the active transmitters in radio telemetry have been applied to insects with a body mass exceeding 1 g, but smaller species in the range 0.2-0.5 g (e. g. bumblebees and orchid bees) have now also been tracked. Current challenges of radio-tracking insects in the field are related to the constraints of a small transmitter, including short battery life (7-21 days), limited tracking range on the ground (100-500 m), and a transmitter weight that sometimes approaches the weight of a given insect (the ratio of tag mass to body mass varies from 2 to 100%). The attachment of radio transmitters may constrain insect behaviour and incur significant energetic costs, but few studies have addressed this in detail. Future radio telemetry studies should address (i) a larger number of species from different insect families and functional groups, (ii) a better coverage of tropical regions, (iii) intraspecific variability between sexes, ages, castes, and individuals, and (iv) a larger tracking range via aerial surveys with helicopters and aeroplanes equipped with external antennae. Furthermore, field and laboratory studies, including observational and experimental approaches as well as theoretical modelling, could help to clarify the behavioural and energetic consequences of transmitter attachment. Finally, the development of commercially available systems for automated tracking and potential future options of insect telemetry from space will provide exciting new avenues for quantifying movement and space use of insects from local to global spatial scales.","[Kissling, W.

It then uses these fingerprints to identify every individual throughout the video.

Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed for 6 weeks to 10 mu g L-1 of carbamazepine (CBZ) and gemfibrozil (GEM), two commonly prescribed drugs. Embryos were collected, reared in clean water until sexual maturity and then assessed for reproductive output, courtship, sperm function and organ histology. While 34% of the control pairs produced clutches, only 11% of the fish with CBZ exposed parents or 17% of the fish with GEM exposed parents produced clutches. Reciprocal crosses indicated that exposure in males had more profound reproductive effects. When a control F-1 male was crossed with either a F-1 female whose parents were CBZ or GEM exposed: no differences were observed in embryo production compared to controls. However, when a control F-1 female was crossed with either a CBZ or GEM F-1 male, 50% less embryos were produced. Male courtship was reduced in both CBZ and GEM F-1 fish but the deficits in courtship displays were drug specific. Compared to control males, the sperm from GEM F-1 males had shorter head lengths and midpieces whereas sperm from CBZ F-1 males had longer midpeices. Although it remains unclear how specifically these morphological differences influenced sperm velocity, the sperm from GEM F-1 males and from CBZ F-1 males swam faster than the sperm of control F-1 at 20 s post activation. No significant differences were observed in the histology of the liver, kidney and gonads across treatment groups. These data are important as they show that chronic, low dose pharmaceutical exposure of parental fish is sufficient to cause significant reproductive effects in offspring. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Others have also expressed concern. It is not uncommon for basic, but extremely important, factors to apparently be ignored. For example, exposure concentrations in laboratory experiments are sometimes not measured, and hence there is no evidence that the test organisms were actually exposed to the test substance, let alone at the stated concentrations. To try to improve the quality of ecotoxicology research, we suggest 12 basic principles that should be considered, not at the point of publication of the results, but during the experimental design. These principles range from carefully considering essential aspects of experimental design through to accurately defining the exposure, as well as unbiased analysis and reporting of the results. Although not all principles will apply to all studies, we offer these principles in the hope that they will improve the quality of the science that is available to regulators. Science is an evidence-based discipline and it is important that we and the regulators can trust the evidence presented to us. Significant resources often have to be devoted to refuting the results of poor research when those resources could be utilized more effectively.","[Harris, Catherine A.; Sumpter, John P.] Brunel Univ, Inst Environm, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Scott, Alexander P.] Cefas, Weymouth Lab, Weymouth DT4 8UB, Dorset, England; [Johnson, Andrew C.] CEH, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Panter, Grace H.] Astra Zeneca, Brixham Environm Lab, Brixham TQS 8BA, Devon, England; [Sheahan, Dave] Cefas, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft NR33 OHT, Suffolk, England; [Roberts, Mike] Defra, Chem & Emerging Technol Div, London SW1P 3JR, England",Brunel University; Centre for Environment Fisheries & Aquaculture Science; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); AstraZeneca; Centre for Environment Fisheries & Aquaculture Science,"Harris, CA (corresponding author), Brunel Univ, Inst Environm, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",Catherine.Harris@brunel.ac.uk,"sumpter, john/HGB-7584-2022; Scott, Alexander P/B-3845-2013; Johnson, Andrew/C-5551-2008","Panter, Grace/0000-0002-5272-6968; Johnson, Andrew/0000-0003-1570-3764; Scott, Alexander Pickering/0000-0002-5540-1317",NERC; Natural Environment Research Council [ceh010010] Funding Source: researchfish,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Many thanks to Luigi Margiotta-Casaluci, Martin Scholze, and David Taylor for their comments and insight into the manuscript and the issues surrounding this topic.

With improved visual and non-visual assessment tools and increased knowledge of the importance of behavior for organism health and fitness, interest in behavioral analysis has increased in recent years. However, to our knowledge there has never been a quantitative assessment of the available techniques for organismal toxicity testing, so it is not clear whether behavioral studies represent valuable additions to environmental monitoring. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the relative sensitivities and average durations of behavioral studies to those assessing acute lethality, development and reproduction. Results demonstrate that the average duration of behavioral studies is consistently less than developmental or reproductive studies, and that behavioral endpoints are generally more sensitive than those assessing development or reproduction. We found effect sizes to be lower but power to be higher in behavioral and reproductive studies compared to studies assessing development, which likely relates to low sample sizes commonly used in developmental studies. Overall, we conclude that behavioral studies are comparatively fast and sensitive, and therefore warrant further attention as tools for assessing the toxicological effects of environmental contaminants. We suggest that research aimed at developing and optimizing techniques for behavioral analysis could prove extremely useful to the field of toxicology, but that future work must be directed at determining what specific behaviors are most sensitive to various classes of contaminants, and at understanding the relevance of changes to discrete behaviors for influencing organismal and population-level health and fitness.

While rodents have traditionally represented the species of choice, a growing body of literature indicates that zebrafish are emerging as a valuable model organism. Specifically, several studies demonstrate that the effects of ethanol at the level of emotional- and cognitive-related domains can be reliably investigated using zebrafish. The rapidly evolving nature of these efforts allows substantial room for the development of novel experimental paradigms suited to this freshwater species. The field of ethorobotics may prove particularly beneficial, due to its ability to convey fully controllable and easily reproducible experimental tools. In this study, we addressed the possibility of using a biologically inspired robot to investigate the emotionally related properties of ethanol in a preference task in zebrafish. To this aim, we evaluated wild-type zebrafish preference toward a robotic stimulus and addressed whether ethanol administration (0.25% and 1.00% ethanol/water concentration) may alter such preferences. In accordance with our previous studies, we observed that zebrafish exhibit a natural attraction toward the robot. Additionally, in agreement with our predictions, we showed that ethanol administration abolishes such preferences. This work is the first to demonstrate that robotic stimuli can be used in zebrafish to investigate the reward-related properties of alcohol. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The robot's propulsion system is experimentally characterized for different caudal fin geometries by using an ad hoc thrust-measurement system. The static thrust produced by the vibrating tail is expressed in terms of the oscillatory Reynolds number and compared with similar findings in the literature. Nonlinear vibrations of the propulsive tail are modeled using modal analysis and classical results from the study of large vibrations of slender cylinders in fluids. This analysis allows for computing the oscillatory Reynolds number in terms of the input parameters to the tail vibration. Free-swimming experiments are performed to investigate the performance and maneuverability of the robot and correlate static thrust with terminal speed.

Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.","[Nakagawa, Shinichi] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Natl Ctr Growth & Dev, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Nakagawa, Shinichi] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany; [Schielzeth, Holger] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Evolutionary Biol, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Otago; Max Planck Society; University of Bielefeld,"Nakagawa, S (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Natl Ctr Growth & Dev, 340 Great King St, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",shinichi.nakagawa@otago.ac.nz,"Nakagawa, Shinichi/B-5571-2011; Schielzeth, Holger/F-1419-2011","Nakagawa, Shinichi/0000-0002-7765-5182; Schielzeth, Holger/0000-0002-9124-2261",German Research Foundation [SCHI 1188/1-1],German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank S.

Experiments are conducted in a three-chambered instrumented water tank where a robotic-fish is juxtaposed with an empty compartment, and the preference of live subjects is scored as the mean time spent in the vicinity of the tank's two lateral sides. The tail-beating of the robotic-fish is controlled in real-time based on feedback from fish motion to explore a spectrum of closed-loop systems, including proportional and integral controllers. Closed-loop control systems are complemented by open-loop strategies, wherein the tail-beat of the robotic-fish is independent of the fish motion. The preference space and the locomotory patterns of fish for each experimental condition are analysed and compared to understand the influence of real-time closed-loop control on zebrafish response. The results of this study show that zebrafish respond differently to the pattern of tail-beating motion executed by the robotic-fish. Specifically, the preference and behaviour of zebrafish depend on whether the robotic-fish tail-beating frequency is controlled as a function of fish motion and how such closed-loop control is implemented.","[Kopman, Vladislav; Laut, Jeffrey; Polverino, Giovanni; Porfiri, Maurizio] NYU, Polytech Inst, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, MetroTech Ctr 6, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA",New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering,"Porfiri, M (corresponding author), NYU, Polytech Inst, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, MetroTech Ctr 6, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.",mporfiri@poly.edu,"Polverino, Giovanni/AAC-2556-2020; Porfiri, Maurizio/A-1712-2009","Polverino, Giovanni/0000-0001-9737-7995; Porfiri, Maurizio/0000-0002-1480-3539","National Science Foundation [CMMI-0745753, DGE-0741714, DGE-1104522]; Honors Center of Italian Universities (H2CU); Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering [0745753] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Honors Center of Italian Universities (H2CU); Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","The authors gratefully acknowledge Drs F.

The study of individual variation requires tools for quantification and decomposition of phenotypic variation into between- and within-individual components. This is essential as variance components differ in their ecological and evolutionary implications. We provide an overview of how mixed-effect models can be used to partition variation in, and correlations among, phenotypic attributes into between- and within-individual variance components. Optimal sampling schemes to accurately estimate (with sufficient power) a wide range of repeatabilities and key (co)variance components, such as between- and within-individual correlations, are detailed.

One intriguing possibility is that variation in cognition is functionally related to variation in personality. Here, we review some examples and present hypotheses on relationships between personality (or behavioural syndromes) and individual differences in cognitive style. Our hypotheses are based largely on a connection between fast-slow behavioural types (BTs; e.g. boldness, aggressiveness, exploration tendency) and cognitive speed-accuracy trade-offs. We also discuss connections between BTs, cognition and ecologically important aspects of decision-making, including sampling, impulsivity, risk sensitivity and choosiness. Finally, we introduce the notion of cognition syndromes, and apply ideas from theories on adaptive behavioural syndromes to generate predictions on cognition syndromes.","[Sih, Andrew] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Del Giudice, Marco] Univ Turin, Dept Psychol, I-10123 Turin, Italy",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Turin,"Sih, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",asih@ucdavis.edu,"Del Giudice, Marco/F-7007-2010; Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Del Giudice, Marco/0000-0001-8526-1573; Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",,,,,78,437,464,8,368,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8436,1471-2970,,PHILOS T R SOC B,Philos.

Photographic markrecapture is a cost-effective, non-invasive way to study populations. However, to efficiently apply photographic markrecapture to large populations, computer software is needed for image manipulation and pattern matching. 2. We created an open-source application for the storage, pattern extraction and pattern matching of digital images for the purposes of markrecapture analysis. The resulting software package is a stand-alone, multiplatform application implemented in Java. Our program employs the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) operator that extracts distinctive features invariant to image scale and rotation. 3. We applied this system to a population of Masai giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) in the Tarangire Ecosystem in northern Tanzania. Over 1200 images were acquired in the field during three primary sampling periods between September 2008 and December 2009. The pattern information in these images was extracted and matched resulting in capture histories for over 600 unique individuals. 4. Estimated error rates of the matching system were low based on a subset of test images that were independently matched by eye. 5. Encounter histories were subsequently analysed with open population models to estimate apparent survival rates and population size. 6. This new open-access tool allowed photographic markrecapture to be applied successfully to this relatively large population.","[Bolger, Douglas T.] Dartmouth Coll, Environm Studies Program, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Morrison, Thomas A.; Lee, Derek] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Vance, Bennet; Farid, Hany] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Dartmouth College; Dartmouth College; Dartmouth College,"Bolger, DT (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Environm Studies Program, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",dbolger@dartmouth.edu,"Lee, Derek E./E-1131-2013","Lee, Derek E./0000-0002-1042-9543",National Science Foundation [0754773]; Neukom Institute for Computational Science at Dartmouth College; Marion and Jasper Whiting Foundation; Nelson A.

We determined toxicity parameters of the fungicide trifloxystrobin (TFS) and examined its effects on predation rate, using a fish predator (Synbranchus marmoratus) and four anuran tadpole species as prey (Rhinella arenarum, Physalaemus santafecinus, Leptodactylus latrans, and Elachistocleis bicolor). TFS was not equally toxic to the four tadpole species, E. bicolor being the most sensitive species, followed by P. santafecinus, R. arenarum, and L latrans. Predation rates were evaluated using different treatments that combined predator and prey exposed or not to this fungicide. TFS would alter the outcome of eel-tadpole interaction by reducing prey movements; thus, prey detection would decrease and therefore tadpole survival would increase. In addition, eels preyed selectively upon non-exposed tadpoles avoiding the exposed ones almost all throughout the period evaluated. Predation rate differed among prey species; such differences were not due to TFS exposure, but to interspecific differences in behavior. The mechanism that would explain TFS-induced reduction in predation rates remains unclear; however, what is clear is that sublethal TFS concentrations have the potential to alter prey behavior, thereby indirectly altering predator-prey interactions. In addition, we consider that predator-prey relationships are measurable responses of toxicant exposure and provide ecological insight into how contaminants modify predator-prey interactions.

However, the ecological consequences of such behavioral changes, such as effects on toxicant transfer in foodwebs, are far less well understood, complicated in part by the short-term nature of laboratory experiments and the lack of complementary field studies where the nature of toxicant exposure is more complex. Here we examine whether naturally exposed individuals of the round goby, a benthic, site-loyal fish, move in a manner similar to conspecifics from less contaminated habitats. In the laboratory, round goby from a relatively cleaner site showed greater activity and exploration than goby from two highly contaminated sites. Male fish were more active than females but the site effects were similar in both sexes. In contrast to laboratory findings, a field mark-recapture study of 881 round goby showed that fish from the cleaner site did not move greater distances or exhibit shorter residence times within the site than round goby from highly contaminated sites. Our results indicate that while behavioral changes in the laboratory may be one of several useful diagnostics of toxicant exposure of wild-exposed animals, they do not necessarily translate readily into measurable differences in a natural context. Thus, the potential fitness consequences of toxicant exposure based on behavioral changes need to be assessed carefully.","[Marentette, Julie R.; Tong, Stephanie; Wang, Grace; Sopinka, Natalie M.; Taves, Matthew D.; Balshine, Sigal] McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Koops, Marten A.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Great Lakes Lab Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Burlington, ON, Canada",McMaster University; Fisheries & Oceans Canada,"Marentette, JR (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",marentjr@mcmaster.ca,"Taves, Matthew Donald/AAW-3148-2020; Koops, Marten/A-4534-2010","Taves, Matthew Donald/0000-0002-4841-059X; Koops, Marten/0000-0002-3676-7946; Balshine, Sigal/0000-0003-3671-0517",NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada); Canadian Foundation for Innovation; NSERC,NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canadian Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for Innovation); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"We thank Susan Marsh-Rollo of McMaster University and Tys Theysmeyer and field crew of the Royal Botanical Gardens for valuable field advice and assistance.

This technology offers researchers the opportunity to monitor the finite-to broad-scale movements of multiple individuals over many years; however, the sheer scale and spatial complexity of these datasets are often beyond the capabilities of routine database and spread-sheet applications. In the present paper, we describe software (V-Track) that greatly facilitates the assimilation, analysis and synthesis of animal-location data collected by underwater passive acoustic receivers. The principal features within V-Track are the behavioural event qualifier (BEQ) and the receiver-distance matrix (RDM) calculator. The BEQ identifies and catalogues horizontal movements from receiver detection data, or vertical movements from transmitter sensor data (depth or temperature). The RDMis generated from the geographical location of the acoustic receivers and is utilised by V-Track to illustrate the behavioural event information in a spatial context. V-Track is a package written within the R-programming language, and a graphical user interface is also provided.

Here, we survey the latest developments in this area and discuss the various computational approaches, software tools, and quantitative measures for tracking and motion analysis of cells and particles in time-lapse microscopy images.","[Meijering, Erik; Dzyubachyk, Oleh; Smal, Ihor] Erasmus MC Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Biomed Imaging Grp Rotterdam, Dept Med Informat, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Meijering, Erik; Dzyubachyk, Oleh; Smal, Ihor] Erasmus MC Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Biomed Imaging Grp Rotterdam, Dept Radiol, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC,"Meijering, E (corresponding author), Erasmus MC Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Biomed Imaging Grp Rotterdam, Dept Med Informat, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,"Abraham, Anish V/C-3926-2016; Meijering, Erik/AAL-8143-2020; Dzyubachyk, Oleh/Y-3913-2018","Dzyubachyk, Oleh/0000-0003-1344-7189",,,,,45,1038,1209,7,161,ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0076-6879,,978-0-12-391857-4,METHOD ENZYMOL,Methods Enzymol.,,2012,504,,,,,,183,200,,10.1016/B978-0-12-391857-4.00009-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-391857-4.00009-4,,,18,Biochemical Research Methods; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Book Citation Index  Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,BAD98,22264535,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000303896400009,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is an extensive literature on laboratory behavioral assays, with many chemicals impairing feeding or predator avoidance. However, there is not extensive work on fishes that live in contaminated environments. Therefore, we then review our recent research on feeding and trophic relations of populations from contaminated estuaries compared with relatively unpolluted sites. The mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus, is a non-migratory fish; those from more contaminated areas are poor predators and slower to capture active prey (grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio). In the field, they consume much detritus and sediment, which is not nutritious. They are less active than fish from cleaner sites and more vulnerable to predation. They have altered thyroid glands and neurotransmitter levels, which may underlie altered behaviors. Fish from the reference site kept in tanks with sediment and food from the polluted site showed bioaccumulation and reduced prey capture after two months, although fish from the polluted site did not show significant improvement when maintained in a clean environment. Poor nutrition and predator avoidance may be responsible for their being smaller and having a shorter life span than reference fish. Bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix, are a marine species in which the young-of-the-year spend their first summer in estuaries. We found bioaccumulation of contaminants and reduced activity, schooling, and feeding in young-of-the-year bluefish from a relatively unpolluted site that were fed prey fish from a contaminated site. They also had altered thyroid glands and neurotransmitter levels. Many field-caught specimens had empty stomachs, which is rare in this species. In the fall, when they migrate back out to the ocean, they are smaller, slower, and more likely to starve or to be eaten than those that spent their summer in cleaner estuaries [Current Zoology 58 (1): 9-20, 2012].","[Weis, Judith S.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Candelmo, Allison] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, James Howard Lab, Highlands, NJ 07732 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Newark; Rutgers University New Brunswick; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA),"Weis, JS (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",jweis@andromeda.rutgers.edu,,,NJ Sea Grant Program; NOAA; Rutgers University Marine Field Station (RUMFS); Meadowlands Environmental Research Institute (MERI),NJ Sea Grant Program; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Rutgers University Marine Field Station (RUMFS); Meadowlands Environmental Research Institute (MERI),"We appreciate the assistance of numerous undergraduate students and of the staff at the James Howard NOAA Laboratory at Sandy Hook New Jersey.

All five of these species show reduced activity and feeding, but only fishes show reduced growth. In these areas, killifish are poor predators, eat much detritus, have poor predator avoidance, and are smaller and less abundant. Bluefish have reduced rates of feeding and growth. Both killifish and bluefish have altered thy mid glands and neurotransmitters, which may underlie behavioral changes. Shrimp in contaminated environments show unchanged levels of predator avoidance; compensatory energetic partitioning favors growth and reproduction despite reduced feeding. With less predation pressure, shrimp are larger and more numerous. Fiddler crabs tend to spend more time in burrows and experience reduced predation. With ample food, metal depuration through molting, and reduced population size, they grow larger. In contaminated estuaries, we've found that juvenile blue crabs are less likely to be eaten by adults; adults are impaired in prey capture but are larger, despite eating much detritus and algae. Release from top-down effects from humans-as a result of a fishery advisory-may allow crabs to live longer. It appears that differences in physiology and trophic interactions modify the effects of reduced feeding On the different species.","[Weis, Judith S.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Bergey, Lauren] Centenary Coll, Dept Sci & Math, Hackettstown, NJ USA; [Reichmuth, Jessica] Augusta State Coll, Dept Biol, Augusta, GA USA; [Candelmo, Allison] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Highlands, NJ USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Newark; University System of Georgia; Augusta University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA),"Weis, JS (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",jweis@andromeda.rutgers.edu,,,NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration); Meadowlands Environmental Research Institute; Rutgers University Marine Field Station,NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Meadowlands Environmental Research Institute; Rutgers University Marine Field Station,"We appreciate the financial support of NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), the Meadowlands Environmental Research Institute, and Rutgers University Marine Field Station; the technical support of innumerable undergraduate students; the statistical assistance of Terry Glover; and the analytical support of the laboratory of Peddrick Weis.",,59,25,38,1,61,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0006-3568,1525-3244,,BIOSCIENCE,Bioscience,MAY,2011,61,5,,,,,375,385,,10.1525/bio.2011.61.5.6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/bio.2011.61.5.6,,,11,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,763KM,,Bronze,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000290555200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is especially true for those researchers without a formal background in information theory. Here, we highlight a number of practical obstacles to model averaging complex models. Although not meant to be an exhaustive review, we identify several important issues with tentative solutions where they exist (e.g. dealing with collinearity amongst predictors; how to compute model-averaged parameters) and highlight areas for future research where solutions are not clear (e.g. when to use random intercepts or slopes; which information criteria to use when random factors are involved). We also provide a worked example of a mixed model analysis of inbreeding depression in a wild population. By providing an overview of these issues, we hope that this approach will become more accessible to those investigating any process where multiple variables impact an evolutionary or ecological response.","[Grueber, C.

Investigators have used RFID technology to examine questions related to pair formation, feeding rates, incubation behavior, prospecting behavior by nonbreeding birds, temporal changes in body condition, postfledging movements, dispersal, homing behavior, and other areas of ornithological interest. This technology can enable researchers to explore novel areas of inquiry and gather previously unobtainable quantities of information, allowing birds to record their own behavior without repeated capture and handling. In addition, RFID technology can be linked with other instruments, such as automated weighing devices, video cameras, infrared beams to detect the direction of movement, and temperature loggers, to collect additional data. New, inexpensive RFID technology has removed cost as a major constraint to the wider implementation of RFID in ornithological research. Because the technology requires that focal individuals come near (< 10 cm) a reading antenna, RFID is not appropriate for all study systems and research questions. However, integrating RFID technology with additional instrumentation platforms and external data sets will continue to revolutionize studies of avian biology and behavior.","[Bonter, David N.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Bridge, Eli S.] Univ Oklahoma, Ctr Spatial Anal, Norman, OK 73019 USA",Cornell University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Bonter, DN (corresponding author), Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",dnb23@cornell.edu,"Bridge, Eli/AAN-1928-2020; Bonter, David/H-1313-2013","Bonter, David/0000-0003-1768-1941; Bridge, Eli/0000-0003-3453-2008",Cornell Lab of Ornithology; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems; Direct For Biological Sciences [0919528] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Cornell Lab of Ornithology; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS)),"We thank B.

Because behaviour mediates interactions between an individual and its environment, the ability of organisms to behave appropriately under these new conditions is crucial for determining their immediate success or failure in these modified environments. While hundreds of species are suffering dramatically from these environmental changes, others, such as urbanized and pest species, are doing better than ever. Our goal is to provide insights into explaining such variation. We first summarize the responses of some species to novel situations, including novel risks and resources, habitat loss/fragmentation, pollutants and climate change. Using a sensory ecology approach, we present a mechanistic framework for predicting variation in behavioural responses to environmental change, drawing from models of decision-making processes and an understanding of the selective background against which they evolved. Where immediate behavioural responses are inadequate, learning or evolutionary adaptation may prove useful, although these mechanisms are also constrained by evolutionary history. Although predicting the responses of species to environmental change is difficult, we highlight the need for a better understanding of the role of evolutionary history in shaping individuals' responses to their environment and provide suggestion for future work.","[Sih, Andrew; Ferrari, Maud C.

Here, we provide, using recent examples from the behavioural ecology literature, a simple introductory guide to AIC: what it is, how and when to apply it and what it achieves.

Surprisingly, two important dimensions of the POLS concept have been neglected: (i) despite increasing evidence for numerous connections between behavioural, physiological and life-history traits, behaviours have rarely been considered in the POLS yet; (ii) the POLS could easily be applied to the study of covariation among traits between individuals within a population. In this paper, we propose that consistent behavioural differences among individuals, or personality, covary with life history and physiological differences at the within-population, interpopulation and interspecific levels.

Such effects should affect individuals and, in turn, alter interspecific interactions. We sought to determine how sublethal concentrations (0.1 and 1.0 mg/L) of two common pesticides (carbaryl and malathion) affected predator and prey behavior as well as subsequent predation rates. We conducted a series of experiments using three species of larval amphibians (Gray Treefrogs, Hyla versicolor; Green Frogs, Rana clamitans; and American Bullfrogs, R. catesbeiana) and three species of their predators (larval dragonflies, Anax Junius; adult water bugs, Belostoma flumineum; and adult Red-spotted Newts, Notophthalmus viridescens). We found that the pesticides frequently reduced the activity of all three tadpole species. For the two invertebrate predators (Anax and Belostoma), the pesticides were lethal, precluding us from examining sublethal effects on predator-prey interactions. However, newt survival was high and the addition of the pesticides reduced the predation rates of newts in one of the three tadpole species. There were no effects of the pesticides on the striking frequency of the newts or on their prey capture efficiency. Thus, the mechanism underlying the pesticide-induced reduction in predation rates remains unclear. What is clear is that sublethal concentrations of pesticides have the potential to alter prey behavior and species interactions and thereby alter the composition of ecological communities.","[Relyea, Rick A.; Edwards, Kerry] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",relyea@pitt.edu,,,REU,REU,"Our thanks to D.

It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.","[Nakagawa, Shinichi] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Schielzeth, Holger] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany; [Schielzeth, Holger] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Evolutionary Biol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden",University of Otago; Max Planck Society; Uppsala University,"Nakagawa, S (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, 340 Great King St, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",shinichi.nakagawa@otago.ac.nz; holger.schielzeth@ebc.uu.se,"Nakagawa, Shinichi/B-5571-2011; Javed, Nasir/C-2501-2012; Schielzeth, Holger/F-1419-2011","Nakagawa, Shinichi/0000-0002-7765-5182; Javed, Nasir/0000-0002-6390-431X; Schielzeth, Holger/0000-0002-9124-2261",New Zealand Marsden Fund,New Zealand Marsden Fund(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)),"We especially thank Josep Carrasco and Jarrod Hadfield who answered many questions we had during the preparation of this manuscript especially about non-Gaussian repeatability.

We discuss evidence for the hypothesis that CIDs in energy metabolism, as reflected by resting metabolic rate (RMR), promote CIDs in behavior patterns that either provide net energy (e.g. foraging activity), and/or consume energy (e.g. courtship activity). In doing so, we provide a framework for linking together RMR, behavior, and life-history productivity. Empirical studies suggest that RMR is (a) related to the capacity to generate energy, (b) repeatable, and (c) correlated with behavioral output (e.g. aggressiveness) and productivity (e.g. growth). We conclude by discussing future research directions to clarify linkages between behavior and energy metabolism in this emerging research area.","[Biro, Peter A.] Univ New S Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Stamps, Judy A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Biro, PA (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",peter.biro@unsw.edu.au; jastamps@ucdavis.edu,"Stamps, Judy A/A-5142-2010; Biro, Peter A/D-4327-2009","Biro, Peter/0000-0002-3565-240X",,,,,88,587,676,6,277,ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0169-5347,,,TRENDS ECOL EVOL,Trends Ecol.

New approaches in biological and computational sciences may be able to generate mechanistic information that could help in meeting these challenges. However, to use mechanistic data to support chemical assessments, there is a need for effective translation of this information into endpoints meaningful to ecological risk-effects on survival, development, and reproduction in individual organisms and, by extension, impacts on populations. Here we discuss a framework designed for this purpose, the adverse outcome pathway (AOP). An AOP is a conceptual construct that portrays existing knowledge concerning the linkage between a direct molecular initiating event and an adverse outcome at a biological level of organization relevant to risk assessment. The practical utility of AOPs for ecological risk assessment of chemicals is illustrated using five case examples. The examples demonstrate how the AOP concept can focus toxicity testing in terms of species and endpoint selection, enhance across-chemical extrapolation, and support prediction of mixture effects. The examples also show how AOPs facilitate use of molecular or biochemical endpoints (sometimes referred to as biomarkers) for forecasting chemical impacts on individuals and populations. In the concluding sections of the paper, we discuss how AOPs can help to guide research that supports chemical risk assessments and advocate for the incorporation of this approach into a broader systems biology framework.

How should this complex variation be studied?

Efforts to understand the links between evolutionary and ecological dynamics hinge on our ability to measure and understand how genes influence phenotypes, fitness and population dynamics. Quantitative genetics provides a range of theoretical and empirical tools with which to achieve this when the relatedness between individuals within a population is known. 2. A number of recent studies have used a type of mixed-effects model, known as the animal model, to estimate the genetic component of phenotypic variation using data collected in the field. Here, we provide a practical guide for ecologists interested in exploring the potential to apply this quantitative genetic method in their research. 3. We begin by outlining, in simple terms, key concepts in quantitative genetics and how an animal model estimates relevant quantitative genetic parameters, such as heritabilities or genetic correlations. 4. We then provide three detailed example tutorials, for implementation in a variety of software packages, for some basic applications of the animal model. We discuss several important statistical issues relating to best practice when fitting different kinds of mixed models. 5.

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.","[Bolker, Benjamin M.; Brooks, Mollie E.; Clark, Connie J.; Poulsen, John R.; White, Jada-Simone S.] Univ Florida, Dept Bot & Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Geange, Shane W.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Stevens, M.

Personality will introduce variability in resting MR measures because individuals consistently differ in their stress response, exploration or activity levels, all of which influence MR measurements made with respirometry and the doubly-labelled water technique. Physiologists try to exclude these behavioural influences from resting MR measurements, but animal personality research indicates that these attempts are unlikely to be successful. For example, because reactive animals freeze when submitted to a stress, their MR could be classified as resting because of immobility when in fact they are highly stressed with an elevated MR. More importantly, recent research demonstrating that behavioural responses to novel and highly artificial stimuli are correlated with both behaviour and fitness under more natural circumstances calls into question the wisdom of excluding these behavioural influences on MR measurements. The reason that intra-specific variation in resting MR are so weakly correlated with daily energy expenditure (DEE) and fitness, may be that the latter two measures fully incorporate personality while the former partially excludes its influence. Because activity, exploration, boldness and aggressiveness are energetically costly, personality and metabolism should be correlated and physiological constraints may underlie behavioural syndromes. We show how physiological ecologists can better examine behavioural linkages between personality and metabolism, as required to better understand the physiological correlates of personality and the evolutionary consequences of metabolic variability.","[Careau, V.; Thomas, D.] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Humphries, M.

In many species of freshwater fish, social recognition is known to be based primarily on chemical cues. Such recognition mechanisms are vulnerable to disruption by the presence of anthropogenic contaminants in the aquatic environment. Here we show that acute exposure to low, environmentally relevant dosages of the ubiquitous contaminant, 4-nonylphenol, can seriously affect social recognition and ultimately social organization in fishes. A 1 hour 0.5 mu g l(-1) dose was sufficient to alter the response of members of a shoaling fish species (juvenile banded killifish, Fundulus diaphanus) to conspecific chemical cues. Dosages of 1-2 mu g l(-1) caused killifish to orient away from dosed conspecifics, in both a flow channel and an arena. Given the overall importance of shoaling as an adaptive strategy against predators and for locating food, it is likely that its disruption by anthropogenic contaminants would have serious implications for fishes' fitness.","[Ward, Ashley J.

In this experimental study, we show collective decision-making by mixed groups of cockroaches and socially integrated autonomous robots, leading to shared shelter selection. Individuals, natural or artificial, are perceived as equivalent, and the collective decision emerges from nonlinear feedbacks based on local interactions. Even when in the minority, robots can modulate the collective decision-making process and produce a global pattern not observed in their absence.

This common phenomenon covers numerous traits, such as aggressiveness, avoidance of novelty, willingness to take risks, exploration, and sociality. The study of temperament is central to animal psychology, behavioural genetics, pharmacology, and animal husbandry, but relatively few studies have examined the ecology and evolution of temperament traits. This situation is surprising, given that temperament is likely to exert an important influence on many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, and that individual variation in temperament appears to be pervasive amongst animal species. Possible explanations for this neglect of temperament include a perceived irrelevance, an insufficient understanding of the link between temperament traits and fitness, and a lack of coherence in terminology with similar traits often given different names, or different traits given the same name. We propose that temperament can and should be studied within an evolutionary ecology framework and provide a terminology that could be used as a working tool for ecological studies of temperament. Our terminology includes five major temperament trait categories: shyness-boldness, exploration-avoidance, activity, sociability and aggressiveness. This terminology does not make inferences regarding underlying dispositions or psychological processes, which may have restrained ecologists and evolutionary biologists from working on these traits. We present extensive literature reviews that demonstrate that temperament traits are heritable, and linked to fitness and to several other traits of importance to ecology and evolution. Furthermore, we describe ecologically relevant measurement methods and point to several ecological and evolutionary topics that would benefit from considering temperament, such as phenotypic plasticity, conservation biology, population sampling, and invasion biology.","Univ Quebec, Canada Res Chair Behav Ecol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; Univ Quebec, Grp Rech Ecol Comportementale & Anim, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands; Helmholtz Eye Dis Res Inst, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands; McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CREAF, Ctr Ecol Res & Appl Forestries, E-08193 Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain; Univ Groningen, Ctr Behav & Neurosci, Anim Ecol Grp, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Utrecht University; McGill University; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF-CERCA); Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Groningen,"Réale, D (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Canada Res Chair Behav Ecol, CP 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",reale.denis@uqam.ca,"Dingemanse, Niels/ABE-6880-2020; Sol, Daniel/A-5238-2008; REALE, Denis/AAG-1571-2020; Reader, Simon M/B-9075-2011","Dingemanse, Niels/0000-0003-3320-0861; Sol, Daniel/0000-0001-6346-6949; REALE, Denis/0000-0002-0419-7125; Reader, Simon/0000-0002-3785-1357",,,,,229,2391,2690,29,1328,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1464-7931,1469-185X,,BIOL REV,Biol.

We focused on the combined effects of food limitation, drying conditions, and exposure to possibly the most abundant and widely used herbicide in the world, atrazine. We used a factorial design to evaluate the effects of exposure to four ecologically relevant doses of atrazine (approximate measured doses: 0, 4, 40, and 400 mug/L), two food levels (limited and unlimited food), and two hydroperiods (presence or absence of a dry down) on the survival, life history, and behavior of the streamside salamander, Ambystoma barbouri, from the embryo stage through metamorphosis. In general, food and atrazine levels did not interact statistically, and atrazine affected dependent variables in a standard, dose-dependent manner. Exposure to 400 mug/L of atrazine decreased embryo survival and increased time to hatching. Drying conditions and food limitation decreased larval survival, while 400 mug/L of atrazine only reduced larval survival in one of the two years tested, Suggesting that the lethality of atrazine may be condition dependent. Sublethal effects included elevated activity and reduced shelter use associated with increasing concentrations of atrazine and food limitation. The larval period was lengthened by food limitation and shortened by 400 mug/L of atrazine. Drying conditions accelerated metamorphosis for larvae exposed to 0 and 4 mug/L of atrazine but did not affect timing of metamorphosis for larvae exposed to 40 or 400 mug/L of atrazine. Food limitation, drying conditions, and 400 mug/L of atrazine reduced size at metamorphosis without affecting body condition (relationship between mass and length), even though feeding rates did not differ significantly among atrazine concentrations at any time during development. This suggests that high atrazine levels may have increased larval energy expenditures. Because smaller size at metamorphosis can lower terrestrial survival and lifetime reproduction, resource limitations, drying conditions, and environmentally realistic concentrations of atrazine have the potential to contribute to amphibian declines in impacted systems.","Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",University of Kentucky,"Rohr, JR (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, 101 TH Morgan Bldg, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",jrohr@uky.edu,"Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021; Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","ELSKUS, ADRIA/0000-0003-1192-5124; McCarthy, Thomas/0000-0003-0243-5350; Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",,,,,58,104,130,2,71,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

An example is an aggression syndrome where some individuals are more aggressive, whereas others are less aggressive across a range of situations and contexts. The existence of behavioral syndromes focuses the attention of behavioral ecologists on limited (less than optimal) behavioral plasticity and behavioral carryovers across situations, rather than on optimal plasticity in each isolated situation. Behavioral syndromes can explain behaviors that appear strikingly non-adaptive in an isolated context (e.g. inappropriately high activity when predators are present, or excessive sexual cannibalism). Behavioral syndromes can also help to explain the maintenance of individual variation in behavioral types, a phenomenon that is ubiquitous, but often ignored. Recent studies suggest that the behavioral type of an individual, population or species can have important ecological and evolutionary implications, including major effects on species distributions, on the relative tendencies of species to be invasive or to respond well to environmental change, and on speciation rates. Although most studies of behavioral syndromes to date have focused on a few organisms, mainly in the laboratory, further work on other species, particularly in the field, should yield numerous new insights.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Glasgow, Dept Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; Univ Toronto, Div Life Sci, Scarborough, ON M1C 1A4, Canada",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Glasgow; University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough,"Sih, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",asih@ucdavis.edu,"Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",,,,,80,2352,2670,20,1085,ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0169-5347,1872-8383,,TRENDS ECOL EVOL,Trends Ecol.

This is very compact (19x30x41 mm3), has many sensors (12 IR proximity, linear camera and temperature) and is able to interact with gregarious cockroaches.","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Autonomous Syst Lab, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Colot, A (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Autonomous Syst Lab, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",alexandre.colot@epfl.ch; gilles.caprari@epfl.ch; roland.siegwart@epfl.ch,"Siegwart, Roland/A-4495-2008","Siegwart, Roland/0000-0002-2760-7983",,,,,15,24,24,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1050-4729,2577-087X,0-7803-8232-3,IEEE INT CONF ROBOT,,,2004,,,,,,,2418,2423,,10.1109/ROBOT.2004.1307423,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2004.1307423,,,6,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Robotics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Robotics,BAE24,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000221794800390,View Full Record in Web of Science

Pesticides may play a role in these declines, but pesticide concentrations in nature often are low and considered sublethal. Past research has found that the globally common pesticide carbaryl can become more lethal under different environmental conditions including differences in temperature and competition. A recent study has found, that predatory stress, a situation common for most amphibians, can make carbaryl 2-4 times more deadly to gray tree frogs (Hyla versicolor). To determine whether this is a general phenomenon in amphibians, I examined how carbaryl affected the survival of six amphibian species in the presence and absence of predatory stress. Higher concentrations of carbaryl caused higher mortality. In two of the six species, carbaryl became even more lethal when combined with predatory stress (up to 46 times more lethal). This suggests that apparently safe concentrations of carbaryl (and perhaps other pesticides with similar modes of action) can become more deadly to some amphibian species when combined with predator cues.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",,,,,,,,45,212,260,2,95,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

The system takes an analog video signal, digitizes each frame, and analyses the resultant pixels to determine the location of the tracked animals (as well as other data). Calculations are performed on a series of frames to derive a set of quantitative descriptors of the animal's movement. EthoVision (from Noldus Information Technology) is a specific example of such a system, and its functionality that is particularly relevant to transgenic mice studies is described. Key practical aspects of using the EthoVision system are also outlined, including tips about lighting, marking animals, the arena size, and sample rate. Four case studies are presented, illustrating various aspects of the system: (1) The effects of disabling the Munc 18-1 gene were clearly shown using the straightforward measure of how long the mice took to enter a zone in an open field. (2) Differences in exploratory behavior between short and long attack latency mice strains were quantified by measuring the time spent in inner and outer zones of an open field. (3) Mice with hypomorphic CREB alleles were shown to perform less well in a water maze, but this was only clear when a range of different variables were calculated from their tracks. (4) Mice with the trkB receptor knocked out in the forebrain also performed poorly in a water maze, and it was immediately apparent from examining plots of the tracks that this was due to thigmotaxis. Some of the latest technological developments and possible future directions for video tracking systems are briefly discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Initial studies were conducted to determine the effect of soil moisture and depth oil the rate of larval movement. Movement of 2-d-old larvae in sandy soil was not affected by soil moisture ranging from 2 to 12%, but they did not penetrate soil with < 1% moisture. Movement of 2-d-old larvae was retarded as moisture and soil depth increased. Newly hatched larvae exhibited poor vertical movement, suggesting that larval age is an important factor to consider in experimentation. In all bioassays, soil application of either M. anisopliae or B. bassiana at 5 x 10(3), 5 x 10(4), and 5 x 10(5) conidia per gram of soil as an oil or wettable powder formulation had no effect on the movement of larvae of D. abbreviatus in soil at different moistures. The addition of imidacloprid to the soil at doses of 5 mu g/g soil or greater significantly impaired larval movement. When the chemical was applied with a fungus, however, larval movement was more severely impaired. Soil treatment with unformulated conidia of M. anisopliae and B. bassiana as wettable powder at 5 x 10(3), 5 x 10(4), and 5 x 10(5) caused minimal larval mortality of D. abbreviatus. In fact. larval mycosis (10.2%) was found only for the B. bassiana oil formulation at 5 x 10(5) conidia per gram soil. When sublethal doses of imidacloprid were combined with conidia of either fungus and applied to the soil, both larval mortality and mycosis increased synergistically. When M. anlsopliae at 5 x 10(5) conidia per gram soil were applied alone or in combination with imidacloprid at 25 mu g/g of soil, larval mortality, and mycosis decreased as soil moisture increased from < 1 to 14%.","Univ Florida, Ctr Citrus Res & Educ, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Quintela, ED (corresponding author), CNPAF, Empresa Brasileira Pesquisa Agropecuaria, Cx P179, BR-74001970 Goiania, Go, Brazil.",,"QUINTELA, ELIANE/ABI-7777-2020",/0000-0001-9412-4845,,,,,32,107,134,0,27,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0022-0493,,,J ECON ENTOMOL,J.
