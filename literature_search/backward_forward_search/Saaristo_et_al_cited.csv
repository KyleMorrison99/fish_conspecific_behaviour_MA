New approaches in biological and computational sciences may be able to generate mechanistic information that could help in meeting these challenges. However, to use mechanistic data to support chemical assessments, there is a need for effective translation of this information into endpoints meaningful to ecological risk-effects on survival, development, and reproduction in individual organisms and, by extension, impacts on populations. Here we discuss a framework designed for this purpose, the adverse outcome pathway (AOP). An AOP is a conceptual construct that portrays existing knowledge concerning the linkage between a direct molecular initiating event and an adverse outcome at a biological level of organization relevant to risk assessment. The practical utility of AOPs for ecological risk assessment of chemicals is illustrated using five case examples. The examples demonstrate how the AOP concept can focus toxicity testing in terms of species and endpoint selection, enhance across-chemical extrapolation, and support prediction of mixture effects. The examples also show how AOPs facilitate use of molecular or biochemical endpoints (sometimes referred to as biomarkers) for forecasting chemical impacts on individuals and populations. In the concluding sections of the paper, we discuss how AOPs can help to guide research that supports chemical risk assessments and advocate for the incorporation of this approach into a broader systems biology framework.

Numerous studies on active avoidance and drift by aquatic organisms, as well as the main approaches used to measure both responses, were reviewed. We put forward a particular recommendation regarding methodological approaches: active avoidance should preferably be evaluated under a dilution gradient in a multi-compartmented system instead of in a bi-compartmented system. Available data on spatial avoidance from contamination indicate that emigration can occur at even lower contaminant concentrations than sub-individual noxious effects (assessed with the traditional forced-exposure assays), challenging the widely accepted paradigm in ecotoxicology that contaminant-driven adverse consequences at the population level result from a time delayed cascade of sequentially linked biochemical, cellular, physiological, and finally whole organism deleterious effects. Therefore, contaminants should not be viewed solely as potential toxicants at the individual level, but also as potential disturbers of habitats, by making the latter, at least partially, unsuited to accommodate life. Also, exposure to contamination is needed to trigger avoidance, but uptake is not mandatory, which demands the concept of exposure to be expanded, to include also the mere perception of the stressor. Since emigration eventually leads to local population extinction, and thus to severe implications for ecosystem structure and functioning, we then recommend that avoidance data be incorporated in environmental risk assessment schemes.

Recent studies have revealed pharmaceutical residues in a wide range of ecosystems and organisms. Environmental concentrations are often low, but pharmaceuticals typically are designed to have biological effects at low doses, acting on physiological systems that can be evolutionarily conserved across taxa. This Theme Issue introduces the latest research investigating the risks of environmentally relevant concentrations of pharmaceuticals to vertebrate wildlife. We take a holistic, global view of environmental exposure to pharmaceuticals encompassing terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems in high- and low-income countries. Based on both field and laboratory data, the evidence for and relevance of changes to physiology and behaviour, in addition to mortality and reproductive effects, are examined in terms of the population- and community-level consequences of pharmaceutical exposure on wildlife. Studies on uptake, trophic transfer and indirect effects of pharmaceuticals acting via food webs are presented. Given the logistical and ethical complexities of research in this area, several papers focus on techniques for prioritizing which compounds are most likely to harm wildlife and how modelling approaches can make predictions about the bioavailability, metabolism and toxicity of pharmaceuticals in non-target species. This Theme Issue aims to help clarify the uncertainties, highlight opportunities and inform ongoing scientific and policy debates on the impacts of pharmaceuticals in the environment.","[Arnold, Kathryn E.] Univ York, Dept Environm, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Brown, A.

The resultant exposure to human pharmaceuticals remains poorly studied for terrestrial species. On the basis of predicted exposure levels in the wild, we administered the common antidepressant fluoxetine (FLUOX) or control treatment via prey to wild-caught starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) for 22 weeks over winter. To investigate responses to fluoxetine, birds were moved from their group aviaries into individual cages for 2 days. Boldness, exploration and activity levels showed no treatment effects but controls and FLUOX birds habituated differently to isolation in terms of the concentration of corticosterone (CORT) metabolites in faeces. The controls that excreted higher concentrations of CORT metabolites on day 1 lost more body mass by day 2 of isolation than those which excreted lower levels of CORT metabolites. CORT metabolites and mass loss were unrelated in FLUOX birds. When we investigated the movements of birds in their group aviaries, we found the controls made a higher frequency of visits to food trays than FLUOX birds around the important foraging periods of sunrise and sunset, as is optimal for wintering birds. Although individual variability makes interpreting the sub-lethal endpoints measured challenging, our data suggest that fluoxetine at environmentally relevant concentrations can significantly alter behaviour and physiology.","[Bean, Tom G.; Boxall, Alistair B.

One class of chemical pollutant threatening ecosystems globally is the endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The capacity of EDCs to disrupt development and reproduction is well established, but their effects on behaviour have received far less attention. Here, we investigate the impact of a widespread androgenic EDC on reproductive behaviour in the guppy, Poecilia reticulate. We found that short-term exposure of male guppies to an environmentally relevant concentration of 17 beta-trenbolone a common environmental pollutant associated with livestock production influenced the amount of male courtship and forced copulatory behaviour (sneaking) performed toward females, as well as the receptivity of females toward exposed males. Exposure to 17 beta-trenbolone was also associated with greater male mass. However, no effect of female exposure to 17 beta-trenbolone was detected on female reproductive behaviour, indicating sex-specific vulnerability at this dosage. Our study is the first to show altered male reproductive behaviour following exposure to an environmentally realistic concentration of 17 beta-trenbolone, demonstrating the possibility of widespread disruption of mating systems of aquatic organisms by common agricultural contaminants.

However, theoretical studies generally focus on the probability of fixation of alleles or the mean fitness of populations, rather than local adaptation as it is commonly measured experimentally or in field studies. Here, we develop mathematical models and use them to generate analytical predictions for the level of local adaptation as a function of selection, migration and genetic drift. First, we contrast mean fitness and local adaptation measures and show that the latter can be expressed in a simple and general way as a function of the spatial covariance between population mean phenotype and local environmental conditions. Second, we develop several approximations of a population genetics model to show that the system exhibits different behaviours depending on the rate of migration. The main insights are the following: with intermediate migration, both genetic drift and migration decrease local adaptation; with low migration, drift decreases local adaptation but migration speeds up adaptation; with high migration, genetic drift has no effect on local adaptation. Third, we extend this analysis to cases where the trait under selection is continuous using classical quantitative genetics theory. Finally, we discuss these results in the light of recent experimental work on local adaptation.","[Blanquart, F.; Gandon, S.] Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Nuismer, S.

Several ecotoxicological studies have been done, but generally, little is known about the ecological effects of pharmaceuticals. Here we show that a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug (oxazepam) alters behavior and feeding rate of wild European perch (Perca fluviatilis) at concentrations encountered in effluent-influenced surface waters. Individuals exposed to water with dilute drug concentrations (1.8 micrograms liter(-1)) exhibited increased activity, reduced sociality, and higher feeding rate.

A complex mix of pharmaceuticals enters waterways via treated wastewater effluent and many remain biochemically active after the drugs reach aquatic systems. However, to date little is known regarding the ecological effects that might arise following pharmaceutical contamination of aquatic environments. One group of particular concern is behaviorally modifying pharmaceuticals as seemingly minor changes in behavior may initiate marked ecological consequences. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug (oxazepam) on key behavioral traits in wild roach (Rutilus rutilus) at concentrations similar to those encountered in effluent surface waters. Roach exposed to water with high concentrations of oxazepam (280 mu g/L) exhibited increased boldness, while roach at low treatment (0.84 mu g/L) became bolder and more active compared to control fish. Our results reinforce the notion that anxiolytic drugs may be affecting fish behavior in natural systems, emphasizing the need for further research on ecological impacts of pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems and development of new tools to incorporate ecologically relevant behavioral endpoints into ecotoxicological risk assessment.","[Brodin, Tomas; Nordling, Johanna; Lagesson, Annelie; Klaminder, Jonatan; Christensen, Bent] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Hellstrom, Gustav] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, Umea, Sweden; [Fick, Jerker] Umea Univ, Dept Chem, Umea, Sweden",Umea University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Umea University,"Brodin, T (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",tomas.brodin@umu.se,"Berglund Fick, Jerker/HDO-5788-2022","Brodin, Tomas/0000-0003-1086-7567",Swedish Research Council Formas [2013-4431],Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),This study was supported by a grant from the Swedish Research Council Formas (2013-4431) to Tomas Brodin.,,37,42,45,6,66,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1528-7394,1087-2620,,J TOXICOL ENV HEAL A,J.

Here, we synthesize the available knowledge on drug-induced behavioural alterations in fish, discuss potential ecological consequences and report results from an experiment in which we quantify both uptake and behavioural impact of a psychiatric drug on a predatory fish (Perca fluviatilis) and its invertebrate prey (Coenagrion hastulatum). We show that perch became more active while damselfly behaviour was unaffected, illustrating that behavioural effects of pharmaceuticals can differ between species. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prey consumption can be an important exposure route as on average 46% of the pharmaceutical in ingested prey accumulated in the predator. This suggests that investigations of exposure through bioconcentration, where trophic interactions and subsequent bioaccumulation of exposed individuals are ignored, underestimate exposure. Wildlife may therefore be exposed to higher levels of behaviourally altering pharmaceuticals than predictions based on commonly used exposure assays and pharmaceutical concentrations found in environmental monitoring programmes.","[Brodin, Tomas; Klaminder, Jonatan; Heynen, Martina; Jonsson, Micael] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Fick, Jerker] Umea Univ, Dept Chem, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Piovano, Susanna] Univ S Pacific, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, Suva, Fiji; [Piovano, Susanna] Univ Turin, Dept Life Sci & Syst Biol, I-10124 Turin, Italy",Umea University; Umea University; University of the South Pacific; University of Turin,"Brodin, T (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",tomas.brodin@emg.umu.se,"Berglund Fick, Jerker/HDO-5788-2022; Jonsson, Micael/E-6839-2012","Fick, Jerker/0000-0002-3949-7371; Brodin, Tomas/0000-0003-1086-7567",Swedish Research Councils Formas; Vetenskapsradet; C.M.

For practical reasons, extrapolation of pharmaceutical effects from 'model' species to other fish species is adopted in risk assessment. Here, we critically assess this approach. First, we show that between 65% and 86% of human drug targets are evolutionarily conserved in 12 diverse fish species. Focusing on nuclear steroid hormone receptors, we further show that the sequence of the ligand binding domain that plays a key role in drug potency is highly conserved, but there is variation between species. This variation for the oestrogen receptor, however, does not obviously account for observed differences in receptor activation. Taking the synthetic oestrogen ethinyloestradiol as a test case, and using life-table-response experiments, we demonstrate significant reductions in population growth in fathead minnow and medaka, but not zebrafish, for environmentally relevant exposures. This finding contrasts with zebrafish being ranked as more ecologically susceptible, according to two independent life-history analyses. We conclude that while most drug targets are conserved in fish, evolutionary divergence in drug-target activation, physiology, behaviour and ecological life history make it difficult to predict population-level effects. This justifies the conventional use of at least a 10x assessment factor in pharmaceutical risk assessment, to account for differences in species susceptibility.","[Brown, A.

The 1 x OE-spiked sediment contained concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyis similar to those in field-collected sediment. Exposure to this sediment, but not to the B[a]P-spiked sediment, significantly increased embryo-larval mortality and prevalence of spinal deformities. Mutant frequency at the c// mutation target gene in the liver of 10-week-old medaka was significantly increased following exposure to either B[a]P or the three doses of OE. The predominant OE-induced liver mutations were G:C to T:A transversions, consistent with PAHs being the major contributors to the mutation induction. Liver and gonadal tumors were observed in 35-week-old medaka exposed to either B[a]P (1/25) or to the 1 x OE (1/24).

Maladaptation to the new environment initially causes the population to decline, until adaptive phenotypic plasticity and genetic evolution restore positive population growth rate. We assume that selection on a quantitative trait is density-independent and that the initial cost of plasticity is much lower than the benefit of the initial plastic response. The initial partially adaptive plasticity reduces the effective magnitude of the environmental shift, whereas evolution of plasticity increases the rate of adaptation. Both effects greatly facilitate population persistence. In contrast, density dependence of population growth always hinders persistence. With theta-logistic population regulation, a lower value of. produces a faster initial population decline and a higher extinction risk.","[Chevin, Luis-Miguel; Lande, Russell] Imperial Coll London, Div Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England",Imperial College London,"Chevin, LM (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Div Biol, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",l.chevin@imperial.ac.uk,"Chevin, Luis-Miguel/HHM-3725-2022","Chevin, Luis-Miguel/0000-0003-4188-4618",Newton International Fellowship; Royal Society of London,Newton International Fellowship; Royal Society of London(Royal Society),This work was supported by a Newton International Fellowship to L.-M.

Many aspects of animal behaviour differ consistently between individuals, giving rise to the growing field of animal personality research. While between-individual variation has long been of interest to biologists, the role of within-individual variation has received less attention. Indeed, many models assume that the extent of within-individual variation is the same across individuals despite the fact that individuals may often differ in their variability. Recently, the importance of within-individual variability or predictability has been recognized within the field of animal behaviour. However, there is a lack of a consensus on how best to quantify it. This situation, in turn, has led to the development of a variety of different methods aimed at assessing how variable or predictable different individuals are. Here, we review the indices that have been proposed as proxies of individual predictability. We then introduce existing techniques called hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLMs) and double-hierarchical generalized linear models (DHGLMs) as general tools for quantifying predictability. HGLMs and DHGLMs are extensions of random intercept mixed models that exploit the fact that variation in variances as well as variation in means can be modelled within a single overarching framework. Explicit modelling of the within-individual residual variation by (D)HGLMs makes more efficient use of the data, performs better on unbalanced data sets and captures more of the uncertainty involved in modelling within-individual variation than other proposed indices. In addition, (D)HGLMs yield an estimator of population-wide variation in predictability, which can serve as a standardized effect size for comparisons across traits and studies. We call this estimator CVP, the coefficient of variation in predictability. The different methods described here and the standardized effect size CVP should open new avenues for studying individuality in animal behaviour. Since sound understanding of individual variation is central to many studies in ecology and evolution, these methods have wide application both in the field of animal personality research and beyond.","[Cleasby, Ian R.] Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Cleasby, Ian R.] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Devon, England; [Nakagawa, Shinichi] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Schielzeth, Holger] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Evolutionary Biol, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Leeds; University of Exeter; University of Otago; University of Bielefeld,"Cleasby, IR (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",i.r.cleasby@gmail.com,"Nakagawa, Shinichi/B-5571-2011; Schielzeth, Holger/F-1419-2011","Nakagawa, Shinichi/0000-0002-7765-5182; Schielzeth, Holger/0000-0002-9124-2261","Emmy Noether fellowship from German Research Foundation (DFG) [SCHI 1188/1-1]; Rutherford Discovery Fellowship, New Zealand","Emmy Noether fellowship from German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Rutherford Discovery Fellowship, New Zealand(Royal Society of New Zealand)","We thank Yimen Araya-Ajoy, Stuart Bearhop, Tom Bodey, Alexa Cleasby, Niels Dingemanse, Dave Fisher, Keith Hamer, Barbara Morrissey, Steve Votier, Ewan Wakefield and Alastair Wilson for advice and discussion during the writing of the manuscript.

Recent discoveries that species diversity is positively associated with ecosystem stability, recovery, and services have made a community-level perspective on ecotoxicology more important than ever. Community ecotoxicology must explicitly consider both present and impending global change and shift from a purely descriptive to a more predictive science. Greater consideration of the ecological factors and threshold responses that determine community resistance and resilience should improve our ability to predict how and when communities will respond to, and recover from, xenobiotics. A better understanding of pollution-induced community tolerance, and of the costs of this tolerance, should facilitate identifying contaminant-impacted communities, thus forecasting the ecological consequences of contaminant exposure and determining the restoration effectiveness. Given the vast complexity of community ecotoxicology, simplifying assumptions, such as the possibility that the approximately 100,000 registered chemicals could be reduced to a more manageable number of contaminant classes with similar modes of action, must be identified and validated. In addition to providing a framework for predicting contaminant fate and effects, food-web ecology can help to identify communities that are sensitive to contaminants, contaminants that are particularly insidious to communities, and species that are crucial for transmitting adverse effects across trophic levels. Integration of basic ecological principles into the design and implementation of ecotoxicological research is essential for predicting contaminant effects within the context of rapidly changing, global environmental conditions.","[Clements, William H.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Rohr, Jason R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",Colorado State University; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Clements, WH (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",willc@cnr.colostate.edu,"Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021; Clements, William/N-2686-2016",,"U.

These chemicals, commonly referred to as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (hereafter EDCs), pose a particularly severe threat to animal health. They accumulate in body tissues and are highly persistent in the environment and thus can occur at significant concentrations far from their points of origin. Ecotoxicologists have used a number of animal species to identify physiological and morphological consequences of EDC exposure. Effects of exposure have typically been measured in terms of survival, development or aspects of reproductive anatomy and physiology. In recent years, ecotoxicologists have begun using behavioural endpoints as components of standard toxicological assays. There has been a concurrent although less widespread interest among animal behaviourists in understanding and studying the effects of these contaminants on animal behaviour. The purposes of this review are four-fold. First, we provide a primer on EDCs. Second, we summarize current knowledge about endocrine disruption of animal behaviour. Third, we describe the role that we envision for behaviour in the field of ecotoxicology.

Although the act of moving from one habitat to another entails major costs to the disperser, empirical and theoretical studies suggest that these costs can be reduced by having morphological, physiological or behavioural specializations for dispersal. A few recent studies on different systems showed that individuals exhibit personality-dependent dispersal, meaning that dispersal tendency is associated with boldness, sociability or aggressiveness. Indeed, in several species, dispersers not only develop behavioural differences at the onset of dispersal, but display these behavioural characteristics through their life cycle. While personality-dependent dispersal has been demonstrated in only a few species, we believe that it is a widespread phenomenon with important ecological consequences. Here, we review the evidence for behavioural differences between dispersers and residents, to what extent they constitute personalities. We also examine how a link between personality traits and dispersal behaviours can be produced and how personality-dependent dispersal affects the dynamics of metapopulations and biological invasions. Finally, we suggest future research directions for population biologists, behavioural ecologists and conservation biologists such as how the direction and the strength of the relationship between personality traits and dispersal vary with ecological contexts.","[Cote, J.; Brodin, T.; Fogarty, S.; Sih, A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Clobert, J.] CNRS Moulis, USR 2936, Stn Ecol Expt, F-09200 St Girons, France; [Brodin, T.] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden",University of California System; University of California Davis; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Umea University,"Cote, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jdcote@ucdavis.edu,"Cote, Julien/B-7809-2011; Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Cote, Julien/0000-0002-4453-5969; Brodin, Tomas/0000-0003-1086-7567; Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",Fyssen Foundation; Swedish Research Council; ANR; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems; Direct For Biological Sciences [0951232] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Fyssen Foundation; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); ANR(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS)),"This research programme has been supported by a Fyssen Foundation fellowship to J.C., by a postdoctoral fellowship grant from the Swedish Research Council to T.B. and by The ANR grant DIAME and European Biodiversa programme Tenlamas to J.C.",,96,482,562,5,326,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8436,1471-2970,,PHILOS T R SOC B,Philos.

Studies of invertebrates, fish and amphibians have shown that non-lethal effects may be larger than lethal effects in determining the behaviour, condition, density and distribution of animals over a range of trophic levels. Although non-lethal effects have been well described in the behavioural ecology of birds (and also mammals) within the context of anti-predation behaviour, their role relative to lethal effects is probably underestimated. Birds show many behavioural and physiological changes to reduce direct mortality from predation and these are likely to have negative effects on other aspects of their fitness and population dynamics, as well as affecting the ecology of their own prey and their predators. As a consequence, the effects of predation in birds are best measured by trade-offs between maximizing instantaneous survival in the presence of predators and acquiring or maintaining resources for long-term survival or reproduction. Because avoiding predation imposes foraging costs, and foraging behaviour is relatively easy to measure in birds, the foraging-predation risk trade-off is probably an effective framework for understanding the importance of non-lethal effects, and so the population and community effects of predation risk in birds and other animals. Using a trade-off approach allows us to predict better how changes in predator density will impact on population and community dynamics, and how animals perceive and respond to predation risk, when non-lethal effects decouple the relationship between predator density and direct mortality rate. The trade-off approach also allows us to identify where predation risk is structuring communities because of avoidance of predators, even when this results in no observable direct mortality rate.","Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 9TS, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"Cresswell, W (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Bute Bldg, St Andrews KY16 9TS, Fife, Scotland.",wrlc@st-and.ac.uk,"Bond, Alexander L/A-3786-2010; Cresswell, Will/B-1472-2013","Cresswell, Will/0000-0002-4684-7624",,,,,157,257,317,5,205,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0019-1019,1474-919X,,IBIS,Ibis,JAN,2008,150,1,,,,,3,17,,10.1111/j.1474-919X.2007.00793.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2007.00793.x,,,15,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,249DN,,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000252207300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The odourants L-alanine and taurocholic acid (TCA) specifically activate microvillous or ciliated OSNs, respectively, in fish. We recorded electro-olfactograms (EOG) in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas; a laboratory-reared model species) and wild yellow perch (Perca flavescens) whose olfactory chambers were perfused with either L-alanine or TCA to determine if OSN classes were differentially vulnerable to contaminants, in this case copper or nickel. Results were consistent in both species and demonstrated that nickel targeted and impaired microvillous OSN function, while copper targeted and impaired ciliated OSN function. This result suggests that contaminant-specific effects observed in model laboratory species extrapolate to wild fish populations. Moreover, fathead minnows exposed to copper failed to perceive a conspecific alarm cue in a choice maze, whereas those exposed to nickel could respond to the same conspecific cue. These results demonstrate that fathead minnows perceive conspecific, damage-released alarm cue by ciliated, but not microvillous, OSNs. Fish living in copper-contaminated environments may be more vulnerable to predation than those in clean lakes owing to targeted effects on ciliated OSNs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

How should this complex variation be studied? Here, we outline how central ideas in behavioural ecology and quantitative genetics can be combined within a single framework based on the concept of 'behavioural reaction norms'.

Lizards were exposed to carbaryl (2.5, 25, and 250 mu g/g) and were raced before and 4, 24, and 96 h after dosing. In the terrestrial setting, exposure to low concentrations of carbaryl had stimulatory effects on performance, but exposure to the highest concentration was inhibitory. No stimulatory effects of carbaryl were noted in the arboreal environment and performance in lizards was reduced after exposure to both the medium and highest dose of carbaryl. Our findings suggest that acute exposure to high concentrations of carbaryl can have important sublethal consequences on fitness-related traits in reptiles and that arboreal locomotor performance is a more sensitive indicator of AChE-inhibiting pesticide poisoning than terrestrial locomotor performance.

Sensitive species may be impaired by sublethal effects or decimated by lethality, and this ecological alteration may initiate a trophic cascade or a release from competition that secondarily leads to responses in tolerant species. Contaminants may exert direct effects on keystone facilitator and foundation species, and contaminant-induced changes in nutrient and oxygen dynamics may alter ecosystem function. Thus, populations and communities in nature may be directly and/or indirectly affected by exposure to pollutants. While the direct effects of toxicants usually reduce organism abundance, indirect effects may lead to increased or decreased abundance. Here we review 150 papers that reference indirect toxicant effects in aquatic environments. Studies of accidental contaminant release, chronic contamination and experimental manipulations have identified indirect contaminant effects in pelagic and benthic communities caused by many types of pollutants. Contaminant-induced changes in behavior, competition and predation/grazing rate can alter species abundances or community composition, and enhance, mask or spuriously indicate direct contaminant effects. Trophic cascades were found in 60% of the manipulative studies and, most commonly, primary producers increased in abundance when grazers were selectively eliminated by contaminants. Competitive release may also be common, but is difficult to distinguish from trophic cascades because few experiments are designed to isolate the mechanism(s) causing indirect effects. Indirect contaminant effects may have profound implications in environments with strong trophic cascades such as the freshwater pelagic. In spite of their undesirable environmental influence, contaminants can be useful manipulative tools for the study of trophic and competitive interactions in natural communities.

Important among these anthropogenic influences is the proliferation of organic chemicals, some of which perturb hormone systems, the latter referred to as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). EDCs are widespread in the environment and affect all levels of reproduction, including development of reproductive organs, hormone release and regulation through the life cycle, the development of secondary sexual characteristics, and the maturation and maintenance of adult physiology and behavior. However, what is not well-known is how the confluence of EDC actions on the manifestation of morphological and behavioral sexual traits influences mate choice, a process that requires the reciprocal evaluation of and/or acceptance of a sexual partner. Moreover, the outcomes of EDC-induced perturbations are likely to influence sexual selection; yet this has rarely been directly tested. Here, we provide background on the development and manifestation of sexual traits, reproductive competence, and the neurobiology of sexual behavior, and evidence for their perturbation by EDCs.

We review the effects of acute but sublethal exposure to organophosphates and carbamates on thermoregulation (hypothermia), food consumption (anorexia and altered foraging behavior), and reproduction (altered hormone levels, reductions in clutch and litter size, and alterations in reproductive behavior), and the mechanisms believed to cause them.

Our understanding of the physiological basis for these adaptations is limited, but they are likely to include processes involved with the absorption, distribution, metabolism and/or excretion of the target chemical. Other potential adaptive mechanisms include enhancements in antioxidant responses, an increased capacity for DNA and/or tissue repair and alterations to the life cycle of fish that enable earlier reproduction. Analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism frequencies has shown that tolerance to hydrocarbon pollutants in both marine and estuarine fish species involves alteration in the expression of the xenobiotic metabolism enzyme CYP1A. In this review, we present novel data showing also that variants of the CYP1A gene have been under selection in guppies living in Trinidadian rivers heavily polluted with crude oil. Potential costs associated with these adaptations could reduce fitness in unpolluted water conditions. Integrating knowledge of local adaptation to pollution is an important future consideration in conservation practices such as for successful restocking, and improving connectivity within river systems.

A few examples of studies performed since the 1960s are discussed to highlight the sensitivity of these approaches in investigating the effects of chemicals, including priority pollutants and emerging contaminants, relative to conventional toxicity tests measuring survival. The advantage of the behavioural response is due to the integration of biochemical and physiological processes that reflect changes at higher levels of organisation with ecological relevance. Avoidance often represents a behavioural symptom easily detected in many animals exposed to contaminants and would be a useful test to explore more widely. This rapid response would reflect a defence mechanism protective against further exposure and the potential development of more pronounced deleterious effects, whilst in some cases, escape could lead to the relocation of a species with negative consequences. An investigation of the avoidance behaviour of mud shrimp, Corophium volutator, along with the chemical analyses of sediments and amphipods to assess the quality of harbour sediments is summarised. The body burden of the amphipods was 1,000 times lower than the one associated with narcosis, emphasizing the sensitivity of this endpoint. The application of this acute toxicity test is briefly compared to additional work that involved intertidal mussels collected in the field. Recent research undertaken with mud snails, Ilyanassa obsoleta, and harbour sediments confirmed the usefulness of the escape behaviour as an assessment tool. However, the limits of the state of knowledge regarding the fate of contaminants in species with the ability to metabolise contaminants is further discussed along with directions to be pursued to address questions arising from the reviewed literature.","[Hellou, Jocelyne] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada; [Hellou, Jocelyne] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Chem, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Hellou, Jocelyne] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS, Canada",Bedford Institute of Oceanography; Fisheries & Oceans Canada; Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University,"Hellou, J (corresponding author), Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, POB 1006, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada.",Jocelyne.Hellou@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,"Chen, Changxi/H-4152-2011",,"Department of Fisheries and Oceans; National Science and Engineering Research Council, Canada","Department of Fisheries and Oceans; National Science and Engineering Research Council, Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","Funding for this research came from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the National Science and Engineering Research Council, Canada.

Exposing salmon smolt to a dilute concentration of a GABAA receptor agonist (oxazepam) increased migration intensity compared with untreated smolt.

Whether behaviour in captivity is analogous to behaviour in the wild, however, is seldom tested. We compared individual behaviour between captivity and the wild in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Over two winters, 125 blue tits were briefly brought into captivity to measure exploratory tendency and neophobia using variants of standard personality assays. Each was then released, fitted with a passive integrated transponder. Using an electronic monitoring system, we then recorded individuals' use of feeders as they foraged in the wild. We used variation in the discovery of new feeders to score 91 birds for exploratory tendency in the wild. At eight permanent feeding stations, 78 birds were assayed for neophobia in the wild. Behavioural variation in the captive personality trials was independent of permanent (e.g. sex) and nonpermanent (e.g. condition or weather) sources of between-individual variation at capture. Individual exploratory tendency and neophobia were consistent and repeatable in captivity, and analogous traits were repeatable in the wild; thus all constituted personality traits in the blue tit. Exploratory tendency and neophobia were not correlated with each other, in either the captive or the wild context. Therefore they are independent traits in blue tits, in contrast to many species. Finally, exploratory tendency and neophobia measured in captivity positively predicted the analogous traits measured in the wild. Reflecting differences in the use of feeding opportunities, personality in captivity therefore revealed relevant differences in foraging behaviour between individuals.

If these differences extend to pertinent natural environmental changes, which indicate changing predation or starvation threat, then personality may reflect important variation in how animals manage risk. We examined whether personality traits classified in captivity would predict the behavioral flexibility of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus as they foraged in the wild. Behavioral flexibility was defined as the tendency to adjust feeder use with changing winter air temperature, an indicator of starvation risk. At the population level, birds reduced their feeder use on warm days. Individuals, though, varied widely, with some instead using feeders at a relatively fixed, temperature-independent rate. Sex and size, correlates of dominance in blue tits, did not predict behavioral flexibility. Instead, behavioral flexibility was predicted by age and 2 personality traits: old, neophobic, and exploratory birds were more behaviorally flexible than young, neophilic, and nonexploratory birds. Our findings suggest that personality types differ in how they use information about their environments and hence cope with environmental change.A bird's response to the weather depends on their personality. Individual birds, like humans, respond differently to the same novel or threatening situations. In winter, when starvation risk is greatest, blue tits varied in foraging strategy. Shy but exploratory individuals adjusted their feeder use with air temperature, feeding most on cold days. Bold but less exploratory individuals fed at a fixed rate all winter. Thus, personality may predict how individuals cope with environmental change.","[Herborn, Katherine A.; Arnold, Kathryn E.] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Sch Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Heidinger, Britt J.] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fargo, ND 58102 USA; [Alexander, Lucille] WALTHAM Ctr Pet Nutr, Melton Mowbray LE14 4RT, England; [Arnold, Kathryn E.] Univ York, Environm Dept, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Glasgow; North Dakota State University Fargo; Mars; WALTHAM Petcare Science Institute; University of York - UK,"Herborn, KA (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Sch Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",katherine.herborn@glasgow.ac.uk,"Herborn, Katherine/Q-4412-2019; Arnold, Kathryn/F-8683-2016","Arnold, Kathryn/0000-0002-6485-6065; Herborn, Katherine/0000-0002-5913-7912",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Industrial Case studentship; WALTHAM(R) [BBS/S/M/2006/13139]; Royal Society University Research Fellowship,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Industrial Case studentship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); WALTHAM(R); Royal Society University Research Fellowship(Royal Society),K.H. was funded by a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Industrial Case studentship with WALTHAM (R) (BBS/S/M/2006/13139) and K.

Since that time, there have been numerous documented examples of adverse effects of EDCs in invertebrates, fish, wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. Hormonal systems can be disrupted by numerous different anthropogenic chemicals including antiandrogens, androgens, estrogens, AhR agonists, inhibitors of steroid hormone synthesis, antithyroid substances, and retinoid agonists. In addition, pathways and targets for endocrine disruption extend beyond the traditional estrogen/androgen/thyroid receptor-mediated reproductive and developmental systems. For example, scientists have expressed concern about the potential role of EDCs in increasing trends in early puberty in girls, obesity and type II diabetes in the United States and other populations. New concerns include complex endocrine alterations induced by mixtures of chemicals, an issue broadened due to the growing awareness that EDCs present in the environment include a variety of potent human and veterinary pharmaceutical products, personal care products, nutraceuticals and phytosterols. In this review we (1) address what have we learned about the effects of EDCs on fish, wildlife, and human health, (2) discuss representative animal studies on (anti)androgens, estrogens and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-like chemicals, and (3) evaluate regulatory proposals being considered for screening and testing these chemicals.","[Hotchkiss, Andrew K.; Rider, Cynthia V.; Blystone, Chad R.; Wilson, Vickie S.; Hartig, Phillip C.; Gray, L.

Information on the presence of pharmaceuticals in biota is still scarce, but the scientific literature on the subject has established the possibility of bioaccumulation in exposed aquatic organisms through other environmental compartments. However, few studies have correlated both bioaccumulation of pharmaceutical compounds and the consequent effects. Analytical methodology to detect pharmaceuticals at trace quantities in biota has advanced significantly in the last few years. Nonetheless, there are still unresolved analytical challenges associated with the complexity of biological matrices, which require exhaustive extraction and purification steps, and highly sensitive and selective detection techniques. This review presents the trends in the analysis of pharmaceuticals in aquatic organisms in the last decade, recent data about the occurrence of these compounds in natural biota, and the environmental implications that chronic exposure could have on aquatic wildlife.","[Huerta, B.; Rodriguez-Mozaz, S.; Barcelo, D.] Catalan Inst Water Res ICRA, Girona 17003, Spain; [Barcelo, D.] IDAEA CSIC, Dept Environm, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Institut Catala de Recerca de l'Aigua (ICRA); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Investigacion y Desarrollo Pascual Vila (CID-CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Diagnostico Ambiental y Estudios del Agua (IDAEA),"Huerta, B (corresponding author), Catalan Inst Water Res ICRA, Emili Grahit 101, Girona 17003, Spain.",bhuerta@icra.cat,"BARCELO, DAMIA/O-4558-2016; Huerta, Belinda/GMW-7976-2022; Rodriguez-Mozaz, Sara/P-6048-2014","BARCELO, DAMIA/0000-0002-8873-0491; Rodriguez-Mozaz, Sara/0000-0003-2962-8144; Huerta, Belinda/0000-0003-4392-4898",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CSD2009-00065]; European Union,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); European Union(European Union (EU)),This study was co-financed by Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the project SCARCE (Consolider-Ingenio 2010 CSD2009-00065) and by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund (FEDEr).

In addition, the striking differences in the environment experienced by wild and cultured fishes offers considerable scope both for unplanned, natural selection for different inherited behavioural phenotypes and for behavioural differences arising from differential experience. In this paper, the evidence that such processes have produced behavioural differences between wild and cultured fishes is reviewed in relation to feeding, antipredator responses, aggression and reproductive behaviour. The reported findings are discussed in relation to the concept of 'behavioural syndromes', or suites of co-varying behavioural traits that adapt individuals of the same population to spatial and temporal variation in selection regimes. The implications of the behaviour of cultured fishes for their welfare in production cages, for the environmental impact of escapees on wild stocks and for the success of hatchery-based restocking programmes are considered. The review inevitably concentrates on salmonids, in which such phenomena have been intensively researched.

Sexual selection can accelerate or hinder adaptation to abiotic challenges in a variety of ways, but the effect of sexual selection on resistance evolution is little studied. Here, we examine this question using experimental evolution in the pest insect Tribolium castaneum. The experimental removal of sexual selection slowed the evolution of resistance in populations treated with pyrethroid pesticide, and also reduced the rate at which resistance was lost frompesticide-free populations. These results suggest that selection arising fromvariance in mating and fertilization success can augment natural selection on pesticide resistance, meaning that sexual selection should be considered when designing strategies to limit the evolution of pesticide resistance.","[Jacomb, Frances; Marsh, Jason] Australian Natl Univ, Div Evolut Ecol & Genet, Res Sch Biol, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Holman, Luke] Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Melbourne, Vic 3052, Australia",Australian National University; University of Melbourne,"Holman, L (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Melbourne, Vic 3052, Australia.",luke.holman@unimelb.edu.au,,,DECRA fellowship from Australian Research Council [DE140101481]; Australian Research Council [DE140101481] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,DECRA fellowship from Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank Patrick Collins and colleagues (Postharvest Grain Protection Unit, Queensland) for generously providing beetle stocks and culturing advice, and Bayer CropScience for providing Deltamethrin.

At the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada, a long-term, whole-lake experiment was conducted using a before-after-control-impact design to determine both direct and indirect effects of the synthetic oestrogen used in the birth control pill, 17 alpha-ethynyloestradiol (EE2). Algal, microbial, zooplankton and benthic invertebrate communities showed no declines in abundance during three summers of EE2 additions (5-6 ng l(-1)), indicating no direct toxic effects. Recruitment of fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) failed, leading to a near-extirpation of this species both 2 years during (young-of-year, YOY) and 2 years following (adults and YOY) EE2 additions. Body condition of male lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and male and female white sucker (Catostomus commersonii) declined before changes in prey abundance, suggesting direct effects of EE2 on this endpoint. Evidence of indirect effects of EE2 was also observed. Increases in zooplankton, Chaoborus, and emerging insects were observed after 2 or 3 years of EE2 additions, strongly suggesting indirect effects mediated through the reduced abundance of several small-bodied fishes. Biomass of top predator lake trout declined by 23-42% during and after EE2 additions, most probably an indirect effect from the loss of its prey species, the fathead minnow and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus). Our results demonstrate that small-scale studies focusing solely on direct effects are likely to underestimate the true environmental impacts of oestrogens in municipal wastewaters and provide further evidence of the value of whole-ecosystem experiments for understanding indirect effects of EDCs and other aquatic stressors.","[Kidd, Karen A.] Univ New Brunswick, Canadian Rivers Inst, St John, NB E2L 4L5, Canada; [Kidd, Karen A.] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol, St John, NB E2L 4L5, Canada; [Paterson, Michael J.; Rennie, Michael D.; Podemski, Cheryl L.; Findlay, Dave L.; Blanchfield, Paul J.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Freshwater, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N6, Canada; [Paterson, Michael J.; Rennie, Michael D.] Int Inst Sustainable Dev, Expt Lakes Area, Winnipeg, MB R3B 0Y4, Canada; [Liber, Karsten] Univ Saskatchewan, Toxicol Ctr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B3, Canada",University of New Brunswick; University of New Brunswick; Fisheries & Oceans Canada; University of Saskatchewan,"Kidd, KA (corresponding author), Univ New Brunswick, Canadian Rivers Inst, St John, NB E2L 4L5, Canada.",kiddk@unb.ca,"Paterson, Michael/AGT-8809-2022; Kidd, Karen/ABG-3237-2020","Paterson, Michael/0000-0002-8526-9126; Kidd, Karen/0000-0002-5619-1358; Blanchfield, Paul/0000-0003-0886-5642; Rennie, Michael/0000-0001-7533-4759",Fisheries and Oceans Canada's Environmental Sciences Strategic Research Fund; American Chemistry Council Long Range Initiative Program; Canadian Federal Toxic Substances Research Initiative; Canadian Network of Toxicology Centres; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Fisheries and Oceans Canada's Environmental Sciences Strategic Research Fund; American Chemistry Council Long Range Initiative Program; Canadian Federal Toxic Substances Research Initiative; Canadian Network of Toxicology Centres; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"Funding for this study was received from Fisheries and Oceans Canada's Environmental Sciences Strategic Research Fund, American Chemistry Council Long Range Initiative Program, the Canadian Federal Toxic Substances Research Initiative, the Canadian Network of Toxicology Centres and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.",,61,130,137,7,167,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8436,1471-2970,,PHILOS T R SOC B,Philos.

However, it is unclear how behavioral modifications recorded in laboratory assays are expressed in natural ecosystems, a limitation that makes it difficult to evaluate the predictive power of laboratory-based measurements. In this study, we hypothesized that exposure to a benzodiazepine (i.e., oxazepam) increases boldness and activity in laboratory assays as well as in field assays-that is, laboratory results can be used to predict field results. Moreover, we expected the modified behavior to affect other important ecological measures such as habitat selection and home range. To test our hypothesis, we exposed European perch (Perca fluviatilis) to oxazepam and measured subsequent changes in behavioral trials both in laboratory assays and in a lake ecosystem populated with a predatory fish species, pike (Esox lucius). In the lake, the positions of both perch and pike were tracked every 3 min for a month using acoustic telemetry. In the laboratory assay, the oxazepam-exposed perch were bolder and more active than the non-exposed perch. In the lake assay, the oxazepam-exposed perch were also more bold and active, had a larger home range, and used pelagic habitats more than the non-exposed perch. We conclude that ecotoxicological behavioral assays are useful for predicting the effects of exposure in natural systems. However, although individual responses to exposure were similar in both the laboratory and field trials, effects were more obvious in the field study, mainly due to reduced variability in the behavioral measures from the lake. Hence, short-term behavioral assays may fail to detect all the effects expressed in natural environments. Nevertheless, our study clearly demonstrates that behavioral modifications observed in laboratory settings can be used to predict how fish perform in aquatic ecosystems.","[Klaminder, Jonatan; Hellstrom, Gustav; Fahlman, Johan; Jonsson, Micael; Lagesson, Annelle; Brodin, Tomas] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden; [Fick, Jerker] Umea Univ, Dept Chem, Umea, Sweden; [Bergman, Eva] Karlstad Univ, Dept Environm & Life Sci, Karlstad, Sweden",Umea University; Umea University; Karlstad University,"Klaminder, J (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden.",jonatan.klaminder@umu.se,"Berglund Fick, Jerker/HDO-5788-2022; Bergman, Eva/R-8464-2016; Jonsson, Micael/E-6839-2012","Brodin, Tomas/0000-0003-1086-7567; Fick, Jerker/0000-0002-3949-7371; Klaminder, Jonatan/0000-0001-8814-0013",Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation,Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation(Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation),The study was financed through a fellowship to JK given by Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation.,,46,32,34,0,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Despite the bulk of the human population living in Asia and Africa (mostly in low-or middle-income countries), limited work relating to research, development and regulations on APIs in the environment have so far been conducted in these regions. Also, the API manufacturing sector is gradually shifting to countries with lower production costs. This paper focuses mainly on APIs for human consumption and highlights key differences between the low-, middle-and high-income countries, covering factors such as population and demographics, manufacture, prescriptions, treatment, disposal and reuse of waste and wastewater. The striking differences in populations (both human and animal), urbanization, sewer connectivity and other factors have revealed that the environmental compartments receiving the bulk of API residues differ markedly between low-and high-income countries. High sewer connectivity in developed countries allows capture and treatment of the waste stream (point-source). However, in many low-or middle-income countries, sewerage connectivity is generally low and in some areas waste is collected predominantly in septic systems. Consequently, the diffuse-source impact, such as on groundwater from leaking septic systems or on land due to disposal of raw sewage or septage, may be of greater concern. A screening level assessment of potential burdens of APIs in urban and rural environments of countries representing low-and middle-income as well as high-income has been made. Implications for ecological risks of APIs used by humans in lower income countries are discussed.","[Kookana, Rai S.; Williams, Mike] CSIRO, Private Mail Bag 2, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia; [Boxall, Alistair B.

Unfortunately, standardized approaches, including HTS experimental designs, for examining fish behavioral responses to contaminants are rarely available. In the present study, we examined movement behavior of larval zebrafish over 7 days (4-10 days post fertilization or dpf) during typical daylight workday hours to determine whether intrinsic activity differed with age and time of day. We then employed an early life stage approach using the Fish Embryo Test (FET) at multiple developmental ages to evaluate whether photomotor response (PMR) behavior differed with zebrafish age following exposure to diazinon (DZN), a well-studied orthophosphate insecticide, and diphenhydramine (DPH), an antihistamine that also targets serotonin reuptake transporters and the acetylcholine receptor. 72 h studies were conducted at 1-4, 4-7 and 7-10 dpf, followed by behavioral observations using a ViewPoint system at 4, 7 and 10 dpf. Distance traveled and swimming speeds were quantified; nominal treatment levels were analytically verified by isotope-dilution LC-MSMS. Larval zebrafish locomotion displayed significantly different (p < 0.05) activity profiles over the course of typical daylight and workday hours, and these time of day PMR activity profiles were similar across ages examined (4-10 dpf). 10 dpf zebrafish larvae were consistently more sensitive to DPH than either the 4 or 7 dpf larvae with an environmentally realistic lowest observed effect concentration of 200 ng/L. Though ELS and FET studies with zebrafish typically focus on mortality or teratogenicity in 0-4 dpf organisms, behavioral responses of slightly older fish were several orders of magnitude more sensitive to DPH. Our observations highlight the importance of understanding the influence of time of day on intrinsic locomotor activity, and the age-specific hazards of aquatic contaminants to fish behavior.

To what extent such pharmaceutical contamination accumulates and disperses over time in different compartments of aquatic food webs is not well known. In this study we assess to what extent five pharmaceuticals (diphenhydramine, oxazepam, trimethopiim, diclofenac, and hydroxyzine) are taken up by fish (European perch) and four aquatic invertebrate taxa (damselfly larvae, mayfly larvae, waterlouse, and ramshorn snail), by tracing their bioconcentrations over several months in a semi-natural large-scale (pond) system. The results suggest both significant differences among drugs in their capacity to bioaccumulate and differences among species in uptake. While no support for in situ uptake of diclofenac and trimethoprim was found, oxazepam, cliphenhyclramine, and hydroxyzine were detected in all analyzed species. Here, the highest bioaccumulation factor (tissue:water ratio) was found for hydroxyzine. In the food web, the highest concentrations were found in the benthic species ramshorn snail and waterlouse, indicating that bottom-living organism at lower trophic positions are the prime receivers of the pharmaceuticals. In general, concentrations in the biota decreased over time in response to decreasing water concentrations. However, two interesting exceptions to this trend were noted. First, mayfly larvae (primarily grazers) showed peak concentrations (a fourfold increase) of oxazepam, cliphenhydramine, and hydroxyzine about 30 days after initial addition of pharmaceuticals. Second, perch (top-predator) showed an increase in concentrations of oxazepam throughout the study period. Our results show that drugs can remain bioavailable for aquatic organism for long time periods (weeks to months) and even re-enter the food web at a later time. As such, for an understanding of accumulation and dispersion of pharmaceuticals in aquatic food webs, detailed ecological knowledge is required. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this introduction to more detailed papers that follow, we aim to provide an oversight of the field. We review current knowledge on mutation rates and their harmful and beneficial effects on fitness and then consider theories that predict the fate of individual mutations or the consequences of mutation accumulation for quantitative traits. Many advances in the past built on models that treat the evolution of mutations at each DNA site independently, neglecting linkage of sites on chromosomes and interactions of effects between sites ( epistasis). We review work that addresses these limitations, to predict how mutations interfere with each other. An understanding of the population genetics of mutations of individual loci and of traits affected by many loci helps in addressing many fundamental and applied questions: for example, how do organisms adapt to changing environments, how did sex evolve, which DNA sequences are medically important, why do we age, which genetic processes can generate new species or drive endangered species to extinction, and how should policy on levels of potentially harmful mutagens introduced into the environment by humans be determined?","[Loewe, Laurence; Hill, William G.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Loewe, Laurence] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Syst Biol Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh,"Loewe, L (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",laurence.loewe@ed.ac.uk,"Hill, William G/B-3198-2012",,BBSRC [BB/D019621/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/D019621/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/D019621/1] Funding Source: Medline,BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),,,132,130,162,6,80,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8436,1471-2970,,PHILOS T R SOC B,Philos.

We tested the lethal and sub-lethal effects of treated seed ingestion by the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), a game bird of high socio-economic value in Spain. One year-old partridges (n = 42 pairs) were fed for 10 days in spring (prior to breeding) with wheat treated with difenoconazole (fungicide), thiram (fungicide) or imidacloprid (insecticide), using two doses for each pesticide (the one recommended, and its double to represent potential cases of abuse of pesticides). We investigated the direct and indirect effects on the body condition, physiology, immunology, coloration and subsequent reproduction of exposed partridges. For the latter, eggs were collected, measured and incubated and the growth and survival of chicks were monitored. Thiram and imidacloprid at high exposure doses produced mortalities of 41.6 and 58.3 %, respectively. The first death was observed at day 3 for imidacloprid and at day 7 for thiram. Both doses of the three pesticides caused sublethal effects, such as altered biochemical parameters, oxidative stress and reduced carotenoid-based coloration. The high exposure doses of imidacloprid and thiram also produced a decrease in cellular immune response measured by the phytohemagglutinin test in males. Bearing in mind the limitation of the small number of surviving pairs in some treatments, we found that the three pesticides reduced the size of eggs and imidacloprid and difenoconazole also reduced the fertilization rate. In addition, both thiram and imidacloprid reduced chick survival. These experiments highlight that the toxicity of pesticide-treated seeds is a factor to consider in the decline of birds in agricultural environments.","[Lopez-Antia, Ana; Ortiz-Santaliestra, Manuel E.; Mateo, Rafael] CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain; [Mougeot, Francois] CSIC, EEZA, Almeria 04120, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Investigacion en Recursos Cinegeticos (IREC); Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Experimental de Zonas Aridas (EEZA),"Ortiz-Santaliestra, ME (corresponding author), CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC, Ronda de Toledo S-N, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain.",manuele.ortiz@uclm.es,"Santaliestra, Manuel Eloy Ortiz/B-2517-2015; Lopez-Antia, Ana/AAH-8775-2019; Mougeot, Francois/B-1894-2009; Mougeot, Francois/Y-9569-2019; Mateo, Rafael/A-3117-2011","Santaliestra, Manuel Eloy Ortiz/0000-0001-7102-0496; Lopez-Antia, Ana/0000-0002-8343-4490; Mougeot, Francois/0000-0002-5819-6275; Mougeot, Francois/0000-0002-5819-6275; Mateo, Rafael/0000-0003-1307-9152",FEDENCA (Real Federacion Espanola de Caza); Oficina Nacional de la Caza; Fundacion Biodiversidad,FEDENCA (Real Federacion Espanola de Caza); Oficina Nacional de la Caza; Fundacion Biodiversidad,"Study financed by FEDENCA (Real Federacion Espanola de Caza) and Oficina Nacional de la Caza with the partnership of Fundacion Biodiversidad.

Unfortunately, speciation biologists often consider sexual selection in isolation from natural selection, even though sexually selected traits evolve in an ecological context: both preferences and traits are often subject to natural selection. Conversely, while behavioural ecologists may address ecological effects on sexual communication, they rarely measure the consequences for population divergence. Herein, we review the empirical literature addressing the mechanisms by which natural selection and sexual selection can interact during speciation. We find that convincing evidence for any of these scenarios is thin. However, the available data strongly support various diversifying effects that emerge from interactions between sexual selection and environmental heterogeneity. We suggest that evaluating the evolutionary consequences of these effects requires a better integration of behavioural, ecological and evolutionary research.","[Maan, Martine E.] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; Eawag Ctr Ecol Evolut & Biogeochem CEEB, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland",University of Bern; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG),"Maan, ME (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Baltzerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",martine.maan@eawag.ch,"Maan, Martine/B-5444-2008; Seehausen, Ole/C-8272-2011","Maan, Martine/0000-0003-1113-8067; Seehausen, Ole/0000-0001-6598-1434",Swiss National Science Foundation,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We thank Katie Wagner, Carole Smadja, Michael Ryan, Ken Kraaijeveld and three anonymous referees for comments and discussion.

However, the ecological consequences of such behavioral changes, such as effects on toxicant transfer in foodwebs, are far less well understood, complicated in part by the short-term nature of laboratory experiments and the lack of complementary field studies where the nature of toxicant exposure is more complex. Here we examine whether naturally exposed individuals of the round goby, a benthic, site-loyal fish, move in a manner similar to conspecifics from less contaminated habitats. In the laboratory, round goby from a relatively cleaner site showed greater activity and exploration than goby from two highly contaminated sites. Male fish were more active than females but the site effects were similar in both sexes. In contrast to laboratory findings, a field mark-recapture study of 881 round goby showed that fish from the cleaner site did not move greater distances or exhibit shorter residence times within the site than round goby from highly contaminated sites. Our results indicate that while behavioral changes in the laboratory may be one of several useful diagnostics of toxicant exposure of wild-exposed animals, they do not necessarily translate readily into measurable differences in a natural context. Thus, the potential fitness consequences of toxicant exposure based on behavioral changes need to be assessed carefully.","[Marentette, Julie R.; Tong, Stephanie; Wang, Grace; Sopinka, Natalie M.; Taves, Matthew D.; Balshine, Sigal] McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Koops, Marten A.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Great Lakes Lab Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Burlington, ON, Canada",McMaster University; Fisheries & Oceans Canada,"Marentette, JR (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",marentjr@mcmaster.ca,"Taves, Matthew Donald/AAW-3148-2020; Koops, Marten/A-4534-2010","Taves, Matthew Donald/0000-0002-4841-059X; Koops, Marten/0000-0002-3676-7946; Balshine, Sigal/0000-0003-3671-0517",NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada); Canadian Foundation for Innovation; NSERC,NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canadian Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for Innovation); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"We thank Susan Marsh-Rollo of McMaster University and Tys Theysmeyer and field crew of the Royal Botanical Gardens for valuable field advice and assistance.

This has become an issue of considerable concern as vultures are a keystone species and their decline has a range of socio-economic, as well as cultural and biodiversity impacts. In this paper, we review these impacts and estimate in detail the economic cost of one of them: the human health impacts of the vulture decline. Livestock carcasses provide the main food supply for vultures, and are also eaten by dogs. Dogs are the main source of rabies in humans in India, and their populations have increased substantially in parallel with the vulture decline. The potential human health impact of rabies associated with the vulture decline is found to be significant. This, and a wide range of other impacts suggest that significant resources should be put into (1) testing of pharmaceutical products to ensure that similar situations are not repeated, (2) helping vulture populations to recover through the use of alternative drugs to diclofenac that are of low toxicity to vultures, and (3) through conservation breeding programmes.

There is considerable evidence for endocrine disruption from aquatic ecosystems, but knowledge is lacking with regard to the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here, we show for the first time that birds foraging on invertebrates contaminated with environmental pollutants, show marked changes in both brain and behaviour. We found that male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) exposed to environmentally relevant levels of synthetic and natural estrogen mimics developed longer and more complex songs compared to control males, a sexually selected trait important in attracting females for reproduction. Moreover, females preferred the song of males which had higher pollutant exposure, despite the fact that experimentally dosed males showed reduced immune function. We also show that the key brain area controlling male song complexity (HVC) is significantly enlarged in the contaminated birds. This is the first evidence that environmental pollutants not only affect, but paradoxically enhance a signal of male quality such as song. Our data suggest that female starlings would bias their choice towards exposed males, with possible consequences at the population level. As the starling is a migratory species, our results suggest that transglobal effects of pollutants on terrestrial vertebrate physiology and reproduction could occur in birds.","[Markman, Shai; Barnsley, Sara; Mueller, Carsten T.; Pascoe, David; Buchanan, Katherine L.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Leitner, Stefan; Catchpole, Clive] Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham, Surrey, England; [Leitner, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Neurobiol, Seewiesen, Germany",Cardiff University; University of London; Royal Holloway University London; Max Planck Society,"Markman, S (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",buchanankl1@Cardiff.ac.uk,"Buchanan, Kate/A-8178-2012; Leitner, Stefan/D-2129-2012; Müller, Carsten T/A-7114-2010","Buchanan, Kate/0000-0002-6648-5819; Leitner, Stefan/0000-0002-9482-0362; Müller, Carsten T/0000-0003-0455-7132","BBSRC [S18938, C500260]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [S18938] Funding Source: researchfish",BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),This project was supported by BBSRC research grants S18938 and C500260.,,34,76,84,0,51,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,FEB 27,2008,3,2,,,,,,,e1674,10.1371/journal.pone.0001674,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001674,,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,367XS,18301751,"Green Published, Green Accepted, gold",,,2024-03-03,WOS:000260586500018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Particularly concerning are pharmaceutical pollutants that can adversely impact exposed wildlife, even at extremely low concentrations. One such contaminant is the widely prescribed antidepressant fluoxetine, which can disrupt neurotransmission and behavioural pathways in wildlife. Despite this, relatively limited research has addressed the behavioural impacts of fluoxetine at ecologically realistic exposure concentrations. Here, we show that 28-day fluoxetine exposure at two ecologically relevant dosages one representing low surface water concentrations and another representing high effluent flow concentrations alters antipredator behaviour in Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). We found that fluoxetine exposure at the lower dosage resulted in increased activity levels irrespective of the presence or absence of a predatory dragonfly nymph (Hemianax papuensis). Additionally, irrespective of exposure concentration, fluoxetine-exposed fish entered the predator 'strike zone' more rapidly. In a separate experiment, fluoxetine exposure reduced mosquitofish freezing behaviour a common antipredator strategy following a simulated predator strike, although, in females, this reduction in behaviour was seen only at the lower dosage. Together, our findings suggest that fluoxetine can cause both non-monotonic and sex-dependent shifts in behaviour. Further, they demonstrate that exposure to fluoxetine at environmentally realistic concentrations can alter antipredator behaviour, with important repercussions for organismal fitness.

Previous theoretical models of the effect of sexual selection on average individual fitness in a population have mostly predicted that sexually selected populations should adapt faster and clear deleterious mutations more quickly than populations where sexual selection is not operating. 2. While some laboratory studies have supported these predictions, others have not and studies of field systems have tended to find negative effects of sexual selection, or no effect. The negative effects of sexual selection found in field and other studies are usually ascribed to the costs associated with strong sexual selection acting on the population. 3. Here, using an individual-based model that allows feedback between demographic and evolutionary processes, we find that sexual selection can lead to both increases and decreases in population-level fitness measures such as extinction probability and adaptation rate. Whether fitness increases or decreases depends on a variety of environmental and demographic factors including the nature of environmental change, the carrying capacity of the environment, the average fecundity of the population in question and the strength of condition dependence. 4. In many cases, our model predicts that sexual selection leads to higher extinction probability in small populations because of an increased risk of demographic stochasticity, but lower extinction probability in larger populations because of faster adaptation rates. This is consistent with field studies that have mostly focussed on very small populations such as recently introduced birds, and tend to find negative effects, and also with laboratory studies that tend to use larger populations and have tended to find positive effects. 5. These findings go at least some way towards an understanding of the apparent contradictions between theoretical predictions, laboratory studies and field data.","[Martinez-Ruiz, Carlos; Knell, Robert J.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Knell, RJ (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England.",r.knell@qmul.ac.uk,"Knell, Robert/IVU-7726-2023","Martinez-Ruiz, Carlos/0000-0002-4817-0565",,,,,46,66,70,1,78,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Marsh frogs inhabiting wetlands in Sumgayit are exposed to complex mixtures of chemical contaminants, including petroleum products, pesticides, heavy metals, and many other industrial chemicals. Previous results documented elevated estimates of genetic damage in marsh frogs front the two most heavily, contaminated sites. Based oil mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequence data, the Sumgayit region has reduced levels of genetic diversity, likely due to environmental degradation. The Sumgayit region also acts as all ecological sink, with levels of gene flow into the region exceeding gene flow out of the region. Additionally, localized mtDNA heteroplasmy and diversity patterns suggest that one of the most severely contaminated sites in Sumgayit is acting as a source of new mutations resulting from an increased mutation rate. This Study provides an integrated method for assessing the cumulative population impacts of chronic contaminant exposure by Studying both population genetic and evolutionary effects.","Duke Univ, Integrated Toxicol Program, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Sch Rural Publ Hlth, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Civil Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Vet Anat & Publ Hlth, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Sumgayit Ctr Environm Rehabil, Sumgayit, Azerbaijan; Russian Acad Sci, Vavilov Inst Gen Genet, Moscow, Russia",Duke University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M Health Science Center; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Russian Academy of Sciences; Vavilov Institute of General Genetics,"Matson, CW (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Integrated Toxicol Program, LSRC A346,Box 90328, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",marson@duke.edu,"Matson, Cole W/F-7992-2010; Politov, Dmitry V./H-9520-2014","Matson, Cole W/0000-0002-6472-9357;","NIEHS NIH HHS [ES 04917, P42 ES004917] Funding Source: Medline",NIEHS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)),,,45,49,63,1,38,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

The presence of these products, designed to modulate human physiology and behaviour, has created concern over whether PhACs similarly affect aquatic organisms. Though laboratory studies are beginning to address the effects of individual PhACs on fish behaviour, few studies have assessed the effects of exposure to complex, realistic wastewater effluents on fish behaviour. In this study, we exposed a wild, invasive fish species-the round goby (Neogobiusmelanostomus)-to treated wastewater effluent (0%, 50% or 100% effluent dilutions) for 28 days. We then determined the impact of exposure on fish aggression, an important behaviour for territory acquisition and defense. We found that exposure to 100% wastewater effluent reduced the number of aggressive acts that round goby performed. We complimented our behavioural assay with measures of pharmaceutical uptake in fish tissues. We detected 11 of 93 pharmaceutical compounds that we tested for in round goby tissues, and we found that concentration was greatest in the brain followed by plasma, then gonads, then liver, and muscle. Fish exposed to 50% and 100% effluent had higher tissue concentrations of pharmaceuticals and concentrated a greater number of pharmaceutical compounds compare to control fish exposed to no (0%) effluent. Exposed fish also showed increased ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in liver tissue, suggesting that fish were exposed to planar halogenated/polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PHHs/PAHs) in the wastewater effluent. Our findings suggest that fish in effluent-dominated systems may have altered behaviours and greater tissue concentration of PhACs. Moreover, our results underscore the importance of characterizing exposure to multiple pollutants, and support using behaviour as a sensitive tool for assessing animal responses to complex contaminant mixtures, like wastewater effluent.

Selection of genetically inherited tolerance on exposed populations, here referred as micro-evolution due to pollution, has been recognized as one of the causes of these changes. However, there is a gap between studies addressing this process and those assessing effects at higher levels of biological organization. In this review we attempt to address these evolutionary considerations into the ecological risk assessment (ERA) of polluting events and to trigger the discussion about the consequences of this process for the ecosystem response to toxic stress. We provide clear evidence that pollution drives micro-evolutionary processes in several species. When this process occurs, populations inhabiting environments that become polluted may persist. However, due to the existence of ecological costs derived from the loss of genetic variability, negative pleiotropy with fitness traits and/or from physiological alterations, micro-evolution due to pollution may alter different properties of the affected populations. Despite the existence of empirical evidence showing that safety margins currently applied in the ERA process may account for pollution-induced genetic changes in tolerance, information regarding long-term ecological consequences at higher levels of biological organization due to ecological costs is not explicitly considered in these procedures. In relation to this, we present four testable hypotheses considering that micro-evolution due to pollution acts upon the variability of functional response traits of the exposed populations and generates changes on their functional effect traits, therefore, modifying the way species exploit their ecological niches and participate in the overall ecosystem functioning.

With improved visual and non-visual assessment tools and increased knowledge of the importance of behavior for organism health and fitness, interest in behavioral analysis has increased in recent years. However, to our knowledge there has never been a quantitative assessment of the available techniques for organismal toxicity testing, so it is not clear whether behavioral studies represent valuable additions to environmental monitoring. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the relative sensitivities and average durations of behavioral studies to those assessing acute lethality, development and reproduction. Results demonstrate that the average duration of behavioral studies is consistently less than developmental or reproductive studies, and that behavioral endpoints are generally more sensitive than those assessing development or reproduction. We found effect sizes to be lower but power to be higher in behavioral and reproductive studies compared to studies assessing development, which likely relates to low sample sizes commonly used in developmental studies. Overall, we conclude that behavioral studies are comparatively fast and sensitive, and therefore warrant further attention as tools for assessing the toxicological effects of environmental contaminants. We suggest that research aimed at developing and optimizing techniques for behavioral analysis could prove extremely useful to the field of toxicology, but that future work must be directed at determining what specific behaviors are most sensitive to various classes of contaminants, and at understanding the relevance of changes to discrete behaviors for influencing organismal and population-level health and fitness.

A population decline of >95%, starting in the 1990s, was first noted at Keoladeo National Park, India(2). Since then, catastrophic declines, also involving Gyps indicus and Gyps tenuirostris, have continued to be reported across the subcontinent(3). Consequently these vultures are now listed as critically endangered by BirdLife International(4). In 2000, the Peregrine Fund initiated its Asian Vulture Crisis Project with the Ornithological Society of Pakistan, establishing study sites at 16 OWBV colonies in the Kasur, Khanewal and Muzaffargarh-Layyah Districts of Pakistan to measure mortality at over 2,400 active nest sites(5). Between 2000 and 2003, high annual adult and subadult mortality (5-86%) and resulting population declines (34-95%) (ref. 5 and M. G., manuscript in preparation) were associated with renal failure and visceral gout. Here, we provide results that directly correlate residues of the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac with renal failure. Diclofenac residues and renal disease were reproduced experimentally in OWBVs by direct oral exposure and through feeding vultures diclofenac-treated livestock. We propose that residues of veterinary diclofenac are responsible for the OWBV decline.","Washington State Univ, Dept Vet Microbiol & Pathol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Peregrine Fund, Boise, ID 83709 USA; US Geol Survey, Natl Wildlife Hlth Ctr, Madison, WI 53711 USA; Zool Soc San Diego, Ctr Reprod Endangered Species, San Diego, CA 92112 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Fresno Branch, Calif Anim Hlth & Food Safety Lab Syst, Fresno, CA 93725 USA; Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Inst Pure & Appl Biol, Div Zool, Multan, Pakistan",Washington State University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Zoological Society of San Diego; University of California System; University of California Davis; Bahauddin Zakariya University,"Oaks, JL (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Vet Microbiol & Pathol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",loaks@vetmed.wsu.edu,"Arshad, Muhammad/K-7335-2019; Arshad, Muhammad/GXW-0743-2022","Arshad, Muhammad/0000-0001-5501-6956; Gilbert, Martin/0000-0002-9930-4383",,,,,30,1144,1312,11,531,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,FEB 12,2004,427,6975,,,,,630,633,,10.1038/nature02317,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature02317,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,773AJ,14745453,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000188875300040,View Full Record in Web of Science

Changes in these end-points resulting from chemical exposure can cause alterations in micro-evolutionary forces (mutation, drift, selection and gene flow) that control the genetic composition of populations. With multi-generation exposures, anthropogenic contamination can lead to a population with an altered genetic composition, which may respond differently to future stressors. These evolutionary changes are rarely discussed in regulatory or risk assessment frameworks, but the growing body of literature that documents their existence suggests that these important population-level impacts should be considered. In this meta-analysis we have compared existing contamination levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that have been documented to be associated with evolutionary changes in resident aquatic organisms to regulatory benchmarks for these contaminants. The original intent of this project was to perform a meta-analysis on evolutionary events associated with PCB and PAH contamination. However, this effort was hindered by a lack of consistency in congener selection for total PCB or PAH measurements. We expanded this manuscript to include a discussion of methods used to determine PCB and PAH total contamination in addition to comparing regulatory guidelines and contamination that has caused evolutionary effects. Micro-evolutionary responses often lead populations onto unique and unpredictable trajectories. Therefore, to better understand the risk of population-wide alterations occurring, we need to improve comparisons of chemical contamination between affected locations. In this manuscript we offer several possibilities to unify chemical comparisons for PCBs and PAHs that would improve comparability among evolutionary toxicology investigations, and with regulatory guidelines. In addition, we identify studies documenting evolutionary change in the presence of PCB and PAH contamination levels below applicable regulatory benchmarks.","[Oziolor, Elias M.; Matson, Cole W.] Baylor Univ, Inst Biomed Studies, CRASR, Dept Environm Sci, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [De Schamphelaere, Karel] Univ Ghent, GhEnToxLab Unit, Lab Environm Toxicol & Aquat Ecol, Jozef Plateaustr 22, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Baylor University; Ghent University,"Matson, CW (corresponding author), Baylor Univ, Inst Biomed Studies, CRASR, Dept Environm Sci, Waco, TX 76798 USA.",cole_matson@baylor.edu,"Guenat, Heather/H-6528-2014; freire, fernanda/AAX-1814-2021; Matson, Cole W/F-7992-2010; De Schamphelaere, Karel/A-1600-2008; Oziolor, Elias/P-6961-2016","Matson, Cole W/0000-0002-6472-9357; De Schamphelaere, Karel/0000-0002-5063-922X; Oziolor, Elias/0000-0002-4078-1054",,,,,49,19,21,1,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0963-9292,1573-3017,,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Ecotoxicology,DEC,2016,25,10,,,,,1858,1866,,10.1007/s10646-016-1735-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-016-1735-6,,,9,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,ED6JT,27699564,Green Published,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000388962600017,View Full Record in Web of Science

By treating female red-spotted newts, Notophthalmus viridescens, to a commonly used insecticide, endosulfan, we found that the pheromonal system is highly susceptible to low-concentration exposure. The impairment of the pheromonal system directly led to disrupted mate choice and lowered mating success. There were no other notable physiologic or behavioral changes demonstrated by the animals at the insecticide concentrations administered.

Estimation of the likelihood of effects from exposures to sublethal concentrations of contaminants in effluent plumes downstream of point sources poses a challenge when conducting ecological risk assessments (ERAs). This is an issue for regulatory agencies worldwide. This paper reviews the importance and availability of information on behavioural toxicity and identifies opportunities for its inclusion in ERAs. One of the major advantages of using data on behavioural effects is that they are more sensitive indicators of potential for impacts on survival in the field than are measures of lethality. Indications from available data for fish suggest that behavioural effects of organic contaminants often occur at concentrations 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than those found to elicit mortality. As a result, it is believed that the use of data on behavioural toxicity in ERAs could benefit the assessment process a great deal, allowing for the consideration of more ecologically significant and protective hazard and exposure scenarios.","Environm Canada, Sci & Risk Assessment Directorate, Existing Subst Div, Gatineau, PQ K1A 0H3, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada,"Robinson, PD (corresponding author), Environm Canada, Sci & Risk Assessment Directorate, Existing Subst Div, 200 Sacre Coeur,8th Floor,Fontaine Bldg, Gatineau, PQ K1A 0H3, Canada.",,,,,,,,57,66,74,1,35,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Although meta-analyses do frequently uncover signatures of local adaptation, they also reveal many exceptions. We suggest that particular constraints on local adaptation might arise when organisms are exposed to novel stressors, such as anthropogenic pollution. To inform this possibility, we studied the extent to which guppies (Poecilia reticulata) show local adaptation to oil pollution in southern Trinidad. Neutral genetic markers revealed that paired populations in oil-polluted versus not-polluted habitats diverged independently in two different watersheds. Morphometrics revealed some divergence (particularly in head shape) between these environments, some of which was parallel between rivers. Reciprocal transplant experiments in nature, however, found little evidence of local adaptation based on survival and growth. Moreover, subsequent laboratory experiments showed that the two populations from oil-polluted sites showed only weak local adaptation even when compared to guppies from oil-free northern Trinidad. We conclude that guppies show little local adaptation to oil pollution, which might result from the challenges associated with adaptation to particularly stressful environments. It might also reflect genetic drift owing to small population sizes and/or high gene flow between environments.","[Rolshausen, Gregor; Hendry, Andrew P.] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada; [Rolshausen, Gregor; Hendry, Andrew P.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada; [Phillip, Dawn A.

Although sublethal doses of insecticides are known to alter behaviour, current studies on the relationship between toxicants and behaviour tend to ignore effects on individual variation. Our objective was to determine whether sublethal exposure to an organophosphate insecticide could affect the consistency of individual behaviour and disrupt behavioural correlations, in a jumping spider occurring in agroecosystems. Adults of the jumping spider Eris militaris (Araneae: Salticidae) were scored by an open-field and a prey-capture assay, each conducted pre- and post- exposure to the organophosphate insecticide phosmet. Half of the individuals received no exposure to the insecticide to provide a control group. We then estimated the changes in repeatability, a measure of the extent of personality differences, and in behavioural correlations between control and insecticide-treated groups. Although insecticide exposure had no discernable effects on the population's average behaviours, insecticide-exposed individuals showed an average of 23% lower repeatability and the correlation between activity and prey capture was more strongly collapsed in females. Our results provide clear evidence that exposure to sublethal doses of insecticides on an important arthropod predator in agroecosystems causes substantial alteration of personality differences even in absence of a population-wide shift in behaviour. This suggests that insecticide effects are more complex than previously thought and indicates high variation in the way individuals coped with insecticidal exposure. By altering the consistency of behavioural traits and their correlations, exposure to sublethal concentrations of insecticides can have subtle effects on behavioural expression, which may ultimately affect biocontrol performance in an important arthropod predator in agroecosystems. Our study calls for an increasing focus on individual behavioural variation when testing the effects of pesticides on non-targeted fauna.","[Royaute, Raphael; Buddle, Christopher M.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Royaute, Raphael; Vincent, Charles] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Hort Res & Dev Ctr, St Jean, PQ J3B 3E6, Canada",McGill University; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada,"Royauté, R (corresponding author), N Dakota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 1340 Bolley Dr, Fargo, ND 58102 USA.",raphael.royaute@gmail.com,"Royauté, Raphaël/B-9772-2015","Royauté, Raphaël/0000-0002-5837-633X; Buddle, Christopher/0000-0002-7494-9732",National Science and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC); Agriculture and Agri-food Canada; McGill University,National Science and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Agriculture and Agri-food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada); McGill University,"We thank Monique Audette, Gay Grunner and Mary Pavlik for access to field sites.

One compound of great concern is fluoxetine, which is one of the most widely prescribed psychoactive drugs in the world and frequently detected in the environment. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 28-d fluoxetine exposure at two environmentally relevant levels (measured concentrations: 4 ng/L and 16 ng/L) on anti-predator behaviour in wild guppies (Poecilia reticulata). This was achieved by subjecting fluoxetine-exposed and unexposed guppies to a simulated bird strike and recording their subsequent behavioural responses. We found that exposure to fluoxetine affected the anti-predator behaviour of guppies, with exposed fish remaining stationary for longer (i.e. 'freezing' behaviour) after the simulated strike and also spending more time under plant cover. By contrast, con-trol fish were significantly more active and explored the tank more, as indicated by the distance covered per minute over the period fish spent swimming. Furthermore, behavioural shifts were sex-dependent, with evidence of a non-monotonic dose-response among the fluoxetine-exposed fish. This is one of the first studies to show that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of fluoxetine can alter the anti-predator behaviour of adult fish.

Despite their widespread use, the impacts of these pesticides on the neurological health of wild salmon are not well understood. Of particular concern are the organophosphate and carbamate insecticides that block synaptic transmission by inhibiting neuronal acetylcholinesterase. Here we assess the effects of diazinon, an organophosphate insecticide, on alarm pheromone induced antipredator responses and homing behavior in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Nominal exposure concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mu g.L-1) were chosen to emulate diazinon pulses in the natural environment. In the antipredator study, diazinon had no effect on swimming behavior or visually guided food capture. However, the pesticide significantly inhibited olfactory-mediated alarm responses at concentrations as low as 1.0 mu g.L-1. Similarly, homing behavior was impaired at 10.0 mu g.L-1. Our results suggest that olfactory-mediated behaviors are sensitive to anticholinesterase neurotoxicity in salmonids and that short-term, sublethal exposures to these insecticides may cause significant behavioral deficits. Such deficits may have negative consequences for survival and reproductive success in these fish.","Natl Ctr Marine Res, NOAA, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Environm Conservat Div, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; Univ Washington, Sch Fisheries, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Scholz, NL (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Marine Res, NOAA, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Environm Conservat Div, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",,"Scholz, Nathaniel L/L-1642-2013","Scholz, Nathaniel L/0000-0001-6207-0272; Berejikian, Barry/0000-0003-2933-7806",,,,,40,158,184,2,60,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0706-652X,,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Accordingly, a great deal of previous research has characterized physiological mechanisms of toxicity in animals exposed to contaminants. In contrast, effects of contaminants on fish behaviour are less frequently studied. Because behaviour links physiological function with ecological processes, behavioural indicators of toxicity appear ideal for assessing the effects of aquatic pollutants on fish populations. Here we consider the many toxicants that disrupt complex fish behaviours, such as predator avoidance, reproductive, and social behaviours. Toxicant exposure often completely eliminates the performance of behaviours that are essential to fitness and survival in natural ecosystems, frequently after exposures of lesser magnitude than those causing significant mortality. Unfortunately, the behavioural toxicity of many xenobiotics is still unknown, warranting their future study. Physiological effects of toxicants in the literature include disruption of sensory, hormonal, neurological, and metabolic systems, which are likely to have profound implications for many fish behaviours. However, little toxicological research has sought to integrate the behavioural effects of toxicants with physiological processes. Those studies that take this multidisciplinary approach add important insight into possible mechanisms of behavioural alteration. The most commonly observed links with behavioural disruption include cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition, altered brain neurotransmitter levels, sensory deprivation, and impaired gonadal or thyroid hormone levels. Even less frequently studied are the implications of interrelated changes in behaviour and physiology caused by aquatic pollutants for fish populations. We conclude that future integrative, multidisciplinary research is clearly needed to increase the significance and usefulness of behavioural Judicators for aquatic toxicology, and aim to highlight specific areas for consideration.

Models of dispersal and habitat use explain variation in ability to cope with habitat change (loss, fragmentation). Many models assume that organisms use one main cue axis to evaluate options.

Since avoidance has been shown to be a relevant behavioral endpoint, our aims were: (i) to determine if TCS is able to trigger an avoidance response in Poecilia reticulata; (ii) to predict the population immediate decline (PID) caused by TCS exposure, by integrating lethality and avoidance responses; and (iii) to verify the overestimation of risk when mortality is assessed under forced exposure. Fish were exposed to TCS in a forced exposure system, to assess mortality, and to a TCS gradient in a non-forced exposure (NFE) system. Two NFE scenarios were simulated: (#1) a spatially permanent gradient, including low and high concentrations; and (#2) a scenario with high concentrations, simulating a local discharge. The fish avoided TCS concentrations as low as 0.2 mu g L-1 (avoidance of 22%). The AC50 obtained from scenario #1 (8.04 mu g L-1) was about 15 times more sensitive than that from scenario #2 (118.4 mu g L-1). In general, up to the highest concentration tested (2000 mu g L-1), the PID was determined by the avoidance. Mortality from the forced exposure was overestimated (48 h-LC50 of 1650 mg L-1), relative to the NFE. The reduced mortality in a non-forced environment does not imply a lower effect, because part of the population is expected to disappear by moving towards favorable environments. TCS is a potential environmental disturber, since at environmentally relevant concentrations (< 2 mu g L-1) it could cause a decline in the fish population. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here the physiological and behavioural effects of metal exposure in relation to monoaminergic systems were considered by exposing rainbow trout dyads, demonstrating stable dominance relationships, to cadmium or lead. Fish exposed to 4 mug l(-1) cadmium accumulated more cadmium at the gill than fish held in control water. Fish exposed to 7 mug l(-1) cadmium had higher gill, liver and kidney cadmium concentrations. No significant lead accumulation was seen after exposure to 46 mug l(-1) for 48 h but exposure to 325 mug l(-1) lead caused an increase in gill, liver and kidney lead concentrations. Brain accumulation of both cadmium and lead was only seen after exposure to the highest concentrations. Exposure to 4 or 7 mug l(-1) cadmium, or 46 or 325 mug l(-1) lead for 48 h did not disrupt established dominance hierarchies. As expected with this stable behavioural situation, in control pairs, animals of different social status displayed different physiological profiles. Subordinate fish had higher concentrations of circulating plasma cortisol and telencephalic 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid/5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (5-HIAA/5-HT) ratios. However, these physiological profiles were affected by metal exposure, with a trend towards higher serotonergic activity in dominant fish. Dominants exposed to 325 mug l(-1) lead had significantly higher hypothalamic 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios when compared with subordinates. The results demonstrate that if stable social hierarchies are established in control water they may not be affected by exposure to cadmium and lead although physiological changes may be evident.

These social structures occur both within natural salmonid populations and in aquaculture with associated implications for conservation and welfare. Competitive behaviour of fish is influenced by the physiological ability to perceive and process information about potential opponents and the level of coordination and energy stores available to successfully perform during social encounters. Many trace metals are known to interfere with these physiological processes and can affect the ability of salmonid fish to form dominance hierarchies. Additionally, socially mediated differences in physiology occur among individual fish within a dominance hierarchy, which can result in specific social ranks becoming more susceptible to aquatic toxicants. Understanding dominance behaviours in salmonid fish, the individual differences in physiology that they generate and the potential effects of trace metals on these social structures is imperative for conserving natural salmonid populations.

Evidence for altered physiology in fish as a consequence of endocrine disruption is global, with some of the most widely reported effects on sexual development and function. In recent years, research has shown that fish behaviors can also be affected by EDCs which potentially has wide implications for individual fitness and population level outcomes. This review presents a critical assessment on reported effects of EDCs on behavior in fish, focusing on behaviors associated with reproduction. We investigate commonalities and differences in sexual behaviors between fish species most commonly applied in ecotoxicology, drawing out common principles for impacts of EDCs and then reviewing the evidence for, and implications of, disruptions of these behaviors after exposures to EDCs. In an analysis of the reported effects of exposure to the estrogen ethinylestradiol, we show that life-stage at exposure is a key factor determining behavioral responses of affected populations. EDC-induced changes in behavior occur at similar concentrations as for established biomarker responses (e. g. vitellogenin induction for estrogens), indicating behavior is equally sensitive (and noninvasive) as an indicator of EDC exposure. Adopting behaviors in fish as indicators of chemical exposure and effects, however, still has many technical and interpretation challenges and there is very little information available on how behaviors under laboratory conditions equate with those occurring in wild populations.","[Soeffker, Marta; Tyler, Charles R.] Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Tyler, CR (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",C.R.Tyler@exeter.ac.uk,"Soeffker, M/KBC-2650-2024; Soeffker, M/D-3258-2009","Soeffker, M/0000-0002-7131-5486",University of Exeter,University of Exeter,The authors gratefully acknowledge the University of Exeter for funding Marta Soeffker.

However, few studies have investigated the impact of such contaminants on the behavior of individuals living in exposed waters. Contaminant exposure can affect animal populations by disrupting behaviors including feeding, locomotion, and mating. In this study, we examined how living in an ecosystem polluted by combinations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, iron, lead, zinc) impacts contest behavior in the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). Fish collected from heavily contaminated and cleaner sites in Lake Ontario were subjected to a resource contest to determine the effect of these contaminants on aggression and the establishment of dominance hierarchies, which in turn influence access to food, shelter, and mating opportunities. Dominance establishment (a clear resource winner) was less obvious among fish from the contaminated site compared to the more stable hierarchies that formed between pairs of fish from the clean site. Pairs of fish from the contaminated site performed more assessment displays compared to fish from clean sites. These results suggest that the costs of living in an environment under exposure can shape behavioral repertoires. The altered conflict resolution strategies of contaminated fish may reflect impaired cognitive function, sensory perception, and/or higher metabolic load associated with aggression. This study provides support for the utilization of quantifiable behavioral differences as ecologically relevant measures of contaminant exposure.","[Sopinka, Natalie M.; Marentette, Julie R.; Balshine, Sigal] McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Anim Behav Grp, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada",McMaster University,"Sopinka, NM (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Anim Behav Grp, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",natsopinka@gmail.com,,"Balshine, Sigal/0000-0003-3671-0517",Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI); Ontario Innovation Trust (OIT); Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation; National Science and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC),"Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Ontario Innovation Trust (OIT); Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation(Ministry of Research and Innovation, Ontario); National Science and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","We kindly thank C.

The impact of these changes on inter- and intra-specific communication, and its evolutionary consequences, has only recently started to receive research attention. A disruption of the sensory environment is likely to impact communication, especially with respect to reproductive interactions that help to maintain species boundaries. Aquatic ecosystems around the world are being threatened by a variety of environmental stressors, causing dramatic losses of biodiversity and bringing urgency to the need to understand how fish respond to rapid environmental changes. Here, we discuss current research on different communication systems (visual, chemical, acoustic, electric) and explore the state of our knowledge of how complex systems respond to environmental stressors using fish as a model. By far the bulk of our understanding comes from research on visual communication in the context of mate selection and competition for mates, while work on other communication systems is accumulating. In particular, it is increasingly acknowledged that environmental effects on one mode of communication may trigger compensation through other modalities. The strength and direction of selection on communication traits may vary if such compensation occurs. However, we find a dearth of studies that have taken a multimodal approach to investigating the evolutionary impact of environmental change on communication in fish. Future research should focus on the interaction between different modes of communication, especially under changing environmental conditions. Further, we see an urgent need for a better understanding of the evolutionary consequences of changes in communication systems on fish diversity.","[van der Sluijs, Inke; Gray, Suzanne M.; Hendry, Andrew P.; Krahe, Ruediger] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Amorim, Maria Clara P.] ISPA, Unidade Invest Ecoetol, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal; [Barber, Iain] Univ Leicester, Dept Biol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Candolin, Ulrika] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Hendry, Andrew P.] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Maan, Martine E.] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Maan, Martine E.] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Biogeochem, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland; [Utne-Palm, Anne Christine] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Wagner, Hans-Joachim] Univ Tubingen, Inst Anat, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Wong, Bob B.

In many species of freshwater fish, social recognition is known to be based primarily on chemical cues. Such recognition mechanisms are vulnerable to disruption by the presence of anthropogenic contaminants in the aquatic environment. Here we show that acute exposure to low, environmentally relevant dosages of the ubiquitous contaminant, 4-nonylphenol, can seriously affect social recognition and ultimately social organization in fishes. A 1 hour 0.5 mu g l(-1) dose was sufficient to alter the response of members of a shoaling fish species (juvenile banded killifish, Fundulus diaphanus) to conspecific chemical cues. Dosages of 1-2 mu g l(-1) caused killifish to orient away from dosed conspecifics, in both a flow channel and an arena. Given the overall importance of shoaling as an adaptive strategy against predators and for locating food, it is likely that its disruption by anthropogenic contaminants would have serious implications for fishes' fitness.","[Ward, Ashley J.

There is an extensive literature on laboratory behavioral assays, with many chemicals impairing feeding or predator avoidance. However, there is not extensive work on fishes that live in contaminated environments. Therefore, we then review our recent research on feeding and trophic relations of populations from contaminated estuaries compared with relatively unpolluted sites. The mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus, is a non-migratory fish; those from more contaminated areas are poor predators and slower to capture active prey (grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio). In the field, they consume much detritus and sediment, which is not nutritious. They are less active than fish from cleaner sites and more vulnerable to predation. They have altered thyroid glands and neurotransmitter levels, which may underlie altered behaviors. Fish from the reference site kept in tanks with sediment and food from the polluted site showed bioaccumulation and reduced prey capture after two months, although fish from the polluted site did not show significant improvement when maintained in a clean environment. Poor nutrition and predator avoidance may be responsible for their being smaller and having a shorter life span than reference fish. Bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix, are a marine species in which the young-of-the-year spend their first summer in estuaries. We found bioaccumulation of contaminants and reduced activity, schooling, and feeding in young-of-the-year bluefish from a relatively unpolluted site that were fed prey fish from a contaminated site. They also had altered thyroid glands and neurotransmitter levels. Many field-caught specimens had empty stomachs, which is rare in this species. In the fall, when they migrate back out to the ocean, they are smaller, slower, and more likely to starve or to be eaten than those that spent their summer in cleaner estuaries [Current Zoology 58 (1): 9-20, 2012].","[Weis, Judith S.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Candelmo, Allison] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, James Howard Lab, Highlands, NJ 07732 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Newark; Rutgers University New Brunswick; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA),"Weis, JS (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",jweis@andromeda.rutgers.edu,,,NJ Sea Grant Program; NOAA; Rutgers University Marine Field Station (RUMFS); Meadowlands Environmental Research Institute (MERI),NJ Sea Grant Program; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Rutgers University Marine Field Station (RUMFS); Meadowlands Environmental Research Institute (MERI),"We appreciate the assistance of numerous undergraduate students and of the staff at the James Howard NOAA Laboratory at Sandy Hook New Jersey.

Here we review how key features of populations, the characteristics of environmental pollution, and the genetic architecture underlying adaptive traits, may interact to shape the likelihood of evolutionary rescue from pollution. Large populations of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) persist in some of the most contaminated estuaries of the United States, and killifish studies have provided some of the first insights into the types of genomic changes that enable rapid evolutionary rescue from complexly degraded environments. We describe how selection by industrial-pollutants and other stressors has acted on multiple populations of killifish and posit that extreme nucleotide diversity uniquely positions this species for successful evolutionary adaptation. Mechanistic studies have identified some of the genetic underpinnings of adaptation to a well-studied class of toxic pollutants; however, multiple genetic regions under selection in wild populations seem to reflect more complex responses to diverse native stressors and/or compensatory responses to primary adaptation. The discovery of these pollution-adapted killifish populations suggests that the evolutionary influence of anthropogenic stressors as selective agents occurs widely. Yet adaptation to chemical pollution in terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate wildlife may rarely be a successful solution to pollution because potentially adaptive phenotypes may be complex and incur fitness costs, and therefore be unlikely to evolve quickly enough, especially in species with small population sizes.","[Whitehead, Andrew] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Toxicol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Clark, Bryan W.] US EPA, Atlantic Ecol Div, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Off Res & Dev,Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, Narragansett, RI USA; [Reid, Noah M.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Storrs, CT USA; [Hahn, Mark E.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Hahn, Mark E.] Boston Univ, Superfund Res Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Nacci, Diane] US EPA, Atlantic Ecol Div, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Off Res & Dev, Narragansett, RI USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; Oak Ridge Associated Universities; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge Institute for Science & Education; United States Environmental Protection Agency; University of Connecticut; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Boston University; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Whitehead, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Toxicol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",awhitehead@ucdavis.edu,"Hahn, Mark/AAV-7516-2020","Hahn, Mark/0000-0003-4358-2082","National Science Foundation [DEB-1265282, OCE-1314567, DEB-1120263]; National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences [R01ES021934-01, P42ES007381]; Postdoctoral Research Program at the US Environmental Protection (US EPA) Office of Research and Development; Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) [DW92429801]; US Department of Energy; Directorate For Geosciences [1314567] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences [1314454] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Ocean Sciences [1314567] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)); Postdoctoral Research Program at the US Environmental Protection (US EPA) Office of Research and Development; Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE); US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1265282, OCE-1314567 and DEB-1120263; National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences, Grant/Award Number: R01ES021934-01 and P42ES007381; Postdoctoral Research Program at the US Environmental Protection (US EPA) Office of Research and Development; Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), Grant/Award Number: DW92429801; US Department of Energy",,227,85,109,4,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1752-4571,,,EVOL APPL,Evol.

First, population genetic models indicate that genetic variation and potential response to selection should be positively correlated with population size. The empirical support for this prediction is mixed: DNA markers usually reveal low heterozygosity in small populations, whereas quantitative traits show reduced heritability only in the smallest and most inbred populations. Quantitative variation can even increase in bottlenecked populations although this effect seems unlikely to increase the adaptive potential of populations. Second, individuals in small populations have lower fitness owing to environmental stress and genetic problems such as inbreeding, which can substantially increase the extinction probability of populations in changing environments. This second reason has not been included in assessments of critical population size assuring evolvability and makes it likely that many small threatened populations have a decreased potential for adaptation.","Univ Melbourne, Ctr Environm Stress & Adaptat Res, Dept Zool, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; Univ Melbourne, Dept Genet, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Zurich,"Willi, Y (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Ctr Environm Stress & Adaptat Res, Dept Zool, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",yvonne.willi@agrl.ethz.ch; josh.vanbuskirk@zool.unizh.ch; ary@unimelb.edu.au,"Hoffmann, Ary/C-2961-2011; Hoffmann, Ary/R-2972-2019","Hoffmann, Ary/0000-0001-9497-7645; Van Buskirk, Josh/0000-0002-0486-3626",,,,,135,627,740,7,329,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1543-592X,1545-2069,,ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S,Annu.

The pervasive nature of EDCs within aquatic environments and their multiple sub-lethal effects make assessments of their impact especially important but also highly challenging. Herein, we review the data on EDC effects in aquatic systems focusing on studies assessing populations and ecosystems, and including how biotic and abiotic processes may affect, and be affected by, responses to EDCs. Recent research indicates a significant influence of behavioural responses (e.g. enhancing feeding rates), transgenerational effects and trophic cascades in the ecological consequences of EDC exposure. In addition, interactions between EDCs and other chemical, physical and biological factors generate uncertainty in our understanding of the ecological effects of EDCs within aquatic ecosystems. We illustrate how effect thresholds for EDCs generated from individual-based experimental bioassays of the types commonly applied using chemical test guidelines [e.g. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)] may not necessarily reflect the hazards associated with endocrine disruption. We argue that improved risk assessment for EDCs in aquatic ecosystems urgently requires more ecologically oriented research as well as field-based assessments at population-, community- and food-web levels.","[Windsor, Fredric M.; Ormerod, Steve J.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Windsor, Fredric M.; Tyler, Charles R.] Univ Exeter, Dept Biosci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England",Cardiff University; University of Exeter,"Windsor, FM (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales.;Windsor, FM (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Dept Biosci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",windsorfm@cardiff.ac.uk,"Windsor, Fredric/H-9354-2019; Ormerod, Steve J/A-4326-2010","Windsor, Fredric/0000-0001-5030-3470; Ormerod, Steve J/0000-0002-8174-302X","Natural Environmental Research Council [NE/L002434]; NERC [NE/K004263/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K004263/1, 1642617] Funding Source: researchfish",Natural Environmental Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This work was supported by the Natural Environmental Research Council [NE/L002434/] (F.M.W.).

For many species, behavioral adjustments represent the first response to altered conditions. In this review, we consider the pivotal role that behavior plays in determining the fate of species under human-induced environmental change and highlight key research priorities. In particular, we discuss the importance of behavioral plasticity and whether adaptive plastic responses are sufficient in keeping pace with changing conditions. We then examine the interplay between individual behavioral responses and population processes and consider the many ways in which changes in behavior can affect ecosystem function and stability. Lastly, we turn to the evolutionary consequences of anthropogenic change and consider the impact of altered behaviors on the evolutionary process and whether behavior can facilitate or hinder adaptation to environmental change.","[Wong, Bob B.

We report here on research into changes in cadmium uptake and accumulation as mechanisms underlying the increased resistance to Cd in laboratory lines of the least killifish, Heterandria formosa. We compared Cd accumulation between three control lines and three lines selected successfully for an increased Cd-resistance. Individuals of the Cd-adapted lines had a lower short-term (2 h) uptake of Cd than those of the control lines. A time-series experiment showed that selection-line fish had a lower rate of Cd accumulation than fish from the control lines during the first 14 h of exposure to 6 mg/l of Cd. At the 14 h time point, Cd accumulation in the control-line fish approached lethal levels, while Cd levels in selection-line fish from this point on increased at a slower rate than in the initial 14 h. Overall, the relatively small changes in uptake and accumulation patterns caused lethal body burdens in the fish from the selection lines to be reached at more than twice the exposure duration at which this occurred in fish from the control lines. Lethal Cd levels appeared to be the same in control- and selection-line fish. Our results suggest that reduced uptake and accumulation of Cd accounted for approximately two-third of the increased resistance in the Cd-adapted lines. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

These `endocrine-disrupting chemicals' (EDCs) have harmful effects on development and physiology. We reviewed published evidence and found that EDCs also have adverse effects on a wide range of behaviours, including sexual and other reproductive behaviours, activity, motivation, communication, aggression, dominance and other social behaviours, and learning and other cognitive abilities. We also reviewed recent findings that challenge common assumptions in toxicology. For example, EDCs have several unanticipated properties, such as nonmonotonic dose effects and synergy. Furthermore, harmful effects of EDCs sometimes become apparent only when tested in natural ecological conditions, such as social stress and infection. These findings raise questions about the practicality and feasibility of testing chemical pollutants adequately. Finally, we discuss the implications of EDC research for species conservation and human health, and how toxicology and behavioural research might be better integrated. Behaviour might provide a useful indicator or biomarker for detecting harmful chemical contaminants; however, more integration between toxicology and behavioural ecology is needed to determine whether and how EDCs affect humans and other vertebrates outside of the laboratory.
