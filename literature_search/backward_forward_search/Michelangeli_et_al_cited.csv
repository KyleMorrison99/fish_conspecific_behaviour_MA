The peer-reviewed literature now contains studies investigating the effects of chemicals, including pesticides and pharmaceuticals, on migration, dispersal, aggression, sociability, reproduction, feeding and anti-predator behaviours in vertebrates and invertebrates. To understand how behavioural studies could be used in regulatory decision-making we: (1) assessed the legal obstacles to using behavioural endpoints in EU chemicals regulation; (2) analysed the known cases of use of behavioural endpoints in EU chemicals regulation; and (3) provided examples of behavioural endpoints of relevance for population level effects. We conclude that the only legal obstacle to the use of behavioural endpoints in EU chemicals regulation is whether an endpoint is considered to be relevant at the population level or not. We also conclude that ecotoxicity studies investigating behavioural endpoints are occasionally used in the EU chemicals regulation, and underscore that behavioural endpoints can be relevant at the population level. To improve the current use of behavioural studies in regulatory decision-making contribution from all relevant stakeholders is required. We have the following recommendations: (1) researchers should conduct robust, well-designed and transparent studies that emphasize the relevance of the study for regulation of chemicals; (2) editors and scientific journals should promote detailed, reliable and clearly reported studies; (3) regulatory agencies and the chemical industry need to embrace new behavioural endpoints of relevance at the population level.","[Agerstrand, Marlene] Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci ACES, Stockholm, Sweden; [Arnold, Kathryn] Univ York, Dept Environm & Geog, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Balshine, Sigal] McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Brodin, Tomas; McCallum, Erin S.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, Umea, Sweden; [Brooks, Bryan W.] Baylor Univ, Inst Biomed Studies, Dept Environm Sci, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Brooks, Bryan W.] Jinan Univ, Sch Environm, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Maack, Gerd] German Environm Agcy UBA, Dept Pharmaceut, Dessau, Germany; [Pyle, Greg] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Biol Sci, Lethbridge, AB, Canada; [Saaristo, Minna] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Ford, Alex T.] Univ Portsmouth, Inst Marine Sci, Portsmouth, Hants, England",Stockholm University; University of York - UK; McMaster University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Baylor University; Jinan University; University of Lethbridge; Monash University; University of Portsmouth,"ègerstrand, M (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci ACES, Stockholm, Sweden.",marlene.agerstrand@aces.su.se,"Ford, Alex/C-3522-2008; ègerstrand, Marlene/F-9924-2011; McCallum, Erin/AAJ-4052-2020; Guenat, Heather/H-6528-2014; Brooks, Bryan W/B-2612-2010","Ford, Alex/0000-0001-5202-546X; ègerstrand, Marlene/0000-0003-2697-2310; McCallum, Erin/0000-0001-5426-9652; Brooks, Bryan W/0000-0002-6277-9852; Balshine, Sigal/0000-0003-3671-0517; Brodin, Tomas/0000-0003-1086-7567; Maack, Gerd/0000-0001-5980-6533",,,,,117,53,60,2,16,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2050-7887,2050-7895,,ENVIRON SCI-PROC IMP,Environ.

Karl von Frisch discovered the meanings of the waggle dance and called the communication a dance language. Subsequent to this discovery, it has been extensively studied how effectively recruits translate the code in the dance to reach the advertised destination and how the waggle dance information conflicts with the information based on their own foraging experience. The dance followers, mostly foragers, detect and interact with the waggle dancer, and are finally recruited to the food source. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge on the neural processing underlying this fascinating behavior.","[Ai, Hiroyuki] Fukuoka Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8140180, Japan; [Okada, Ryuichi; Sakura, Midori] Kobe Univ, Dept Biol, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Wachtler, Thomas] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Ikeno, Hidetoshi] Univ Hyogo, Dept Human Sci & Environm, Kobe, Hyogo 6700092, Japan",Fukuoka University; Kobe University; University of Munich; University of Hyogo,"Ai, H (corresponding author), Fukuoka Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8140180, Japan.",ai@fukuoka-u.ac.jp,"Wachtler, Thomas/K-3714-2014; Ikeno, Hidetoshi/O-3034-2018","Wachtler, Thomas/0000-0003-2015-6590; Ikeno, Hidetoshi/0000-0002-5134-5485; Ai, Hiroyuki/0000-0001-5748-3996","JSPS KAKENHI [22570079, 25330342, 15K14569, 17K00414, 17H05975, 18K160345, 19H04934, 19K06765]; Strategic International Cooperative Program, Japan Science and Technology Agency; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01GQ1116]; Central Research Institute of Fukuoka University [171031]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19K06765, 19H04934, 22570079, 15K14569, 17H05975, 17K00414] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Strategic International Cooperative Program, Japan Science and Technology Agency(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Central Research Institute of Fukuoka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grants Numbers 22570079, 25330342, 15K14569, 17K00414, 17H05975, 18K160345, 19H04934, 19K06765; by Strategic International Cooperative Program, Japan Science and Technology Agency; by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Grant 01GQ1116); and by the Central Research Institute of Fukuoka University (Grant 171031).",,95,8,9,1,30,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,OCT,2019,10,10,,,,,,,336,10.3390/insects10100336,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects10100336,,,16,Entomology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Entomology,JS8TI,31614450,"Green Published, Green Accepted, gold",,,2024-03-03,WOS:000500573900030,View Full Record in Web of Science

Global concerns about declining bee populations due to agrochemical pollutants have, however, been biased towards the honey bee, Apis mellifera Linnaeus. Here, we analysed the unintended effects of commercial formulations of a neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, and a fungicide mixture of thiophanate-methyl and chlorothalonil on color preference, respiration rates and group locomotory activities of both P. helleri and A. mellifera. Our results revealed that P. helleri foragers that were not exposed to pesticides changed their color preference during the course of a year. By contrast, we found that pesticide exposure altered the color preference of stingless bees in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, imidacloprid decreased the overall locomotion of both bee species, whereas the fungicide mixture increased locomotion of only stingless bees. The fungicide mixture also reduced respiration rates of forager bees of both species. Forager bees of both species altered their color preference, but not their locomotory and respiration rates, when exposed to commercial formulations of each fungicidal mixture component (i.e., chlorothalonil and thiophanate-methyl). Our findings emphasize the importance of P. helleri as a model for Neotropical wild pollinator species in pesticide risk assessments, and also the critical importance of including groups of agrochemicals that are often considered to have minimal impact on pollinators, such as fungicides.

The acetate is administered to livestock via slow-release implants; some is converted by the animal to 17-beta-trenbolone, a relatively potent androgen receptor agonist in mammalian systems. Recent studies indicate that excreted 17-beta-trenbolone is comparatively stable in animal waste, suggesting the potential for exposure to aquatic animals via direct discharge, runoff, or both. However, little is known concerning the toxicity of trenbolone to fish. Our goal was to assess the effects of 17-beta-trenbolone on reproductive endocrinology of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). An in vitro competitive binding study with the fathead minnow androgen receptor demonstrated that 17-beta-trenbolone had a higher affinity for the receptor than that of the endogenous ligand, testosterone. Male and female fish were exposed for 21 d to nominal (target) concentrations of 17-beta-trenbolone ranging from 0.005 to 50 mug/L. Fecundity of the fish was significantly reduced by exposure to measured test concentrations greater than or equal to 0.027 mug/ L. The 17-beta-trenbolone was clearly androgenic in vivo at these concentrations, as evidenced by the de novo production in females of dorsal (nuptial) tubercles, structures normally present only on the heads of mature males. Plasma steroid (testosterone and beta-estradiol) and vitellogenin concentrations in the females all were significantly reduced by exposure to 17-beta-trenbolone. The 17-beta-trenbolone also altered reproductive physiology of male fathead minnows, albeit at concentrations much higher than those producing effects in females. Males exposed to 17-beta-trenbolone at 41 mug/L (measured) exhibited decreased plasma concentrations of 11-ketotestosterone and increased concentrations of beta-estradiol and vitellogenin. Overall, our studies indicate that 17-beta-trenbolone is a potent androgen and reproductive toxicant in fish. Given the widespread use of trenbolone acetate as a growth promoter, and relative stability of its metabolites in animal wastes, further studies are warranted to assess potential ecological risk.","US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Mid Continent Ecol Div, Duluth, MN 55804 USA; US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Expt Toxicol Div, Duluth, MN 55804 USA; Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Reprod Toxicol Div, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; United States Environmental Protection Agency; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Ankley, GT (corresponding author), US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Mid Continent Ecol Div, 6201 Congdon Blvd, Duluth, MN 55804 USA.",ankley.gerald@epa.gov,,"Denny, Jeff/0000-0002-1646-6177; Wilson, Vickie/0000-0003-1661-8481; gray jr, leon earl/0000-0002-1111-4754",,,,,50,326,385,2,113,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0730-7268,1552-8618,,ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM,Environ.

For fish, a large proportion of species spend all or part of their lives in groups, with group coordination playing an important role in the emergent benefits of group-living. Group cohesion can be altered by an array of factors, including exposure to toxic environmental contaminants. Oil spills are one of the most serious forms of pollution in aquatic systems, and while a range of effects of acute oil exposure on animal physiology have been demonstrated, sub-lethal effects on animal behavior are relatively under-studied. Here we used an open-field behavioral assay to explore influence of acute oil exposure on social behavior in a gregarious fish native to the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). We used two oil concentrations (0.7% and 2% oil dilution, or 6.0 +/- 0.9 and 32.9 +/- 5.9 mu gl(-1) Sigma PAH(50) respectively) and assays were performed when all members of a group were exposed, when only one member was exposed, and when no individuals were exposed. Shoal cohesion, as assessed via mean neighbor distance, showed significant impairment following acute exposure to 2% oil. Fish in oil-exposed groups also showed reduced voluntary movement speed. Importantly, overall group cohesion was disrupted when even one fish within a shoal was exposed to 2% oil, and the behavior of unexposed in mixed groups, in terms of movement speed and proximity to the arena wall, was affected by the presence of these exposed fish. These results demonstrate that oil exposure can have adverse effects on fish behavior that may lead to reduced ecological success.","[Armstrong, Tiffany; Killen, Shaun S.; Fearnley, Hannah; Parsons, Kevin J.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Khursigara, Alexis J.; Esbaugh, Andrew J.] Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA",University of Glasgow; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Khursigara, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA.",akhursigara@utexas.edu,"Esbaugh, Andrew J/N-4452-2017","Khursigara, Alexis/0000-0003-0139-2694",Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative [SA-1520]; NERC [NE/J019100/1]; European Research Council [640004]; NERC [NE/J019100/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This research was made possible by a grant from The Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative awarded to AJE, Grant No: SA-1520; Name: Relationship of Effects of Cardiac Outcomes in fish for Validation of Ecological Risk (RECOVER).

Animals are confronted with many different forms of pollution, including chemicals, light, noise, and heat, and these can disrupt critical biological processes such as reproduction. Impacts on reproductive processes can dramatically reduce the number and quality of offspring produced by exposed individuals, and this can have further repercussions on the ecology and evolution of affected populations. Here, we illustrate how environmental pollutants can affect various components of reproduction in wildlife, including direct impacts on reproductive physiology and development, consequences for gamete quality and function, as well as effects on sexual communication, sexual selection, and parental care. We follow with a discussion of the broader ecological and evolutionary consequences of these effects on reproduction and suggest future directions that may enable us to better understand and address the effects of environmental pollution.","[Aulsebrook, Lucinda C.; Bertram, Michael G.; Martin, Jake M.; Hall, Matthew D.; O'Bryan, Moira K.; Wong, Bob B.

As they are often not appropriately removed by sewage treatment plants, pharmaceutical compounds end up in surface water environments worldwide at concentrations in the ng to mu g L-1 range. There is a need to further explore single compound and mixture effects using e.g. in vivo test model systems. We have investigated, for the first time, behavioral effects in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to a binary mixture of an antidepressant drug (citalopram) and a synthetic opioid (tramadol). Citalopram and tramadol have a similar mode of action (serotonin reuptake inhibition) and are known to produce drug-drug interactional effects resulting in serotonin syndrome (SS) in humans. Zebrafish embryo-larvae were exposed to citalopram, tramadol and 1:1 binary mixture from fertilization until 144 h post-fertilization. No effects on heart rate, spontaneous tail coiling, or death/malformations were observed in any treatment at tested concentrations. Behavior (hypoactivity in dark periods) was on the other hand affected, with lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs) of 373 mu g L(-1 )for citalopram, 320 mu g L-1 for tramadol, and 473 mu g L-1 for the 1:1 mixture. Behavioral EC50 was calculated to be 471 mu g L-1 for citalopram, 411 mu g L-1 for tramadol, and 713 mu g L-1 for the 1:1 mixture. The results of this study conclude that tramadol and citalopram produce hypoactivity in 144 hpf zebrafish larvae. Further, a 1:1 binary mixture of the two caused the same response, albeit at a higher concentration, possibly due to SS. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Fluoxetine modulates levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates several important physiological and behavioural processes including fear and anxiety, aggression, locomotion and feeding. In this study, groups of sub-adult Arabian killifish (Aphanius dispar) were exposed to either 0, 0.03, 0.3 or 3 mu g/L fluoxetine hydrochloride for 7 days and their swimming behaviour and social interactions videotaped in a circular arena. The fish were subsequently exposed to a predator alarm chemical (from dragonfly larvae fed with A. dispar) and their short-term responses recorded. The video was analysed using the open-sourced software program Ctrax which objectively quantified swimming and social behaviours. Aggression (chasing behaviour was significantly reduced at 3.0 mu g/L fluoxetine. After the addition of the predator alarm chemicals fish responded quickly, increasing the percentage of time spent drifting or motionless and reducing average swimming velocity. Controls and fish exposed to 0.03 or 3 mu g/L fluoxetine reduced swimming speed by 20-30 % but returned to pre-exposure velocities within 6 min. Fish exposed to 0.3 mu g/L fluoxetine reduced swimming speed by 38 % after addition of the predator alarm and did not return to pre-exposure speeds during the recording period (19 min). Schooling behaviour was also affected by fluoxetine and predator alarm with fish exposed to 0.3 mu g/L fluoxetine significantly reducing nearest neighbour distance and swimming speed relative to nearest neighbour the following addition of the predator alarm.","Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Biol, Muscat 123, Oman",Sultan Qaboos University,"Barry, MJ (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Biol, POB 36, Muscat 123, Oman.",mjbarry@squ.edu.om,"Barry, Michael/D-1337-2013",,Sultan Qaboos University [IG/SCI/BIOL/12/03],Sultan Qaboos University,This study was supported by an internal Grant from Sultan Qaboos University (IG/SCI/BIOL/12/03).,,52,81,87,2,112,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0963-9292,1573-3017,,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Ecotoxicology,MAR,2013,22,2,,,,,425,432,,10.1007/s10646-012-1036-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-012-1036-7,,,8,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,089GF,23264030,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000314898100020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous studies have shown that social organisms frequently benefit from pooling imperfect individual estimates. However, in principle, collective intelligence may also emerge from interactions between individuals, rather than from the enhancement of personal estimates. Here, we reveal that this emergent problem solving is the predominant mechanism by which a mobile animal group responds to complex environmental gradients. Robust collective sensing arises at the group level from individuals modulating their speed in response to local, scalar, measurements of light and through social interaction with others. This distributed sensing requires only rudimentary cognition and thus could be widespread across biological taxa, in addition to being appropriate and cost-effective for robotic agents.","[Berdahl, Andrew; Torney, Colin J.; Ioannou, Christos C.; Faria, Jolyon J.; Couzin, Iain D.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ioannou, Christos C.] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England",Princeton University; University of Bristol,"Berdahl, A (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",aberdahl@princeton.edu; icouzin@princeton.edu,"Couzin, Iain D./Q-6862-2018; Torney, Colin/C-6082-2015","Couzin, Iain D./0000-0001-8556-4558; Ioannou, Christos/0000-0002-9739-889X; Berdahl, Andrew/0000-0002-5057-0103; Torney, Colin/0000-0003-1673-7835","NSF [PHY-0848755, EAGER-1251585, CNH-1211972]; U.S. Office of Naval Research [N00014-09-1-1074]; U.S. Army Research Office [W911NG-11-1-0385]; Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Yukon Foundation; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems [1251424, 1251585] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Physics [0848755] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); U.S. Army Research Office; Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship(Leverhulme Trust); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Yukon Foundation; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS)); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Physics(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"We thank J.

We examined the rate of change in the production and variety of pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and other synthetic chemicals over the past four decades. We compared these rates to those for well-recognized drivers of global change such as rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, nutrient pollution, habitat destruction, and biodiversity loss. Our analysis showed that increases in synthetic chemical production and diversification, particularly within the developing world, outpaced these other agents of global change. Despite these trends, mainstream ecological journals, ecological meetings, and ecological funding through the US National Science Foundation devote less than 2% of their journal pages, meeting talks, and science funding, respectively, to the study of synthetic chemicals.","[Bernhardt, Emily S.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Rosi, Emma J.] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY USA; [Gessner, Mark O.] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Dept Expt Limnol, Berlin, Germany; [Gessner, Mark O.] Berlin Inst Technol, Dept Ecol, Berlin, Germany",Duke University; Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies; Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); Technical University of Berlin,"Bernhardt, ES (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",emily.bernhardt@duke.edu,"Bernhardt, Emily S/D-9940-2011; Bernhardt, Emily S/B-4541-2010; Rosi, Emma/F-1777-2011","Bernhardt, Emily S/0000-0003-3031-621X; Bernhardt, Emily S/0000-0003-3031-621X; Rosi, Emma/0000-0002-3476-6368",Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; IGB Fellowship in Freshwater Science,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); IGB Fellowship in Freshwater Science,"Support for the writing of this manuscript was provided by a Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and an IGB Fellowship in Freshwater Science to ESB.

However, conventional approaches applied to study the impacts of chemical pollutants on wildlife behaviour seldom address the complexity of natural environments in which contamination occurs. The aim of this review is to guide the rapidly developing field of behavioural ecotoxicology towards increased environmental realism, ecological complexity, and mechanistic understanding. We identify research areas in ecology that to date have been largely overlooked within behavioural ecotoxicology but which promise to yield valuable insights, including within- and among-individual variation, social networks and collective behaviour, and multi-stressor interactions. Further, we feature methodological and technological innovations that enable the collection of data on pollutant-induced behavioural changes at an unprecedented resolution and scale in the laboratory and the field. In an era of rapid environmental change, there is an urgent need to advance our understanding of the real-world impacts of chemical pollution on wildlife behaviour. This review therefore provides a roadmap of the major outstanding questions in behavioural ecotoxicology and highlights the need for increased cross-talk with other disciplines in order to find the answers.","[Bertram, Michael G.; McCallum, Erin S.; Cerveny, Daniel; Hellstrom, Gustav; Michelangeli, Marcus; Brodin, Tomas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, Skogsmarksgrand 17, SE-90736 Umea, Sweden; [Martin, Jake M.; Alton, Lesley A.; Brand, Jack A.; Polverino, Giovanni; Tan, Hung; Wong, Bob B.

While the detrimental effects of anthropogenic stressors on the behavior and survival of recruiting fishes are well-documented, the physiological mechanisms that underpin these patterns remain unclear. Here, we use pharmacological treatments to highlight the role that thyroid hormones (TH) play in sensory development and determining anti-predator responses in metamorphosing convict surgeonfish, Acanthurus triostegus. We then show that high doses of a physical stressor (increased temperature of +3 degrees C) and a chemical stressor (the pesticide chlorpyrifos at 30 mu g L-1) induced similar defects by decreasing fish TH levels and affecting their sensory development. Stressor-exposed fish experienced higher predation; however, their ability to avoid predation improved when they received supplemental TH. Our results highlight that two different anthropogenic stressors can affect critical developmental and ecological transitions via the same physiological pathway. This finding provides a unifying mechanism to explain past results and underlines the profound threat anthropogenic stressors pose to fish communities.","[Besson, Marc; Moniz, Isadora; Francois, Loic; Roux, Natacha; Lecchini, David] PSL Res Univ, EPHE UPVD CNRS, USR 3278, CRIOBE, BP 1013, F-98729 Papetoai, French Polynesi, France; [Besson, Marc; Roux, Natacha; Laudet, Vincent] Sorbonne Univ, Observ Oceanol Banyuls Sur Mer, UMR CNRS 7232 BIOM, 1 Ave Pierre Fabre, F-66650 Banyuls Sur Mer, France; [Besson, Marc; Metian, Marc] IAEA, Environm Labs, 4a Quai Antoine 1er, MC-98000 Principality Of Monaco, Monaco; [Feeney, William E.] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Feeney, William E.] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, Seewiesen, Germany; [Feeney, William E.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge, England; [Brooker, Rohan M.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Holzer, Guillaume] ENS Lyon, Inst Genom Fonct Lyon, Lyon, France; [Lecchini, David] Lab Excellence CORAIL, Moorea, French Polynesi, France; [Laudet, Vincent] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol OIST, Marine EcoEvo Devo Unit, 1919-1 Tancha, Onna Son, Okinawa 9040495, Japan",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Sorbonne Universite; Griffith University; Max Planck Society; University of Cambridge; Deakin University; CHU Lyon; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1,"Besson, M (corresponding author), PSL Res Univ, EPHE UPVD CNRS, USR 3278, CRIOBE, BP 1013, F-98729 Papetoai, French Polynesi, France.;Besson, M (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, Observ Oceanol Banyuls Sur Mer, UMR CNRS 7232 BIOM, 1 Ave Pierre Fabre, F-66650 Banyuls Sur Mer, France.;Besson, M (corresponding author), IAEA, Environm Labs, 4a Quai Antoine 1er, MC-98000 Principality Of Monaco, Monaco.",marc.besson@ens-lyon.org,"Besson, Marc/AAB-9030-2020; Brooker, Rohan/AAB-6248-2021; Metian, Marc/F-8010-2018; Besson, Marc/GWQ-9517-2022","Besson, Marc/0000-0003-3381-322X; Brooker, Rohan/0000-0001-8739-6914; Metian, Marc/0000-0003-1485-5029; Besson, Marc/0000-0003-3381-322X; Feeney, William/0000-0002-7475-4724; Francois, Loic/0000-0001-9962-2675; Laudet, Vincent/0000-0003-4022-4175; Holzer, Guillaume/0000-0002-5778-8500","Government of the Principality of Monaco; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [MANINI ANR19-CE34-0006-02]; Contrat de Projet Etat-Polynesie francaise 2015-2020, LabEx Corail (Etape); PSL Environment (Pesticor); Agence de l'eau (Rhone-Mediterranee-Corse) [2018-1765]; Fondation Bettencourt-Schueller; ANSES [2015/1/076]; Griffith University; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation","Government of the Principality of Monaco; Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Contrat de Projet Etat-Polynesie francaise 2015-2020, LabEx Corail (Etape); PSL Environment (Pesticor); Agence de l'eau (Rhone-Mediterranee-Corse); Fondation Bettencourt-Schueller; ANSES; Griffith University(Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation)","We thank Te-mana-o-te-moana, G.

This can be key in important social dynamics such as leadership, which is often positively related to personality traits such as boldness. Individuals consistently differ in how social they are (their sociability), so if other axes of personality variation, such as boldness, can be suppressed during social interactions, this suppression should be stronger in more sociable individuals. We measured boldness (latency to leave a refuge when alone) and sociability (time spent with a conspecific) in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and tested the boldness-leadership association in pairs of these fish. Both boldness and sociability were repeatable, but were not correlated. When splitting the data between the 50% most sociable and 50% less sociable fish, boldness was more strongly associated with leadership in less rather than more sociable individuals. This is consistent with more sociable fish conforming to their partner's behaviour due to their greater social tendency. One axis of personality variation (sociability) can thus modulate the relationship between others (boldness and leadership), with potential implications for selection on personality variation in social animals.","[Bevan, Peggy A.; Gosetto, Isabella; Jenkins, Eliza R.; Barnes, Isobel; Ioannou, Christos C.] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Ioannou, CC (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England.",c.c.ioannou@bristol.ac.uk,,"Ioannou, Christos/0000-0002-9739-889X","Natural Environment Research Council Independent Research Fellowship [NE/K009370/1, NE/P012639/1]; NERC [NE/P012639/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Natural Environment Research Council Independent Research Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This work was supported by a Natural Environment Research Council Independent Research Fellowship (NE/K009370/1) and responsive mode standard grant (NE/P012639/1) awarded to C.C.I.,,34,44,45,7,31,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Filling these knowledge gaps is particularly important regarding amphibians, because they play significant roles in freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, and their populations are declining worldwide. In this study, we investigated two pollutants that have been poorly studied in ecotoxicology despite their widespread occurrence in surface waters: the herbicide terbuthylazine and the pharmaceutical drug carbamazepine. We exposed two anuran species throughout their larval development to each of two environmentally relevant concentrations of each pollutant, and recorded mortality and 17 sub-lethal endpoints up to several months after exposure. Mortality was low and unrelated to treatment. In agile frogs (Rana dalmatina), we found that treatment with 0.3 mu g/L terbuthylazine decreased tadpole activity and reduced fat bodies in juveniles, whereas treatment with 50 mu g/L carbamazepine decreased spleen size and increased spleen pigmentation. In common toads (Bufo bufo), treatment with 0.003 mu g/L terbuthylazine increased body mass at metamorphosis, treatment with 0.3 mu g/L terbuthylazine increased the size of optic tecta, and treatment with 0.5 mu g/L carbamazepine decreased hypothalamus size. Treatment with 50 mu g/L carbamazepine reduced the feeding activity of toad tadpoles, decreased their production of anti-predatory bufadienolide toxins, and increased their body mass at metamorphosis; juvenile toads in this treatment group had reduced spleen pigmentation. Neither treatments affected the time to metamorphosis, post-metamorphic body mass, or sex ratios significantly. These results show that environmental levels of both terbuthylazine and carbamazepine can have several sub-lethal effects on anurans, which may be detrimental to individual fitness and population persistence in natural conditions. Our findings further highlight that toxic effects cannot be generalized between chemicals of similar structure, because the terbuthylazine effects we found do not conform with previously reported effects of atrazine, a related and extensively studied herbicide.

How animals integrate and balance the many signals they receive about their environment is rarely assessed. We investigated how signals from the social and physical environment interact to influence environmental preferences in the endemic Tanganyikan cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. Specifically, we explored how fish respond to the physiological challenge of declining O-2 levels in light of embedded social preferences using a modified shuttle box apparatus to test O-2 preferences. In the presence of a conspecific, the average (preferred) partial pressure of oxygen (Po-2) and minimum Po-2 experienced were significantly lower (14.90 +/- 2.13 and 12.35 +/- 3.15 kPa, respectively) than in trials without a conspecific (17.18 +/- 2.55 and 15.62 +/- 3.09 kPa, respectively). Fish with conspecifics also spent more time in the low Po-2 zone of the shuttle box and moved between the high and low Po-2 zones less frequently. Hence, O-2 preferences were modified, and fish willingly remained in an area of continuously declining O-2 availability to associate with a conspecific. The O-2 preferences of an individual during social trials correlated with its excess postexercise O-2 consumption following an exhaustive chase but not with its aerobic scope, routine O-2 consumption rate, or body mass. These results suggest that some aspects of respiratory and metabolic physiology (such as the propensity to use anaerobic metabolism) but not others (such as O-2 transport capacity) underpin some variation in social behavior under environmental stress.","[Borowiec, Brittney G.; Scott, Graham R.] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [O'Connor, Constance M.; Goodick, Kelsey; Balshine, Sigal] McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [O'Connor, Constance M.] Wildlife Conservat Soc Canada, Thunder Bay, ON P7A 4K9, Canada",McMaster University; McMaster University,"Borowiec, BG (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",,,"Balshine, Sigal/0000-0003-3671-0517",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation; McMaster University; NSERC; E.

Here we show that a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug (oxazepam) alters behavior and feeding rate of wild European perch (Perca fluviatilis) at concentrations encountered in effluent-influenced surface waters. Individuals exposed to water with dilute drug concentrations (1.8 micrograms liter(-1)) exhibited increased activity, reduced sociality, and higher feeding rate.

Description of these systems in terms of important elements was presented. Significant issues involved in developing a screening system were discussed, including selection of endpoints, determination of screening criteria or cutoff values, and ways of acquiring exposure data. There was no scientific consensus regarding to the types and numbers of endpoints incorporated, criteria or screening values for selected endpoints. A risk-based screening-level risk assessment system, therefore, was proposed as a tool to screen chemicals. It was argued that two critical issues concerning the use of risk-based system are effect and exposure characterization. Some suggestions were given for setting screening benchmarks. As for exposure characterization, especially, the potential use of multiresidue methods for obtaining exposure data in screening system was recommended. Given the extensive attention on screening risk chemical substances, it is useful to develop the risk-based screening system for minimizing chemical risks.","[Bu, Qingwei; Wang, Donghong; Wang, Zijian] Chinese Acad Sci, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, State Key Lab Environm Aquat Chem, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES),"Wang, ZJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, Shuangqing Rd 18, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",wangzj@rcees.ac.cn,"Wang, Zhiquan/HHS-6768-2022; Bu, Qingwei/F-4089-2019; Wang, Zijian/A-1538-2009","Bu, Qingwei/0000-0002-3137-4799; wang, dong hong/0000-0003-1061-2185; Wang, Zijian/0000-0002-9847-9691",National Basic Research Program of China [2007CB407301]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [50878205]; National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) [2008AA062501],National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China),"This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (2007CB407301), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 50878205), and National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) (No. 2008AA062501).",,121,29,32,3,110,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1064-3389,1547-6537,,CRIT REV ENV SCI TEC,Crit.

These compounds are only partly removed from wastewaters and, despite their low concentrations, directly and indirectly affect behaviour of freshwater organisms in natural habitats. The aim of this study was to behaviourally assess the effects of an opioid painkiller (tramadol) and antidepressant drug (citalopram) on behaviour patterns of a clonal model species, marbled crayfish. Animals exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of both tested compounds (similar to 1 mu g l(-1)) exhibited significantly lower velocity and shorter distance moved than controls. Crayfish exposed to tramadol spent more time in shelters. Results were obtained by a simple and rapid method recommended as suitable for assessment of behaviour in aquatic organisms exposed to single pollutants and combinations.","[Buric, M.; Grabicova, K.; Kubec, J.; Kouba, A.; Kuklina, I; Kozak, P.; Grabic, R.; Randak, T.] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Fisheries & Protect Waters, South Bohemian Res Ctr Aquaculture & Biodivers Hy, Zatisi 728-2, Vodnany 38925, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Buric, M (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Fisheries & Protect Waters, South Bohemian Res Ctr Aquaculture & Biodivers Hy, Zatisi 728-2, Vodnany 38925, Czech Republic.",buric@frov.jcu.cz,"Grabic, Roman/AAF-5412-2021; Kouba, Anton°n/C-9338-2015; Kubec, Jan/AAJ-6690-2020; Randak, Tomas/G-1798-2015; Grabicova, Katerina/F-7921-2015; Buric, Milos/F-8114-2015; Kozak, Pavel/G-5025-2015","Grabic, Roman/0000-0002-0935-2075; Kouba, Anton°n/0000-0001-8118-8612; Kubec, Jan/0000-0001-8212-1962; Randak, Tomas/0000-0003-0462-266X; Grabicova, Katerina/0000-0002-6026-6260; Buric, Milos/0000-0003-2220-5579; Kozak, Pavel/0000-0002-6985-1538","Czech Science Foundation [16-06498S]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic - project CENAKVA [CZ.1.05/2.1.00/01.0024]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic - project CENAKVA II (under the NPU I program) [LO1205]; Grant Agency of University of South Bohemia [012/2016/Z]","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic - project CENAKVA; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic - project CENAKVA II (under the NPU I program); Grant Agency of University of South Bohemia","The study was financially supported by the Czech Science Foundation (project No. 16-06498S), Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic - projects CENAKVA (No. CZ.1.05/2.1.00/01.0024), CENAKVA II (No. LO1205 under the NPU I program) and by the Grant Agency of University of South Bohemia No. 012/2016/Z.

We evaluated bioaccumulation potential of oxazepam, bromazepam, temazepam, and clobazam in freshwater fish species - perch (Perca fluviatilis) and we conducted a series of behavioral trials to assess their potential to alter boldness, activity, and social behavior. All selected endpoints were studied individually for each target benzodiazepine and as a mixture of all tested compounds to assess possible combinatory effects. We used a three-dimensional automated tracking system to quantify the fish behavior. The four compounds bioconcentrated differently in fish muscle (temazepam > clobazam > oxazepam > bromazepam) at high exposure (9.1, 6.9, 5.7, 8.1 mu g L-1, respectively) and low exposure (0.5, 0.5, 0.3, 0.4 mu g L-1, respectively) concentrations. A significant amount of oxazepam was also measured in fish exposed to temazepam, most likely because of the metabolic transformation of temazepam within the fish. Bromazepam, temazepam, and clobazam significantly affected fish behavior at high concentration, while no statistically significant changes were registered for oxazepam. The studied benzodiazepines affected behavior in combination, because the mixture treatment significantly changed several important behavioral traits even at low concentration, while no single compound exposure had such an effect at that dose. Based on our results, we conclude that effects of pharmaceuticals on aquatic environments could be underestimated if risk assessments only rely on the evaluation of single compounds. More studies focused on the combinatory effects of environmentally relevant mixtures of pharmaceuticals are necessary to fill the gaps in this knowledge. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the effects of two of the most prescribed antidepressants, fluoxetine (FLX) and venlafaxine (VEN) in environmentally realistic concentrations on the predatory behaviour of hatchlings of Sepia officinalis. Newly-hatched cuttlefish were exposed from 1 h (i.e., day 1) to 5 days after hatching to either FLX alone (5 ng.L-1) or combined with VEN (2.5 ng.L-1 or 5 ng.L-1 each) to simulate an environmentally realistic exposure scenario. Their predatory behaviour was analysed through several parameters: prey detection, feeding motivation and success in catching the prey. All parameters improved in control animals over the first five days. The combination of FLX and VEN at 5 ng.L-1 each altered the predatory behaviour of the hatchlings by increasing the latency before attacking the prey, i.e., reducing feeding motivation, as well as by reducing the number of successful attacks. The changes in predatory behaviour tended to reduce food intake and affected growth significantly at 28 days post-hatching. Exposures to either FLX at 5 ng.L-1 or FLX and VEN in mixture at 2.5 ng.L-1 each tended to produce similar effects, even though they were not statistically significant. It is likely that the antidepressants affect maturation of the predatory behaviour and/or learning processes associated with the development of this behaviour. The slightest delay in maturation processes may have detrimental consequences for growth and population fitness. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies demonstrated their negative (e.g. lead, cadmium) or positive (e.g. zinc) effects on body condition, immunity and reproductive success in birds. Because of their effects on bird condition, trace metals are likely to influence the production of condition-dependent plumage colours, that may be used in mate choice. In the feral pigeon Columba livia, we investigated iridescent colouration in response to lead and zinc experimental (i.e. metal supplementation in standardized conditions) and natural exposure (i.e. metal concentrations in feathers of wild urban pigeons), and melanic feather colouration in response to experimental lead and zinc exposure. Both studies (i.e. experimental and correlative) consistently showed that lead exposure decreased iridescent neck feather brightness independently of colour morph. Moreover, lead, when provided alone, decreased melanic feather reflectance in the middle wavelengths while zinc supplementation increased melanic feather reflectance in the violet-wavelength. In conclusion, our study suggests that the colouration of iridescent and melanic feathers depends on the exposure to pollutants. Whether trace metal exposure affected the ability of birds to produce melanin pigments, to grow the microstructural feather elements required for maximum colour display, or to cope with bacteria that degrade feather microstuctures remains unclear. Future studies should investigate whether these metal-induced modifications of plumage colouration affect behaviours involved in sexual selection.","[Chatelain, Marion; Frantz, Adrien; Gasparini, Julien] UPMC Univ Paris 06, UPEC Paris 7, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS,INRA,IRD,Inst Ecol & Sci Environm Paris, Paris, France; [Chatelain, Marion] Warsaw Univ, Ctr New Technol, S Banacha 2c, PL-02097 Warsaw, Poland; [Pessato, Anais; Leclaire, Sarah] CNRS, UMR 5175, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, Montpellier, France; [Leclaire, Sarah] Univ Paul Sabatier, CNRS, ENFA, Lab Evolut & Div Biol,UMR 5174, Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Sorbonne Universite; University of Warsaw; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Ecole Nationale Formation Agronomique (ENSFEA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE),"Chatelain, M (corresponding author), UPMC Univ Paris 06, UPEC Paris 7, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS,INRA,IRD,Inst Ecol & Sci Environm Paris, Paris, France.;Chatelain, M (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ, Ctr New Technol, S Banacha 2c, PL-02097 Warsaw, Poland.",marion.chatelain@live.fr,"Leclaire, Sarah/AAW-2740-2020; CHATELAIN, Marion/I-9594-2019; Gasparini, Julien/J-9263-2012; FRANTZ, Adrien/IST-1062-2023","Leclaire, Sarah/0000-0002-4579-5850; CHATELAIN, Marion/0000-0001-9168-5022; Gasparini, Julien/0000-0003-2594-6567; FRANTZ, Adrien/0000-0002-3508-9047",Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-13-PDOC-0002]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-13-PDOC-0002] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),AP and SL were supported by a research grant from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (No. ANR-13-PDOC-0002 to S.L.).,,102,14,14,1,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2017,126,11,,,,,1542,1553,,10.1111/oik.04262,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.04262,,,12,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FL3KB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000414120900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

To explore how trace levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid impacted colony foraging performance, we equipped bees with RFID tags that allowed us to track their lifetime flight behavior. One group of bees was exposed to a trace concentration (5 mu g/kg, ppb) of imidacloprid in sugar syrup while in the larval stage. The imidacloprid residues caused bees to start foraging when younger as adults and perform fewer orientation flights, and reduced their lifetime foraging flights by 28%. The magnitude of the effects of a trace imidacloprid concentration delivered only during larval stage highlights the severity of pesticide residues for bee foraging performance. Our data suggest that neonicotinoids could impact colony function by imbalancing the normal age based division of labor in a colony and reducing foraging efficiency. Understanding this mechanism will help the development of interventions to safeguard bee colony health.","[Colin, Theotime; Barron, Andrew B.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Meikle, William G.] USDA ARS, Carl Hayden Bee Res Ctr, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Wu, Xiaobo] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Honeybee Res Inst, Nanchang 330029, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Macquarie University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Jiangxi Agricultural University,"Colin, T (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.;Wu, XB (corresponding author), Jiangxi Agr Univ, Honeybee Res Inst, Nanchang 330029, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",theotime.colin@mq.edu.au; wuxiaobo21@163.com,"Colin, Theotime/AAW-7734-2020; Meikle, William/AAC-2481-2022","Barron, Andrew/0000-0002-8135-6628; Meikle, William/0000-0002-1759-6950; Colin, Theotime/0000-0003-0223-4479",Australian Research Council (ARC) [140100452]; United States Department of Agriculture ARS [58-5342-3-004F]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31760714]; iMQRES scholarship from Macquarie University,Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); United States Department of Agriculture ARS(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); iMQRES scholarship from Macquarie University,"We thank Milagra Weiss for her guidance with the imidacloprid dilutions and Jack Westacott and Casey Forster who assisted with the hive evaluations, treatment feeding, and bee tagging.

There are few empirical examples of how differences in collective dynamics emerge from variation among individuals in cognition. Here, we use a naturally variable and heritable learning behavior called latent inhibition (LI) to show that interactions among individuals that differ in this cognitive ability drive collective foraging behavior in honey bee colonies. We artificially selected two distinct phenotypes: high-LI bees that ignore previously familiar stimuli in favor of novel ones and low-LI bees that learn familiar and novel stimuli equally well. We then provided colonies differentially composed of different ratios of these phenotypes with a choice between familiar and novel feeders. Colonies of predominantly high-LI individuals preferred to visit familiar food locations, while low-LI colonies visited novel and familiar food locations equally. Interestingly, in colonies of mixed learning phenotypes, the low-LI individuals showed a preference to visiting familiar feeders, which contrasts with their behavior when in a uniform low-LI group. We show that the shift in feeder preference of low-LI bees is driven by foragers of the high-LI phenotype dancing more intensely and attracting more followers. Our results reveal that cognitive abilities of individuals and their social interactions, which we argue relate to differences in attention, drive emergent collective outcomes.","[Cook, Chelsea N.; Ozturk, Cahit; Smith, Brian H.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Cook, Chelsea N.] Marquette Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA; [Lemanski, Natalie J.; Mosqueiro, Thiago; Pinter-Wollman, Noa] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Gadau, Juergen] Univ Munster, Inst Evolut & Biodivers, D-48149 Munster, Germany",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Marquette University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Munster,"Cook, CN (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.;Cook, CN (corresponding author), Marquette Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA.",chelsea.cook@marquette.edu,"Mosqueiro, Thiago/I-7522-2019","Mosqueiro, Thiago/0000-0001-5808-8189; Cook, Chelsea/0000-0003-3310-2161",NIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM113967]; NIH NIGMS [F32GM126728],NIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)General Electric); NIH NIGMS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),"We thank S.

Here, we investigate imidacloprid's effects on bumblebee worker behavior within the nest, using an automated, robotic platform for continuous, multicolony monitoring of uniquely identified workers. We find that exposure to field-realistic levels of imidacloprid impairs nursing and alters social and spatial dynamics within nests, but that these effects vary substantially with time of day. In the field, imidacloprid impairs colony thermoregulation, including the construction of an insulating wax canopy.

In mammals, such 'social buffering' of stress is mediated by affiliative relationships and production of the neuropeptide oxytocin, but whether these mechanisms facilitate social buffering across vertebrates remains an open question. Therefore, we evaluated whether the social environment influenced the behavioural and physiological recovery from an acute stressor in a group-living cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher. Individual fish that recovered with their social group displayed lower cortisol levels than individuals that recovered alone. This social buffering of the stress response was associated with a tendency towards lower transcript abundance of arginine vasotocin and isotocin in the preoptic area of the brain, suggesting reduced neural activation of the stress axis. Individuals that recovered with their social group quickly resumed normal behaviour but received fewer affiliative acts following the stressor. Further experiments revealed similar cortisol levels between individuals that recovered in visual contact with their own social group and those in visual contact with a novel but non-aggressive social group. Collectively, our results suggest that affiliation and familiarity per se do not mediate social buffering in this group-living cichlid, and the behavioural and physiological mechanisms responsible for social buffering may vary across vertebrates.","[Culbert, Brett M.; Balshine, Sigal] McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Gilmour, Kathleen M.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, 30 Marie Curie Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",McMaster University; University of Ottawa,"Culbert, BM (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",culbertb@uoguelph.ca,"Culbert, Brett/AAI-6090-2020","Culbert, Brett/0000-0002-2830-9590; Balshine, Sigal/0000-0003-3671-0517","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada [RGPIN-2017-05487, RGPIN-2016-05772]; NSERC Master's Canadian Graduate Scholarship (CGS-M); NSERC Doctoral CGS (CGS-D)",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); NSERC Master's Canadian Graduate Scholarship (CGS-M); NSERC Doctoral CGS (CGS-D),This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada Discovery grants to K.M.G.

Understanding the mechanisms that drive social network dynamics requires integrating individual-level biology with comparisons across multiple social networks. Testosterone is a key mediator of vertebrate social behaviour and can influence how individuals interact with social partners. Although the effects of testosterone on individual behaviour are well established, no study has examined whether hormone-mediated behaviour can scale up to shape the emergent properties of social networks. We investigated the relationship between testosterone and social network dynamics in the wire-tailed manakin, a lekking bird species in which male-male social interactions form complex social networks. We used an automated proximity system to longitudinally monitor several leks and we quantified the social network structure at each lek. Our analysis examines three emergent properties of the networks-social specialization (the extent to which a network is partitioned into exclusive partnerships), network stability (the overall persistence of partnerships through time) and behavioural assortment (the tendency for like to associate with like). All three properties are expected to promote the evolution of cooperation. As the predictor, we analysed the collective testosterone of males within each social network. Social networks that were composed of high-testosterone dominant males were less specialized, less stable and had more negative behavioural assortment, after accounting for other factors. These results support our main hypothesis that individual-level hormone physiology can predict group-level network dynamics. We also observed that larger leks with more interacting individuals had more positive behavioural assortment, suggesting that small groups may constrain the processes of homophily and behaviour-matching. Overall, these results provide evidence that hormone-mediated behaviour can shape the broader architecture of social groups. Groups with high average testosterone exhibit social network properties that are predicted to impede the evolution of cooperation.","[Dakin, Roslyn; Ryder, T.

Despite this broad importance, a general framework for predicting social network stability has not been proposed. Here we present longitudinal data on the social dynamics of a cooperative bird species, the wire-tailed manakin, to evaluate the potential causes of temporal network stability. We find that when partners interact less frequently and when social connect-edness increases, the network is subsequently less stable. Social connectivity was also negatively associated with the temporal persistence of coalition partnerships on an annual timescale. This negative association between connectivity and stability was surprising, especially given that individual manakins who were more connected also had more stable partnerships. This apparent paradox arises from a within-individual behavioral trade-off between partnership quantity and quality. Crucially, this trade-off is easily masked by behavioral variation among individuals. Using a simulation, we show that these results are explained by a simple model that combines among-individual behavioral heterogeneity and reciprocity within the network. As social networks become more connected, individuals face a trade-off between partnership quantity and maintenance. This model also demonstrates how among-individual behavioral heterogeneity, a ubiquitous feature of natural societies, can improve social stability. Together, these findings provide unifying principles that are expected to govern diverse social systems.","[Dakin, Roslyn; Ryder, T.

With collective behaviour, social interactions among individuals propagate to affect the behaviour of groups, whereas group-level responses in turn affect individual behaviour. These cross-scale feedback loops between individuals, populations and their environments can provide fitness benefits, such as the efficient exploitation of uncertain resources, as well as costs, such as increased resource competition. Although the social mechanics of collective behaviour are increasingly well-studied, its role in ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here we introduce collective movement into a model of consumer-resource dynamics to demonstrate that collective behaviour can attenuate consumer-resource cycles and promote species coexistence. We focus on collective movement as a particularly well-understood example of collective behaviour. Adding collective movement to canonical unstable ecological scenarios causes emergent social-ecological feedback, which mitigates conditions that would otherwise result in extinction. Collective behaviour could play a key part in the maintenance of biodiversity. Collective movements such as flocking or schooling can benefit a single species, but there may also be wider implications of such behaviour. The authors use a theoretical model to show that collective movement of consumer species can promote species coexistence and ecosystem stability.","[Dalziel, Benjamin D.; Novak, Mark] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Dalziel, Benjamin D.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Math, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Watson, James R.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Ellner, Stephen P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA",Oregon State University; Oregon State University; Oregon State University; Cornell University,"Dalziel, BD (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.;Dalziel, BD (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Math, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",benjamin.dalziel@oregonstate.edu,,"Novak, Mark/0000-0002-7881-4253; Dalziel, Benjamin/0000-0002-9674-2783","US National Science Foundation award [EEID-1911994, DEB-1933497]; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; DARPA Young Faculty Award [YFA N66001-17-1-4038]; NASA A.8 project [80NSSC19K0203SPE]; US National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [R01 GM122062]",US National Science Foundation award(National Science Foundation (NSF)); David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); DARPA Young Faculty Award(United States Department of Defense); NASA A.8 project; US National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),"B.D.D. is supported by US National Science Foundation award EEID-1911994 and by grants from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.

Methylphenidate hydrochloride (MPH; e.g. Ritalin) is a dopaminergic drug that is highly prescribed to adolescent males for the treatment of Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. It has been suggested that MPH could cause transgenerational effects because MPH can affect the male germline in rodents and because paternal effects have been observed in individuals taking similar drugs (e.g. cocaine). Despite these concerns, the transgenerational effects of paternal MPH exposure are unknown. Therefore, we exposed male and female Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to a low, chronic dose of MPH and observed that MPH affected the anxiety/exploratory behaviour of males, but not females. Because of this male-specific effect, we investigated the transgenerational effects of MPH through the paternal line. We observed behavioural effects of paternal MPH exposure on offspring and great-grandoffspring that were not directly administered the drug, making this the first study to demonstrate that paternal MPH exposure can affect descendants. These effects were not due to differential mortality or fecundity between control and MPH lines. These results highlight the transgenerational potential of MPH.","[De Serrano, Alex R.; Rodd, F.

This Perspective uses an understanding of animal sensory ecology to explore how these impacts can be mitigated. Global expansion of human activities is associated with the introduction of novel stimuli, such as anthropogenic noise, artificial lights and chemical agents. Progress in documenting the ecological effects of sensory pollutants is weakened by sparse knowledge of the mechanisms underlying these effects. This severely limits our capacity to devise mitigation measures. Here, we integrate knowledge of animal sensory ecology, physiology and life history to articulate three perceptual mechanisms-masking, distracting and misleading-that clearly explain how and why anthropogenic sensory pollutants impact organisms. We then link these three mechanisms to ecological consequences and discuss their implications for conservation. We argue that this framework can reveal the presence of 'sensory danger zones', hotspots of conservation concern where sensory pollutants overlap in space and time with an organism's activity, and foster development of strategic interventions to mitigate the impact of sensory pollutants. Future research that applies this framework will provide critical insight to preserve the natural sensory world.","[Dominoni, Davide M.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Dominoni, Davide M.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Halfwerk, Wouter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Sect Anim Ecol, Dept Ecol Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Baird, Emily] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, Stockholm, Sweden; [Buxton, Rachel T.; Seymoure, Brett M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Fernandez-Juricic, Esteban] Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Fristrup, Kurt M.; McKenna, Megan F.] Natl Pk Serv, Nat Sounds & Night Skies Div, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Mennitt, Daniel J.] Exponent, Mech Engn Practice, Denver, CO USA; [Perkin, Elizabeth K.] Hatfield Consultants, Environm Monitoring & Assessment Grp, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Stoner, David C.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Tennessen, Jennifer B.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Bellingham, WA USA; [Toth, Cory A.] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Gatineau, PQ, Canada; [Tyrrell, Luke P.] SUNY Coll Plattsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Plattsburgh, NY 12901 USA; [Wilson, Ashley; Francis, Clinton D.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Biol Sci, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Carter, Neil H.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Barber, Jesse R.] Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA",University of Glasgow; Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW); Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Stockholm University; Colorado State University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; United States Department of the Interior; Exponent; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Plattsburgh; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Idaho; Boise State University,"Dominoni, DM (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.;Dominoni, DM (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands.",davide.dominoni@glasgow.ac.uk,"Tyrrell, Luke P/H-9200-2013; Perkin, Elizabeth/AFS-1154-2022; Halfwerk, Wouter/F-2211-2011; Baird, Emily/G-8763-2014; Dominoni, Davide Michelangelo/E-9092-2016","Perkin, Elizabeth/0000-0003-2892-2624; Baird, Emily/0000-0003-3625-3897; Dominoni, Davide Michelangelo/0000-0003-2063-9955; Halfwerk, Wouter/0000-0002-4111-0930; Tennessen, Jennifer/0000-0002-1303-415X; Carter, Neil/0000-0002-4399-6384; Buxton, Rachel/0000-0002-2772-8435",NASA Ecological Forecasting Grant [NNX17AG36G]; NERC [NE/S005773/1] Funding Source: UKRI,NASA Ecological Forecasting Grant; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We are grateful to Lory State Park, Colorado, USA, for hosting our workshop in October 2017 that led to this Perspective.

Larger social groups often enhance transmission rates of pathogens and should be avoided by individuals with poor immune defences. In contrast, more immunocompetent individuals are expected to take advantage of larger group sizes (e.g. better protection, information transfer) with smaller extra costs from pathogen or parasite pressure. Here, we hypothesized that immunocompetence may be a key determinant of group size choice and tested this hypothesis in a colonial waterbird, the common tern Sterna hirundo. We used a unique experimental framework, where formation of breeding colonies of different sizes was induced under uniform environmental conditions. For this purpose, different-size patches of attractive nesting substrate (artificial floating rafts) were provided at a single site with limited availability of natural nesting habitat. Colony size was identified as the only significant predictor of both innate (natural antibody-mediated complement activation) and adaptive (immunoglobulin concentrations) immunological traits in the common terns, as more immunocompetent birds settled in larger experimental colonies. In contrast, we found no significant associations between colony size and genetic diversity of key pathogen-recognition receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) or genome-wide heterozygosity. We conclude that settlement decisions may be flexible within individuals and, thus, are likely to be primarily determined by the current immunological status, rather than fixed immunogenetic traits. Our study sheds new light on the complex interface between immunity and sociality in animals.","[Drzewinska-Chanko, Joanna; Wlodarczyk, Radoslaw; Minias, Piotr] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Biodivers Studies & Bioeduc, Lodz, Poland; [Gajewski, Adrian] Med Univ Lodz, Dept Immunol & Allergy, Lodz, Poland; [Rudnicka, Karolina] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Immunol & Infect Biol, Lodz, Poland; [Dunn, Peter O.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Sci, Behav & Mol Ecol Grp, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Lodz; Medical University Lodz; University of Lodz; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Minias, P (corresponding author), Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Biodivers Studies & Bioeduc, Lodz, Poland.",pminias@op.pl,"Dunn, Peter O/A-9784-2008; Rudnicka, Karolina/HZJ-3797-2023; W?odarczyk, Rados?aw/HSG-0770-2023","Rudnicka, Karolina/0000-0002-3412-9000; W?odarczyk, Rados?aw/0000-0001-5932-0226; Gajewski, Adrian/0000-0001-7445-9752; Dunn, Peter/0000-0002-7450-4194; Drzewinska-Chanko, Joanna/0000-0001-5641-5254; Minias, Piotr/0000-0002-7742-6750",Narodowe Centrum Nauki [2016/23/B/NZ8/02374],"Narodowe Centrum Nauki(National Science Centre, Poland)","Narodowe Centrum Nauki, Grant/Award Number: 2016/23/B/NZ8/02374",,61,6,6,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Lead levels in blood were correlated with progress of the moose hunting season. Based on analyses of tracking data, we found that even sublethal lead concentrations in blood (25 ppb, wet weight), can likely negatively affect movement behavior (flight height and movement rate) of free ranging scavenging Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). Lead levels in liver of recovered post-mortem analyzed eagles suggested that sublethal exposure increases the risk of mortality in eagles. Such adverse effects on animals are probably common worldwide and across species, where game hunting with lead-based ammunition is widespread. Our study highlights lead exposure as a considerably more serious threat to wildlife conservation than previously realized and suggests implementation of bans of lead ammunition for hunting.","[Ecke, Frauke; Singh, Navinder J.; Arnemo, Jon M.; Nordstrom, Ake; Hornfeldt, Birger] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Ecke, Frauke] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, Box 7050, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Arnemo, Jon M.] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Forestry & Wildlife Management, Campus Evenstad, NO-2480 Koppang, Norway; [Bignert, Anders; Helander, Bjorn; Raikkonen, Jannikke] Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Dept Environm Res & Monitoring, Box 50007, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Bignert, Anders] Tongji Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Berglund, Asa M.

Following acute exposure to two widely used agricultural insecticides, imidacloprid (neonicotinoid) and chlorpyrifos (organophosphate), we compared effects on body mass, migratory activity and orientation in a seed-eating bird, the white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys). During spring migration, sparrows were captured, held and dosed by gavage daily for 3 days with either the vehicle control, low (10% LD50) or high (25% LD50) doses of imidacloprid or chlorpyrifos and tested in migratory orientation trials pre-exposure, post-exposure and during recovery. Control birds maintained body mass and a seasonally appropriate northward orientation throughout the experiment. Imidacloprid dosed birds exhibited significant declines in fat stores and body mass (mean loss: -17% low, -25% high dose) and failed to orient correctly. Chlorpyrifos had no overt effects on mass but significantly impaired orientation. These results suggest that wild songbirds consuming the equivalent of just four imidacloprid-treated canola seeds or eight chlorpyrifos granules per day over 3 days could suffer impaired condition, migration delays and improper migratory direction, which could lead to increased risk of mortality or lost breeding opportunity.","[Eng, Margaret L.] Univ Saskatchewan, Toxicol Ctr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B3, Canada; [Stutchbury, Bridget J.

We examined the impacts of EE2 on zebrafish behavioral and physiological responses through the novel tank test (NTT), which measures anxiety-like behavior; the mirror-induced aggression (MIA) test, which measures aggressiveness; and the social preference test (SPT), which measures social cohesion. The steroid hormone levels were also measured. Here, we show that exposure to EE2 impairs stress responses by regulating the levels of specific hormones and eliciting an anxiolytic response, increasing aggression, and reducing social preference in zebrafish. In nature, these changes in behavior compromise reproduction and anti-predator behaviors, which, in turn, affects species survival. The maintenance of an intact behavioral repertoire in zebrafish is essential for their survival. Thus, our results point to the danger of environmental contamination with EE2 as it may alter the dynamics of the prey-predator relationship.","[Fenske, Lurian; Concato, Ani Carla; de Oliveira Sofiatti, Jessica Reis; Treichel, Helen; Kaizer, Rosilene R.] Univ Fed Fronteira Sul, Programa Posgrad Ciencia & Tecnol Ambiental, Rodovia RS 135,Km 72, BR-99700970 Erechim, RS, Brazil; [Concato, Ani Carla; Vanin, Ana Paula; Tamagno, Wagner Antonio; Kaizer, Rosilene R.] Inst Fed Educ Ciencia & Tecnol Rio Grande do Sul, Campus Sertao,Rodovia RS 135,Km 25, BR-99170000 Sertao, RS, Brazil; [Santos da Rosa, Joao Gabriel] UniSociesc, Curso Med Vet, Blumenau, Brazil; [Gil Barcellos, Leonardo Jose] Univ Fed Santa Maria UFSM, Programa Posgrad Farmacol, Av Roraima 1000,Cidade Univ, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Gil Barcellos, Leonardo Jose] Univ Passo Fundo UPF, Curso Med Vet, BR 285, BR-99052900 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil; [Gil Barcellos, Leonardo Jose] Univ Passo Fundo UPF, Programa Posgrad Bioexpt, BR 285, BR-99052900 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil; [Gil Barcellos, Leonardo Jose] Univ Passo Fundo UPF, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Ambientais, BR 285, BR-99052900 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal da Fronteira Sul; Instituto Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (IFRS); Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Universidade de Passo Fundo; Universidade de Passo Fundo; Universidade de Passo Fundo,"Kaizer, RR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fronteira Sul, Programa Posgrad Ciencia & Tecnol Ambiental, Rodovia RS 135,Km 72, BR-99700970 Erechim, RS, Brazil.;Kaizer, RR (corresponding author), Inst Fed Educ Ciencia & Tecnol Rio Grande do Sul, Campus Sertao,Rodovia RS 135,Km 25, BR-99170000 Sertao, RS, Brazil.",rosilene.perin@sertao.ifrs.edu.br,"Tamagno, Wagner/AFG-5547-2022; Treichel, Helen/A-7302-2016","Tamagno, Wagner/0000-0002-6410-3207; Barcellos, Leonardo/0000-0002-4637-3377; Treichel, Helen/0000-0002-3810-3000","CNPq; FAPERGS; CAPES; Federal University of Fronteira Sul; Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rio Grande do Sul; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS) [18/2551-0000493-6, 19/2551-0001-873-8]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [303263/2018-0]","CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPERGS(Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS)); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Federal University of Fronteira Sul; Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rio Grande do Sul; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS)(Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ))","This study was supported by CNPq, FAPERGS, CAPES, the Federal University of Fronteira Sul, and the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rio Grande do Sul.

Moreover, due to recent technological and computational advances, scientists are now increasingly aware that a wide variety of contaminants and other environmental stressors adversely affect organismal behavior and subsequent ecological outcomes in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. There is also a groundswell of concern that regulatory ecotoxicology does not adequately consider behavior, primarily due to a lack of standardized toxicity methods. This has, in turn, led to the exclusion of many behavioral ecotoxicology studies from chemical risk assessments. To improve understanding of the challenges and opportunities for behavioral ecotoxicology within regulatory toxicology/risk assessment, a unique workshop with international representatives from the fields of behavioral ecology, ecotoxicology, regulatory (eco)toxicology, neurotoxicology, test standardization, and risk assessment resulted in the formation of consensus perspectives and recommendations, which promise to serve as a roadmap to advance interfaces among the basic and translational sciences, and regulatory practices.","[Agerstrand, Marlene] Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Brooks, Bryan W.] Baylor Univ, Inst Biomed Studies, Dept Environm Sci, Waco, TX 76706 USA; [Brooks, Bryan W.] Jinan Univ, Sch Environm, Guangdong Key Lab Environm Pollut & Hlth, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Allen, Joel; Lazorchak, James M.] US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA; [Bertram, Michael G.; Brodin, Tomas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Umea, Sweden; [Dang, ZhiChao; Smit, Els] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm RIVM, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Duquesne, Sabine; Sahm, Rene; Jacob, Stefanie; Mohr, Silvia; Maack, Gerd] German Environm Agcy UBA, Dessau, Germany; [Hoffmann, Frauke] German Fed Inst Risk Assessment, Dept Chem & Prod Safety, Berlin, Germany; [Hollert, Henner] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Kluever, Nils] Environm Res Ctr UFZ, Leipzig, Germany; [Ledesma, Mariana; Scholz, Stefan] Swedish Chem Agcy KemI, Sundbyberg, Stockholms Lan, Sweden; [Melvin, Steven D.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Southport, Qld, Australia; [Padilla, Stephanie] US EPA, Ctr Computat Toxicol & Exposure, Durham, NC USA; [Pyle, Gregory G.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Biol Sci, Lethbridge, AB, Canada; [Saaristo, Minna] Environm Protect Author Victoria EPA, Carlton, Vic, Australia; [Steevens, Jeffery A.] US Geol Survey, Columbia Environm Res Ctr, Columbia, MO 65201 USA; [van den Berg, Sanne] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kloas, Werner] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Berlin, Germany; [Wong, Bob B.

Pesticide exposure is a potential factor in the loss of foragers. During 2009-2010, we assessed changes in the field force populations of 9-10 colonies at one location per crop on each of the eight crops by counting departing foragers leaving colonies at regular intervals during the respective crop blooming periods. The number of frames of adult bees was counted before and after bloom period. For pesticide analysis, we collected dead and dying bees near the hives, returning foragers, crop flowers, trapped pollen, and corn-flowers associated with the cotton crop. The number of departing foragers changed over time in all crops except almonds; general patterns in foraging activity included declines (cotton), noticeable peaks and declines (alfalfa, blueberries, cotton, corn, and pumpkins), and increases (apples and cantaloupes). The number of adult bee frames increased or remained stable in all crops except alfalfa and cotton. A total of 53 different pesticide residues were identified in samples collected across eight crops. Hazard quotients (HQ) were calculated for the combined residues for all crop-associated samples and separately for samples of dead and dying bees. A decrease in the number of departing foragers in cotton was one of the most substantial crop-associated impacts and presented the highest pesticide risk estimated by a summed pesticide residue HQ.","[Frazier, Maryann T.; Mullin, Chris A.; Frazier, Jim L.; Ashcraft, Sara A.] Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, Ctr Pollinator Res, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Leslie, Tim W.] Long Isl Univ, Dept Biol, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Mussen, Eric C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Drummond, Frank A.] Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Orono, ME 04469 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Long Island University-Brooklyn Campus; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Frazier, MT (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, Ctr Pollinator Res, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",mfrazier@psu.edu,,,National Honey Board,National Honey Board,"We would like to thank the beekeepers who helped develop this proposal and allowed us to use their bees for the project: Dave Hackenberg, Dave Mendez, Tory Bunch, Gene Brandi, Bob Miller, and Orin Johnson.

High levels of the 'social hormone' testosterone (T) are linked to aggression, dominance, and competition. Low T levels, in contrast, promote sociopositive behaviours such as affiliation, social tolerance, and cooperation, which can be crucial for group-level, collective behaviours. Here, we test the hypothesis that - in a collective context - low T levels should be favourable, using non-reproductive male and female stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and non-invasive waterbome hormone analysis. In line with our predictions, we show that the fishes' T levels were significantly lower during shoaling compared to when alone, with high-T individuals showing the largest decrease. Ruling out stress-induced T suppression and increased T conversion into oestradiol, we find evidence that shoaling directly affects androgen responsiveness. We also show that groups characterized by lower mean T exhibit less hierarchical leader-follower dynamics, suggesting that low T promotes egalitarianism. Overall, we show that collective action results in lower T levels, which may serve to promote coordination and group performance. Our study, together with recent complementary findings in humans, emphasizes the importance of low T for the expression of sociopositive behaviour across vertebrates, suggesting similarities in endocrine mechanisms.","[Furtbauer, Ines] Swansea Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biosci, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Furtbauer, Ines] Univ Cape Town, Inst Communities & Wildlife Africa, Dept Biol Sci, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Brown, M.

However, these beachings occur for reasons that are not fully understood. In 2016, 124 LFPW were stranded on the Chilean Patagonian islands, offering a unique opportunity to obtain crucial information on the ecology, biology, and genetics of this population. In addition, we examined whether persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and trace elements (TEs) were responsible for this mass mortality. Stable isotopes (delta C-13 & delta N-15) and genetic analyses were used to reconstruct the trophic ecology, social structure, and kinship of LFPW and compared to POPs and TEs levels found in LFPW. Mitochondrial DNA analyses on 71 individuals identified four maternal lineages within the stranded LFPW. Of these animals, 32 individuals were analyzed for a suite of POPs, TEs, and lipid content in blubber. The highest levels were found for SDDXs (6 isomers) (542.46 +/- 433.46 ng/g, lw) and for total Hg (2.79 +/- 1.91 mg/kg, dw). However, concentrations found in these LFPW were lower than toxicity thresholds and those reported for LFPW stranded in other regions. Evidence was found of SDDX, S7PCBs, and Cd bioaccumulation and maternal transfer of POPs in mother/offspring groups. Nevertheless, no clear relationship between contaminant concentrations and LFPW mortality was established. Further research is still needed to assess LFPW populations including conservations status and exposure to chemicals in remote areas such as Patagonia. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Bees contribute approximately 80% of insect pollination, so it is important to understand and mitigate the causes of current declines in bee populations(4-6). Recent studies have implicated the role of pesticides in these declines, as exposure to these chemicals has been associated with changes in bee behaviour(7-11) and reductions in colony queen production(12). However, the key link between changes in individual behaviour and the consequent impact at the colony level has not been shown. Social bee colonies depend on the collective performance of many individual workers. Thus, although field-level pesticide concentrations can have subtle or sublethal effects at the individual level(8), it is not known whether bee societies can buffer such effects or whether it results in a severe cumulative effect at the colony level. Furthermore, widespread agricultural intensification means that bees are exposed to numerous pesticides when foraging(13-15), yet the possible combinatorial effects of pesticide exposure have rarely been investigated(16,17). Here we show that chronic exposure of bumblebees to two pesticides (neonicotinoid and pyrethroid) at concentrations that could approximate field-level exposure impairs natural foraging behaviour and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success. We found that worker foraging performance, particularly pollen collecting efficiency, was significantly reduced with observed knock-on effects for forager recruitment, worker losses and overall worker productivity. Moreover, we provide evidence that combinatorial exposure to pesticides increases the propensity of colonies to fail.","[Gill, Richard J.; Ramos-Rodriguez, Oscar; Raine, Nigel E.] Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Gill, RJ (corresponding author), Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",richard.gill@rhul.ac.uk; nigel.raine@rhul.ac.uk,"Raine, Nigel/AAK-6425-2020","Raine, Nigel/0000-0001-6343-2829; Gill, Richard/0000-0001-9389-1284","Insect Pollinator Initiative; Living with Environmental Change programme, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Wellcome Trust; Scottish Government; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [BB/I000178/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I000178/1] Funding Source: researchfish; BBSRC [BB/I000178/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Insect Pollinator Initiative; Living with Environmental Change programme, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Scottish Government; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC))","We thank M.J.F.

The effects of moderate and high exposure to Pb have been well-studied in birds, but whether low-level early-life exposure to Pb influences adult phenotype remains unclear. Female songbirds use a male's song and coloration to discriminate between high- and low-quality males. Therefore, if early-life exposure to Pb disrupts song learning ability or shifts the allocation of antioxidant pigments away from colorful secondary sexual traits, male birds exposed to Pb may be less attractive to females. We exposed developing zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to Pb-contaminated drinking water (100 or 1000 parts per billion [ppb]) after hatching (days 0-100). Once male finches reached adulthood (120-150 days post hatch), we measured song learning ability, coloration of bill and cheek patches, and volume of song nuclei in the brain. We also measured female preference for Pb-exposed males relative to control males. Finally, we measured motoric and spatial cognitive performance in male and female finches to assess whether cognitive traits differed in their sensitivity to Pb exposure. Male zebra finches exposed to 1000 ppb Pb had impaired song learning ability, reduced volume of song nuclei, bills with less redness and received less attention from females. Additionally, Pb exposure impaired motoric performance in both male and female finches but did not affect performance in a spatial cognitive task. Adult finches exposed to Pb-contaminated water had higher blood-Pb levels, though in all cases blood-Pb levels were below 7.0 mu g dL(-1). This study suggests that low-level exposure to Pb contributes to cognitive deficits that persist into adulthood and may indirectly influence fitness by altering secondary sexual traits and reducing male attractiveness.","[Goodchild, Christopher G.; Beck, Michelle L.; VanDiest, Isaac; Czesak, Frankie N.; Lane, Samuel J.; Sewall, Kendra B.] Virgina Tech, Dept Biol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Goodchild, Christopher G.] Univ Cent Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Edmond, OK USA; [Beck, Michelle L.] Rivier Univ, Dept Biol, Nashua, NH USA",University of Central Oklahoma,"Goodchild, CG (corresponding author), Virgina Tech, Dept Biol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",cgoodchild@uco.edu,,"Lane, Samuel/0000-0002-0893-3572; Sewall, Kendra/0000-0002-9347-5878; Czesak, Francesca/0000-0001-9470-6888",Virginia Tech Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science,Virginia Tech Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science,We acknowledge funding support from Virginia Tech Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science.,,128,8,8,2,22,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-6513,1090-2414,,ECOTOX ENVIRON SAFE,Ecotox.

Objective: To provide a comprehensive analysis of all regulatory compliant aquatic ecotoxicity data and evaluate the current triggers and effects-based environmental assessments to facilitate the development of more efficient approaches for pharmaceuticals toxicity testing. Methods: Publicly-available regulatory compliant ecotoxicity data for drugs targeting human proteins was compiled together with pharmacological information including drug targets, Cmax and lipophilicity. Possible links between these factors and the ecotoxicity data for effects on, growth, mortality and/or reproduction, were evaluated. The environmental risks were then assessed based on a combined analysis of drug toxicity and predicted environmental concentrations based on European patient consumption data. Results: For most (88%) of the of 975 approved small molecule drugs targeting human proteins a complete set of regulatory compliant ecotoxicity data in the public domain was lacking, highlighting the need for both intelligent approaches to prioritize legacy human drugs for a tailored environmental risk assessment and a transparent database that captures environmental data. We show that presence/absence of drug-target orthologues are predictive of susceptible species for the more potent drugs. Drugs that target the endocrine system represent the highest potency and greatest risk. However, for most drugs ( > 80%) with a full set of ecotoxicity data, risk quotients assuming worst-case exposure assessments were below one in all European countries indicating low environmental risks for the endpoints assessed. Conclusion: We believe that the presented analysis can guide improvements to current testing procedures, and provide valuable approaches for prioritising legacy drugs (i.e. those registered before 2006) for further ecotoxicity testing. For drugs where effects of possible concern (e.g. behaviour) are not captured in regulatory tests, additional mechanistic testing may be required to provide the highest confidence for avoiding environmental impacts.","[Gunnarsson, Lina; Verbruggen, Bas; Tyler, Charles R.] Univ Exeter, Biosci, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4QD, Devon, England; [Snapk, Jason R.; Owen, Stewart F.; Hutchinson, Kathryn] AstraZeneca, Global Environm, Alderley Pk, Macclesfield SK10 4TF, Cheshire, England; [Snapk, Jason R.] Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Gibbet Hill Campus, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Kristiansson, Erik; Osterlund, Tobias] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Math Sci, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Kristiansson, Erik; Osterlund, Tobias] Univ Gothenburg, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Margiotta-Casaluci, Luigi] Brunel Univ London, Inst Environm Hlth & Soc, London UB8 3PH, England; [Leverett, Dean; Marks, Becky] WCA, Brunel House,Volunteer Way, Faringdon SN7 7YR, Oxon, England",University of Exeter; AstraZeneca; University of Warwick; Chalmers University of Technology; University of Gothenburg; Brunel University,"Tyler, CR (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Geoffrey Pope Bldg,Stocker Rd, Exeter EX4 4QD, Devon, England.",C.R.Tyler@exeter.ac.ux,"Kristiansson, Erik/JHS-8257-2023; Owen, Stewart/ABF-1216-2021; Margiotta-Casaluci, Luigi/A-5402-2011","Margiotta-Casaluci, Luigi/0000-0001-6938-0396; Owen, Stewart/0000-0003-1398-7142",AstraZeneca Global SHE Research Programme; Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) Joint Undertaking under 'Intelligence-led Assessment of Pharmaceuticals in the Environment' (iPiE) [115735]; EU; European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA); AstraZeneca [102519]; NERC [NE/K004263/1] Funding Source: UKRI,AstraZeneca Global SHE Research Programme; Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) Joint Undertaking under 'Intelligence-led Assessment of Pharmaceuticals in the Environment' (iPiE); EU(European Union (EU)); European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA); AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The work of the authors is supported by the following institutes, organisations and grants: (1) AstraZeneca Global SHE Research Programme grant to C.R.T.; (2) the research leading to these results has received support from the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) Joint Undertaking under 'Intelligence-led Assessment of Pharmaceuticals in the Environment' (iPiE) grant agreement no 115735, resources of which are composed of financial contribution from the EU's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) companies in kind contribution.

Exposures can influence prey-predator interactions, courtship and other vital behaviors, leading to individual or population disruption at toxicant levels well below those producing morphological or physiological changes. The few behavioral studies of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on fish behavior have yielded highly inconsistent results, likely relating to chronic vs. acute treatment. A few studies report lethargy and decreased exploratory behavior, while others indicate increased anxiety and greater exploratory behavior with PAH exposure. In our study on zebrafish (Danio rerio), we hypothesized that even relatively brief (30 min) exposure to the PAH benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) would impact group shoaling and individual behaviors in open field and novel object exploration tests. Exposures comprised measured concentrations of 1.0 pM, 10 pM, or 100 pM, B[a]P. Compared to controls, inter-individual distance (IID) was significantly increased by 100 pM B[a]P, but not by 1.0 pM or 10 pM B[a]P. Total distance moved by shoals was decreased significantly at B[a]P concentrations of 1.0 pM, 10 pM and 100 pM. In the open field test of individual locomotion and anxiety-like behavior, time spent in the thigmotaxis zone along the walls of the circular test arena (a proxy for anxiety-like behavior), was decreased at 100 pM. In the novel object approach test to investigate boldness, time spent near the object was significantly increased by both 10 pM and 100 pM B[a]P. Collectively, these data indicate a complex suite of changes in zebrafish including altered shoal dynamics, decreased anxiety, increased boldness, and decreased locomotion associated with exposure to B[a]P.

Altered movement behavior and preference for methamphetamine during withdrawal were linked to drug residues in fish brain tissues and accompanied by brain metabolome changes. Our results suggest that emission of illicit drugs into freshwater ecosystems causes addiction in fish and modifies habitat preferences with unexpected adverse consequences of relevance at the individual and population levels.

Fish are chronically exposed to pollution at low concentrations. The changes of aggressive behaviour of chub (Squalius cephalus) were determined under the exposure to four psychoactive compounds (sertraline, citalopram, tramadol, methamphetamine) at environmentally relevant concentrations of 1 mu g/L for 42 days. We tested whether (A) the behavioural effect of compounds varies within a single species; (B) there is a correlation between the individual brain concentration of the tested pollutants and fish aggression using the novel analysis of pollutants in brain; and (C) there is detectable threshold to effective pollutant concentration in brain. Behaviour and pollutant concentrations in brain were determined repeatedly (1st, 7th, 21st, 42nd and 56th days), including a two-week-long depuration period. The effect of particular compounds varied. Citalopram and methamphetamine generally increased the fish aggression, while no such effect was found after exposure to tramadol or sertraline. The longitudinal analysis showed an aggression increase after depuration, indicating the presence of withdrawal effects in methamphetamine- and tramadol-exposed fish. The analysis of pollutant concentration in brain revealed a positive linear relationship of citalopram concentration and aggression, while no such effect was detected for other compounds and/or their metabolites. Structural break analyses detected concentration thresholds of citalopram (1 and 3 ng/g) and sertraline (1000 ng/g) in brain tissue, from which a significant effect on behaviour was manifested. While the effect of sertraline was not detected using traditional approaches, there was a reduction in aggression after considering its threshold concentration in the brain. Our results suggest that pursuing the concentration threshold of psychoactive compounds can help to reduce false negative results and provide more realistic predictions on behavioural outcomes in freshwater environments, especially in the case of compounds with bioaccumulation potential such as sertraline.","[Huben, Pavla; Horky, Pavel; Douda, Karel; Slavfk, Ondrej] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Zool & Fisheries, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Grabic, Roman; Grabicov, Katerina; Randak, Tomas] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Fisheries & Protect Waters, South Bohemian Res Ctr Aquaculture & Biodivers Hy, Zatisi 728-II, Vodnany 39825, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Huben, P (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Zool & Fisheries, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",hubena@af.czu.cz,"HorkÏ, Pavel/A-3857-2013; Douda, Karel/D-4759-2011; Grabic, Roman/AAF-5412-2021; Randak, Tomas/G-1798-2015; Grabicova, Katerina/F-7921-2015","HorkÏ, Pavel/0000-0002-1738-7753; Douda, Karel/0000-0002-7778-5147; Grabic, Roman/0000-0002-0935-2075; Randak, Tomas/0000-0003-0462-266X; Hubena, Pavla/0000-0001-6351-6395; Grabicova, Katerina/0000-0002-6026-6260",,,,,122,11,11,5,31,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-6513,1090-2414,,ECOTOX ENVIRON SAFE,Ecotox.

Despite increasing evidence that highlights their importance [5-16], we still lack a unified mechanistic framework to explain and to predict how consistent inter-individual differences may drive collective behavior. Here we investigate how the structure, leadership, movement dynamics, and foraging performance of groups can emerge from inter-individual differences by high-resolution tracking of known behavioral types in free-swimming stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) shoals. We show that individual's propensity to stay near others, measured by a classic sociability'' assay, was negatively linked to swim speed across a range of contexts, and predicted spatial positioning and leadership within groups as well as differences in structure and movement dynamics between groups. In turn, this trait, together with individual's exploratory tendency, measured by a classic boldness'' assay, explained individual and group foraging performance. These effects of consistent individual differences on group-level states emerged naturally from a generic model of self-organizing groups composed of individuals differing in speed and goal-orientedness. Our study provides experimental and theoretical evidence for a simple mechanism to explain the emergence of collective behavior from consistent individual differences, including variation in the structure, leadership, movement dynamics, and functional capabilities of groups, across social and ecological scales. In addition, we demonstrate individual performance is conditional on group composition, indicating how social selection may drive behavioral differentiation between individuals.","[Jolles, Jolle W.; Boogert, Neeltje J.; Manica, Andrea] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3DT, England; [Jolles, Jolle W.; Sridhar, Vivek H.; Couzin, Iain D.] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Collect Behav, Obstberg 1, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Jolles, Jolle W.; Sridhar, Vivek H.; Couzin, Iain D.] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Univ Str 10, D-78464 Constance, Germany; [Boogert, Neeltje J.] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England",University of Cambridge; Max Planck Society; University of Konstanz; University of Exeter,"Jolles, JW (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3DT, England.;Jolles, JW (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Collect Behav, Obstberg 1, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany.;Jolles, JW (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Univ Str 10, D-78464 Constance, Germany.",j.w.jolles@gmail.com,"Jolles, Jolle Wolter/E-9842-2011; Couzin, Iain D./Q-6862-2018; Manica, Andrea/B-5497-2008; Manica, Andrea/N-9013-2019","Jolles, Jolle Wolter/0000-0001-9905-2633; Couzin, Iain D./0000-0001-8556-4558; Manica, Andrea/0000-0003-1895-450X; Sridhar, Vivek Hari/0000-0001-6658-2232","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour; Royal Society; National Science Foundation [IOS-1355061, EAGER-IOS-1251585]; Office of Naval Research [N00014-09-1-1074, N00014-14-1-0635]; Army Research Office [W911NG-11-1-0385, W911NF-14-1-0431]; Human Frontier Science Program [RGP0065/2012]; Struktur- und Innovationsfonds fur die Forschung of the state Baden-Wurttenberg (SI-BW); Max Planck Society; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [1221583] Funding Source: researchfish; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems; Direct For Biological Sciences [1355061] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour; Royal Society(Royal Society); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); Army Research Office; Human Frontier Science Program(Human Frontier Science Program); Struktur- und Innovationsfonds fur die Forschung of the state Baden-Wurttenberg (SI-BW); Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS)),"We thank Lucy Aplin, Damien Farine, Matt Grobis, Rufus Johnstone, Jelle Jolles, Kate Laskowski, Mate e Nagy, Mike Webster, and Peter Winsberger for discussions or comments on the manuscript, and Ben Walbanke-Taylor for logistical support.

Considerable research has focused on understanding how animal groups form and function, including how collective behaviour emerges via self-organising mechanisms and how phenotypic variation drives the behaviour and functioning of animal groups. However, we still lack a mechanistic understanding of the role of phenotypic variation in collective animal behaviour. Here we present a common framework to quantify individual heterogeneity and synthesise the literature to systematically explain and predict its role in collective behaviour across species, contexts, and traits. We show that individual heterogeneity provides a key intermediary mechanism with broad consequences for sociality (e.g., group structure, functioning), ecology (e.g., response to environmental change), and evolution. We also outline a roadmap for future research.","[Jolles, Jolle W.] Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Collect Behav, D-78464 Constance, Germany; [Jolles, Jolle W.] Univ Konstanz, Ctr Adv Study Collect Behav, D-78464 Constance, Germany; [Jolles, Jolle W.] Univ Konstanz, Zukunftskolleg, D-78464 Constance, Germany; [King, Andrew J.] Swansea Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biosci, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [King, Andrew J.] Univ Cape Town, Inst Communities & Wildlife Africa, Dept Biol Sci, Cape Town, South Africa; [Killen, Shaun S.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Graham Kerr Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",Max Planck Society; University of Konstanz; University of Konstanz; Swansea University; University of Cape Town; University of Glasgow,"Jolles, JW (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Collect Behav, D-78464 Constance, Germany.;Jolles, JW (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Ctr Adv Study Collect Behav, D-78464 Constance, Germany.;Jolles, JW (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Zukunftskolleg, D-78464 Constance, Germany.",j.w.jolles@gmail.com,"king, Andrew/JJF-7846-2023; Jolles, Jolle Wolter/E-9842-2011","Jolles, Jolle Wolter/0000-0001-9905-2633",Alexander von Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellowship; Zukunftskolleg Postdoctoral Fellowship; NERC [NE/J019100/1]; European Research Council [640004]; NERC [NE/J019100/1] Funding Source: UKRI; European Research Council (ERC) [640004] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Alexander von Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellowship(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Zukunftskolleg Postdoctoral Fellowship; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),We thank Iain Couzin and members of the Department of Collective Behaviour at theMax Planck Institute of Animal Behavior for insightful discussion and two anonymous referees for valuable comments on a previous version of the manuscript.

Male fishes downstream of some wastewater out falls produce vitellogenin (VTG) (a protein normally synthesized by females during oocyte maturation) and early-stage eggs in their testes, and this feminization has been attributed to the presence of estrogenic substances such as natural estrogens [estrone or 17 beta-estradiol (E2)], the synthetic estrogen used in birth-control pills [17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2)], or weaker estrogen mimics such as nonylphenol in the water. Despite widespread evidence that male fishes are being feminized, it is not known whether these low-level, chronic exposures adversely impact the sustainability of wild populations. We conducted a 7-year, wholelake experiment at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in northwestern Ontario, Canada, and showed that chronic exposure of fathead minnow (Pimephalespromelas) to low concentrations (5-6 ng-L-1) of the potent 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol led to feminization of males through the production of vitellogenin mRNA and protein, impacts on gonadal development as evidenced by intersex in males and altered oogenesis in females, and, ultimately, a near extinction of this species from the lake. Our observations demonstrate that the concentrations of estrogens and their mimics observed in freshwaters can impact the sustainability of wild fish populations.","Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Freshwater, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N6, Canada; US EPA, Mol Indicators Res Branch, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA",Fisheries & Oceans Canada; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Kidd, KA (corresponding author), Univ New Brunswick, Canadian Rivers Inst, St John, NB E2E 4P1, Canada.",kiddk@unbsj.ca,"Kidd, Karen/ABG-3237-2020; Palace, Vince/AHB-6708-2022; Mills, Kingston/F-5684-2013; Lazorchak, James/E-2363-2016","Kidd, Karen/0000-0002-5619-1358; Mills, Kingston/0000-0003-3646-8222; Lazorchak, James/0000-0002-7354-7571; Blanchfield, Paul/0000-0003-0886-5642",,,,,30,1477,1745,22,1129,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Comparative studies of social buffering: A consideration of approaches, terminology, and pitfalls...NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV XXX-XXX,. - Over the past decades, there has been an increasing number of investigations of the impact of social variables on neural, endocrine, and immune outcomes. Among these are studies of social buffering or the phenomenon by which affiliative social partners mitigate the response to stressors. Yet, as social buffering studies have become more commonplace, the variety of approaches taken, definitions employed, and divergent results obtained in different species can lead to confusion and miscommunication. The aim of the present paper, therefore, is to address terminology and approaches and to highlight potential pitfalls to the study of social buffering across nonhuman species. We review and categorize variables currently being employed in social buffering studies and provide an overview of responses measured, mediating sensory modalities and underlying mechanisms. It is our hope that the paper will be useful to those contemplating examination of social buffering in the context of their own research.","[Kiyokawa, Yasushi] Univ Tokyo, Lab Vet Ethol, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Hennessy, Michael B.] Wright State Univ, Dept Psychol, 335 Fawcett Hall, Dayton, OH 45435 USA",University of Tokyo; University System of Ohio; Wright State University Dayton,"Kiyokawa, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Lab Vet Ethol, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",akiyo@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp; michael.hennessy@wright.edu,"Hennessy, Michael/AAH-9642-2019","Kiyokawa, Yasushi/0000-0002-4335-1404","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [15H05635, 15H05782]; United States National Institute of Mental Health [MH68228]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H05635] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); United States National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (grant numbers 15H05635 and 15H05782) and by the United States National Institute of Mental Health (MH68228).,,154,78,84,4,53,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0149-7634,1873-7528,,NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV R,Neurosci.

To end neglect of pollution and advance prevention of pollution-related disease, we formed the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health. Despite recent gains in understanding of pollution and its health effects, this Commission noted that large gaps in knowledge remain. To close these gaps and guide prevention, the Commission made research recommendations and proposed creation of a Global Observatory on Pollution and Health. We posit that successful pollution research will he translational and based on transdisciplinary collaborations among exposure science, epidemiology, data science, engineering, health policy, and economics. We envision that the Global Observatory on Pollution and Health will be a multinational consortium based at Boston College and the Harvard T.H.

Social insect colonies navigate this challenge, in the absence of centralized control, by allocating different individuals to exploration or exploitation based on variation in individual behaviour. To investigate how heritable differences in individual learning affect a colony's collective ability to locate and choose among different quality food resources, we develop an agent-based model and test its predictions empirically using two genetic lines of honey bees (Apis mellifera), selected for differences in their learning behaviour. We show that colonies containing individuals that are better at learning to ignore unrewarding stimuli are worse at collectively choosing the highest-quality resource. This work highlights how differences in individual behaviour may have unexpected consequences for the emergence of collective behaviour. (c) 2021 The Authors.

However, there has been no large-scale, generalizable study on their impact on biodiversity of avian species in the United States. Here we show, using a rich dataset on breeding birds and pesticide use in the United States, that the increase in neonicotinoid use led to statistically significant reductions in bird biodiversity between 2008 and 2014 relative to a counterfactual without neonicotinoid use, particularly for grassland and insectivorous birds, with average annual rates of reduction of 4% and 3%, respectively. The corresponding rates are even higher (12% and 5%, respectively) when the dynamic effects of bird population declines on future population growth are considered. The effects of neonicotinoids on non-grassland and non-insectivorous birds are also statistically significant but smaller, with an average annual rate of reduction of 2% over this period. Neonicotinoid insecticides have the potential to harm non-target organisms. This study finds that, between 2008 and 2014, increased neonicotinoid use in the United States reduced bird diversity, especially grassland and insectivorous birds.","[Li, Yijia; Khanna, Madhu] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Miao, Ruiqing] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Khanna, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",khanna1@illinois.edu,,"Li, Yijia/0000-0002-9018-6536; Miao, Ruiqing/0000-0003-2936-6105","NIFA, USDA","NIFA, USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","We thank NIFA, USDA for hatch funding for this research.

To investigate its long-term effects at environmentally relevant levels, we evaluated heart rate (HR) and locomotion of signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus during a 21-day exposure to 1 mu g L-1 tramadol followed by 14 days depuration. Locomotion and HR were recorded over a period 30 min before and 30 min after exposure to physiological fluids of an injured conspecific, a natural stressor, four times during the tramadol exposure and four times during depuration. A significant increase in HR following stress induction was found in the majority of tramadol-exposed and control crayfish, as well as significant group-specific HR changes between both groups. Locomotor activity during tramadol treatment differed from that during depuration, in general showing less time spent in locomotion and lower distance moved.

One explanation for this variation is that individuals face differential benefits or costs depending on the group's order, but empirical evidence for this is lacking. Here we show that in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), fish that are first to respond to an ephemeral food source do so faster when shoals are in a disordered, swarm-like state. This is because individuals' visual fields collectively cover more of their environment, meaning private information is more readily available in disordered groups. Once social information becomes available, however, the arrival times of subsequent group members to the food are faster in more ordered, polarized groups. Our data further suggest that first responding individuals (those that benefit from group disorder) maintain larger differences in heading angle to their nearest neighbours when shoaling, thereby explaining how conflict over whether private or social information is favoured can drive dynamic changes in collective behaviour.","[MacGregor, Hannah E.

Mounting evidence suggests that such pollutants can disrupt the behaviour of non-target species. Despite this, few studies have considered how the response of exposed organisms might be mediated by social context. To redress this, we investigated the impacts of two environmentally realistic concentrations of a pervasive antidepressant pollutant, fluoxetine, on foraging behaviour in fish (Gambusia holbrooki), tested individually or in a group. Fluoxetine did not alter behaviour of solitary fish. However, in a group setting, fluoxetine exposure disrupted the frequency of aggressive interactions and food consumption, with observed effects being contingent on both the mean weight of group members and the level of within-group variation in weight. Our results suggest that behavioural tests in social isolation may not accurately predict the environmental risk of chemical pollutants for group-living species and highlight the potential for social context to mediate the effects of psychoactive pollutants in exposed wildlife.","[Martin, Jake M.; Saaristo, Minna; Tan, Hung; Bertram, Michael G.; Nagarajan-Radha, Venkatesh; Dowling, Damian K.; Wong, Bob B.

Particularly concerning are pharmaceutical pollutants that can adversely impact exposed wildlife, even at extremely low concentrations. One such contaminant is the widely prescribed antidepressant fluoxetine, which can disrupt neurotransmission and behavioural pathways in wildlife. Despite this, relatively limited research has addressed the behavioural impacts of fluoxetine at ecologically realistic exposure concentrations. Here, we show that 28-day fluoxetine exposure at two ecologically relevant dosages one representing low surface water concentrations and another representing high effluent flow concentrations alters antipredator behaviour in Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). We found that fluoxetine exposure at the lower dosage resulted in increased activity levels irrespective of the presence or absence of a predatory dragonfly nymph (Hemianax papuensis). Additionally, irrespective of exposure concentration, fluoxetine-exposed fish entered the predator 'strike zone' more rapidly. In a separate experiment, fluoxetine exposure reduced mosquitofish freezing behaviour a common antipredator strategy following a simulated predator strike, although, in females, this reduction in behaviour was seen only at the lower dosage. Together, our findings suggest that fluoxetine can cause both non-monotonic and sex-dependent shifts in behaviour. Further, they demonstrate that exposure to fluoxetine at environmentally realistic concentrations can alter antipredator behaviour, with important repercussions for organismal fitness.

This study aimed to assess the short-term effects of sublethal concentrations of both paracetamol and propranolol on the fish Phalloceros harpagos, specifically light/dark preference, swimming patterns, skin pigmentation, histopathology, and liver glycogen levels. Fish were acutely exposed to sublethal concentrations of both paracetamol (0.008, 0.08, 0.8, 8, 80mgL(-1)) and propranolol (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1mgL(-1)) under controlled conditions. For scototaxis, a significant preference for the dark compartment was observed for the group exposed to the highest concentration of paracetamol (80mgL(-1)). Propranolol exposure significantly altered the swimming pattern, especially in fish exposed to the 0.001mgL(-1) concentration. Pigmentation was reduced in propranolol-exposed fish (0.1, 1mgL(-1)). The lowest concentration of propranolol (0.0001mgL(-1)) induced a decrease of histochemical reaction for hepatic glycogen. These data demonstrate that pharmaceuticals can induce sublethal effects in nontarget organisms, even at low concentrations, compromising specific functions of the individual with ecological relevance, such as energy balance and behavior.","[Matus, Gregorio Nolazco; Pereira, Beatriz V.

It is well known that many species can form and disband groups, often in response to the distribution and abundance of resources. While previous studies showed that resources influence the broad-scale structure of animal groups, knowledge gaps remain on whether they affect fine-scale patterns of association among individuals within groups. We quantify association patterns in African lions while simultaneously monitoring the abundance and distribution of prey. We test how social and ecological factors, including individual trait (age, sex, reproductive state) similarity and prey availability (prey abundance, dispersion, herd size and body size) affect within-pride social structure in African lions. We found that individual decisions about associates depended on resource availability with individuals associating equally across all members of the pride when prey herds were scarce, aggregated or large bodied, and associating more exclusively (in subgroups of preferred associates) when prey herds were abundant, dispersed or small bodied. Individuals within lion prides seemed to be buffering against changes in prey availability by modulating their strength and density of connections with conspecifics when prides split into subgroups. The strength and density of connections among individuals within subgroups was greater when prey herds were large and lower when prey herds were dispersed or are large bodied. Our findings suggest that individual lions are making social decisions at both the subgroup level and the pride level, with decisions representing putatively fitness-enhancing strategies. Individuals were typically shifting between having few strong connections and having many weaker connections depending on prevailing ecological conditions, with prey abundance, dispersion and body size having the greatest impact on decisions about splitting into subgroups. The maintenance of connections within prides and subgroups in the face of ecological change suggests that the fission-fusion nature of lion prides might be essential for the long-term maintenance of social connections even when short-term conditions do not allow them. More broadly, our study reveals how fission-fusion dynamics and ecological factors can simultaneously have an effect on animals across multiple levels of sociality.","[Mbizah, Moreangels M.; Valeix, Marion; Hunt, Jane E.; Macdonald, David W.; Loveridge, Andrew J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit WildCRU, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Oxford, England; [Farine, Damien R.] Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Collect Behav, Constance, Germany; [Farine, Damien R.] Univ Konstanz, Ctr Adv Study Collect Behav, Constance, Germany; [Farine, Damien R.] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Constance, Germany; [Farine, Damien R.] Univ Oxford, Edward Grey Inst, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Valeix, Marion] Univ Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut,UMR 5558, CNRS, Villeurbanne, France; [Valeix, Marion] CNRS, HERD Hwange Environm Res Dev Program, Zone Atelier Hwange, LTSER France, Dete, Zimbabwe",University of Oxford; Max Planck Society; University of Konstanz; University of Konstanz; University of Oxford; VetAgro Sup; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE),"Mbizah, MM (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit WildCRU, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Oxford, England.",moreangelsm@gmail.com,"Farine, Damien R./Y-2454-2019","Farine, Damien R./0000-0003-2208-7613; VALEIX, Marion/0000-0002-9732-1737; Macdonald, David/0000-0003-0607-9373",DFG [FA 1420/41]; Mitsubishi Fund for Europe and Africa; Daimler und Benz foundation; Max Planck Society; International Program for Scientific Cooperation (PICS); Darwin Initiative for Biodiversity Grants; Cecil Fund; Santander; Rufford Maurice Laing; Panthera; Eppley Foundation for Research; SATIB Trust; C.V Starr Foundation; Robertson Foundation; H2020 European Research Council [850859]; Recanati-Kaplan Foundation; University of Oxford; European Research Council (ERC) [850859] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Mitsubishi Fund for Europe and Africa; Daimler und Benz foundation; Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society); International Program for Scientific Cooperation (PICS); Darwin Initiative for Biodiversity Grants; Cecil Fund; Santander; Rufford Maurice Laing; Panthera; Eppley Foundation for Research; SATIB Trust; C.V Starr Foundation; Robertson Foundation; H2020 European Research Council(Horizon 2020European Research Council (ERC)); Recanati-Kaplan Foundation; University of Oxford; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"DFG, Grant/Award Number: FA 1420/41; Mitsubishi Fund for Europe and Africa; Daimler und Benz foundation; Max Planck Society; International Program for Scientific Cooperation (PICS); Jon Cummings; Darwin Initiative for Biodiversity Grants; Cecil Fund; Santander; Rufford Maurice Laing; R.G Frankenberg; Panthera; Eppley Foundation for Research; SATIB Trust; Boesak and Kruger; C.V Starr Foundation; Robertson Foundation; H2020 European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: Grant Number 850859; Recanati-Kaplan Foundation; Riv and Joan Winant; Lady Margaret Hall Col; University of Oxford",,72,13,13,3,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The social environment, however, represents the arena in which individual-level performance shapes group- or population-level outcomes and may therefore mediate many of the ultimate consequences of chemicals for wildlife. Here, we evaluated the role that the social environment plays in determining the consequences of pollutant exposure. We exposed groups of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) to an emerging pharmaceutical pollutant that is commonly detected in freshwaters (the benzodiazepine, oxazepam) and allowed them to form dominance hierarchies. Exposure affected dominant and subordinate fish differently, causing fish to become less aggressive at high doses and subordinate fish to become more competitively successful at low doses. These perturbations had further consequences for growth, fin damage, and survival. Exposure also modulated physiological stress in the hierarchy, and social status itself affected how much oxazepam was absorbed in tissues, potentially creating a dynamic feedback loop that further influences the asymmetric effects of exposure on differing social statuses. Many effects followed a U-shaped dose-response curve, highlighting the importance of nonlinear, low-dose effects. Altogether, we show that social structure in animal groups can interact with and modulate the effects of an environmental contaminant.

However, large-scale exposures are still very rare due to prohibitive costs, the availability of replicated habitats, and the potential for exposure to cause lasting damage to the environment. Here, we evaluated the viability of internal slow-release implants as an alternative method for manipulating CEC exposures in aquatic wildlife using two fat-based carriers (coconut oil and vegetable shortening). We treated roach (Rutilus rutilus) with implants containing a high (50 mu g/g), low (25 mu g/g), or control (0 mu g/g) concentration of the behavior-modifying pharmaceutical oxazepam. We then measured oxazepam uptake in four tissues (plasma, muscle, liver, and the brain) over 1 month. The two carriers released oxazepam differently: coconut oil was the superior implant type because it delivered a more consistent dose across time, while vegetable shortening released oxazepam rapidly at the start of the exposure period. For both carriers and treatments, the brain and liver contained the most oxazepam. Overall, the method is a promising technique for controlled manipulations of pharmaceuticals in fish, and we have provided some of the first data on the suitability and contaminant release kinetics from different implant types.","[McCallum, Erin S.] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [McCallum, Erin S.; Brodin, Tomas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Cerveny, Daniel; Fick, Jerker] Umea Univ, Dept Chem, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Cerveny, Daniel] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Fisheries & Protect Waters, South Bohemian Res Ctr Aquaculture & Biodivers Hy, Res Inst Fish Culture & Hydrobiol, Zatisi 728-2, Vodnany 38925, Czech Republic",Umea University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Umea University; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"McCallum, ES (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.;McCallum, ES (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",erin.mccallum@slu.se,"Cerveny, Daniel/ABE-9683-2021; Cerveny, Daniel/R-4557-2016; Berglund Fick, Jerker/HDO-5788-2022; McCallum, Erin/AAJ-4052-2020","Cerveny, Daniel/0000-0003-1491-309X; Cerveny, Daniel/0000-0003-1491-309X; McCallum, Erin/0000-0001-5426-9652; Fick, Jerker/0000-0002-3949-7371; Brodin, Tomas/0000-0003-1086-7567",FORMAS grant [2013-734]; Wenner-Gren Foundation; Kempe Foundation,FORMAS grant(Swedish Research Council Formas); Wenner-Gren Foundation; Kempe Foundation,"We would like to thank R.

However, such frequent interactions also have the potential to mask or suppress behavioural differences if individuals conform towards a group behavioural norm (i.e. the social conformity hypothesis) by either synchronizing their behaviour or shifting their behaviour towards that of influential group members. Both of these predictions hinge on the notion that social feedback among group members plays a key role in modulating consistent behavioural variation; thus, in the absence of such feedback, it could be expected that such consistent variation will be reduced. Here, we investigated how a 1-month housing with a stable social group, as opposed to being socially isolated, affected consistent individual differences in the shoaling tendencies of threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aceluteus. Specifically, we repeatedly tested the tendency of individual sticklebacks to shoal with conspecifics before and after their social experience. In support of the social conformity hypothesis, we observed a four-fold increase in among-group differences, but no change in among-individual differences, in the shoaling tendencies of sticklebacks housed in groups. A post hoc analysis revealed that the increase in among-group differences may have been driven by the most ?social? pretreatment group member. Conversely, fish that were housed in isolation, expressed a notable, albeit nonsignificant, decrease in individual shoaling variation and repeatability. This decrease in shoaling variation corresponded with an increase in the average shoaling tendencies of solitary fish post-treatment, suggesting that solitary fish converged towards a similarly high level of shoaling tendencies post-treatment. For both treatment groups, however, we found amongindividual positive correlations in pre- and post-treatment shoaling tendencies, suggesting that individuals may inherently differ in their shoaling tendencies, but that the social environment plays an important role in mediating the expression of these differences. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Honeybees use their sense of smell to identify the queen and nestmates, to signal danger and to distinguish flowers during foraging. Few behavioural studies to date have examined how neonicotinoid pesticides affect the ability of bees to distinguish odours. Here, we used a differential learning task to test how neonicotinoid exposure affects learning, memory and olfactory perception in foraging-age honeybees. Bees fed with thiamethoxam could not perform differential learning and could not distinguish odours during short- and long-term memory tests. Our data indicate that thiamethoxam directly impacts the cognitive processes involved in working memory required during differential olfactory learning. Using a combination of behavioural assays, we also identified that thiamethoxam has a direct impact on the olfactory perception of similar odours. Honeybees fed with other neonicotinoids (clothianidin, imidacloprid, dinotefuran) performed the differential learning task, but at a slower rate than the control. These bees could also distinguish the odours. Our data are the first to show that neonicotinoids have compound specific effects on the ability of bees to perform a complex olfactory learning task. Deficits in decision making caused by thiamethoxam exposure could mean that this is more harmful than other neonicotinoids, leading to inefficient foraging and a reduced ability to identify nestmates.","[Mustard, Julie A.; Chavarria, Nancy L.] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Biol, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA; [Gott, Anne; Scott, Jennifer; Wright, Geraldine A.] Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Scott, Jennifer; Wright, Geraldine A.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3SZ, England",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; Newcastle University - UK; University of Oxford,"Wright, GA (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England.;Wright, GA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3SZ, England.",geraldine.wright@zoo.ox.ac.uk,,"Mustard, Julie A/0000-0002-1412-1140",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/S000402/1]; University of Oxford; BBSRC [BB/S000402/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); University of Oxford; BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),We thank the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council for funding (grant: BB/S000402/1).

Experiments exposing fishes and invertebrates to constant concentrations of microplastics often yield high variation in particle ingestion rates among individuals. Yet, despite an increasing interest in microplastic ingestion in the wild, the potential intrinsic drivers of inter-individual variation have received little attention so far. Here we assessed individual-level ingestion of Polyethylene microspheres by laboratory-reared juvenile anemonefish, Amphiprion ocellaris, in relation to (a) ambient particle concentrations and (b) repeatable behavioural traits. We show that microplastic ingestion is highly variable at all tested particle concentrations and that this variation can partially be explained by individual activity levels. Moreover, the relationship between ingestion and behavioural variation increased notably when only the most behaviourally consistent individuals (n = 40 out of 60) were considered in the analysis. Our findings indicate that microplastic ingestion rates in juvenile reef fishes may be less dependent on ambient concentrations than expected; instead they are to some degree phenotype-dependent. Care should thus be taken when reporting mean responses to microplastic exposure treatments, because some individuals may not be affected in the same way as others due to differential ingestion behaviour. We also discuss potential ramifications of non-random ingestion variability on population- and community-level responses. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Honeybees are exposed to two widely used classes of cholinergic pesticide: neonicotinoids (nicotinic receptor agonists) and organophosphate miticides (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors). Although sublethal levels of neonicotinoids are known to disrupt honeybee learning and behaviour, the neurophysiological basis of these effects has not been shown. Here, using recordings from mushroom body Kenyon cells in acutely isolated honeybee brain, we show that the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and clothianidin, and the organophosphate miticide coumaphos oxon, cause a depolarization-block of neuronal firing and inhibit nicotinic responses. These effects are observed at concentrations that are encountered by foraging honeybees and within the hive, and are additive with combined application. Our findings demonstrate a neuronal mechanism that may account for the cognitive impairments caused by neonicotinoids, and predict that exposure to multiple pesticides that target cholinergic signalling will cause enhanced toxicity to pollinators.","[Palmer, Mary J.; Moffat, Christopher; Saranzewa, Nastja; Harvey, Jenni; Connolly, Christopher N.] Univ Dundee, Ninewells Med Sch, Med Res Inst, Div Neurosci, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland; [Wright, Geraldine A.] Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Ctr Behav & Evolut, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",University of Dundee; Newcastle University - UK,"Connolly, CN (corresponding author), Univ Dundee, Ninewells Med Sch, Med Res Inst, Div Neurosci, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland.",c.n.connolly@dundee.ac.uk,"Serrano, Jose/A-2854-2009","Serrano, Jose/0000-0002-1565-5216; Harvey, Jenni/0000-0002-9858-001X; Palmer, Mary/0000-0002-5539-6052; Connolly, Christopher/0000-0002-0445-8874","BBSRC under the Insect Pollinators Initiative (UK) [BB/1000313/1, BB/1000143/1]; DEFRA under the Insect Pollinators Initiative (UK) [BB/1000313/1, BB/1000143/1]; NERC under the Insect Pollinators Initiative (UK) [BB/1000313/1, BB/1000143/1]; Scottish Government under the Insect Pollinators Initiative (UK) [BB/1000313/1, BB/1000143/1]; Wellcome Trust under the Insect Pollinators Initiative (UK) [BB/1000313/1, BB/1000143/1]; BBSRC [BB/I000313/1, BB/I000143/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I000143/1, BB/I000313/1, C18896] Funding Source: researchfish",BBSRC under the Insect Pollinators Initiative (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); DEFRA under the Insect Pollinators Initiative (UK); NERC under the Insect Pollinators Initiative (UK); Scottish Government under the Insect Pollinators Initiative (UK); Wellcome Trust under the Insect Pollinators Initiative (UK); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),"This work has been funded jointly by BBSRC, DEFRA, NERC, the Scottish Government and the Wellcome Trust, under the Insect Pollinators Initiative (UK) grant BB/1000313/1 (CNC) and BB/1000143/1 (G.

Well-quantified laboratory studies can provide a fundamental understanding of animal behavior in ecology, ethology and ecotoxicology research. These types of studies require observation and tracking of each animal in well-controlled and defined arenas, often for long timescales. Thus, these experiments produce long time series and a vast amount of data that require the use of software applications to automate the analysis and reduce manual annotation. In this review, we examine 28 free software applications for animal tracking to guide researchers in selecting the software that might best suit a particular experiment. We also review the algorithms in the tracking pipeline of the applications, explain how specific techniques can fit different experiments, and finally, expose each approach's weaknesses and strengths. Our in-depth review includes last update, type of platform, user-friendliness, off- or online video acquisition, calibration method, background subtraction and segmentation method, species, multiple arenas, multiple animals, identity preservation, manual identity correction, data analysis and extra features. We found, for example, that out of 28 programs, only 3 include a calibration algorithm to reduce image distortion and perspective problems that affect accuracy and can result in substantial errors when analyzing trajectories and extracting mobility or explored distance. In addition, only 4 programs can directly export in-depth tracking and analysis metrics, only 5 are suited for tracking multiple unmarked animals for more than a few seconds and only 11 have been updated in the period 2019-2021.","[Panadeiro, Veronica; Rodriguez, Alvaro] Univ A Coruna, Dept Comp Sci, Campus Elvina, La Coruna, Spain; [Rodriguez, Alvaro] Univ A Coruna, Ctr Res Informat & Commun Technol CITIC, Campus Elvina, La Coruna, Spain; [Rodriguez, Alvaro] UNED, Dept Basic Psychol 1, Ciudad Univ, Madrid, Spain; [Henry, Jason; Wlodkowic, Donald] RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Neurotox Lab, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Andersson, Magnus] Umea Univ, Dept Phys, Umea, Sweden",Universidade da Coruna; Universidade da Coruna; Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Umea University,"Rodriguez, A (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, Dept Comp Sci, Campus Elvina, La Coruna, Spain.;Rodriguez, A (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, Ctr Res Informat & Commun Technol CITIC, Campus Elvina, La Coruna, Spain.;Rodriguez, A (corresponding author), UNED, Dept Basic Psychol 1, Ciudad Univ, Madrid, Spain.",a.tajes@udc.es,"Andersson, Magnus/A-3591-2009; Rodriguez, Alvaro/M-9208-2014","Andersson, Magnus/0000-0002-9835-3263; Rodriguez, Alvaro/0000-0002-2690-090X; Wlodkowic, Donald/0000-0002-0780-3362; Panadeiro Castro, Veronica/0000-0002-8085-537X; Henry, Jason/0000-0002-0059-3868",,,,,79,39,42,9,60,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",0093-7355,1548-4475,,LAB ANIMAL,Lab Anim.,2021 SEP,2021,50,9,,,,,246,254,,10.1038/s41684-021-00811-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41684-021-00811-1,,JUL 2021,9,Veterinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Veterinary Sciences,UE6NP,34326537,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000679222800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Gulf of Mexico is a critical bird migration route area and migrants that were oiled but did not suffer mortality as a direct result of the spill faced unpredictable fates. This study utilized homing pigeons as a surrogate species for migratory birds to investigate the effects a single low level external oiling event has on the flight performance and behavior of birds flying repeated 161 km flights. Data from GPS data loggers showed that lightly oiled pigeons changed their flight paths, increased their flight durations by 2.6 fold, increased their flight distances by 28 km and subsequently decreased their route efficiencies. Oiled birds also exhibited reduced rate of weight gain between flights. Our data suggest that contaminated birds surviving the oil spill may have experienced flight impairment and reduced refueling abilities, likely reducing overall migration speed. Our findings contribute new information on how oil spills affect avian species, as the effects of oil on the flight behavior of long distance free-flying birds have not been previously described.

Local interactions among individuals determine their behaviour and regulate the activity of the colony. Harvester ants are recruited for outside work, using networks of brief antennal contacts, in the nest chamber closest to the nest exit: the entrance chamber. Here, we combine empirical observations, image analysis and computer simulations to investigate the structure and function of the interaction network in the entrance chamber. Ant interactions were distributed heterogeneously in the chamber, with an interaction hot-spot at the entrance leading further into the nest. The distribution of the total interactions per ant followed a right-skewed distribution, indicating the presence of highly connected individuals. Numbers of ant encounters observed positively correlated with the duration of observation. Individuals varied in interaction frequency, even after accounting for the duration of observation. An ant's interaction frequency was explained by its path shape and location within the entrance chamber. Computer simulations demonstrate that variation among individuals in connectivity accelerates information flow to an extent equivalent to an increase in the total number of interactions. Individual variation in connectivity, arising from variation among ants in location and spatial behaviour, creates interaction centres, which may expedite information flow.","[Pinter-Wollman, Noa; Gordon, Deborah M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pinter-Wollman, Noa; Guetz, Adam; Holmes, Susan] Stanford Univ, Dept Stat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wollman, Roy] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University,"Pinter-Wollman, N (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nmpinter@stanford.edu,"Holmes, Susan P./JGL-6344-2023","Holmes, Susan P./0000-0002-2208-8168",NSF; NIH [5-R01GM086884]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Emerging Frontiers [1038708] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Direct For Biological Sciences; Emerging Frontiers(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),We would like to thank E.

A key question is whether the consequences of these pollutants extend beyond mean behavioural changes, restraining differences in behaviour between individuals. In a controlled, two-year, multigenerational experiment with independent mesocosm populations, we exposed guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to environmentally realistic levels of the ubiquitous pollutant fluoxetine (Prozac). Fish (unexposed: n = 59, low fluoxetine: n = 57, high fluoxetine: n = 58) were repeatedly assayed on four separate occasions for activity and risk-taking behaviour. Fluoxetine homogenized individuals' activity, with individual variation in populations exposed to even low concentrations falling to less than half that in unexposed populations. To understand the proximate mechanism underlying these changes, we tested the relative contribution of variation within and between individuals to the overall decline in individual variation. We found strong evidence that fluoxetine erodes variation in activity between but not within individuals, revealing the hidden consequences of a ubiquitous contaminant on phenotypic variation in fish-likely to impair adaptive potential to environmental change.","[Poiverino, Giovanni; Soman, Vrishin R.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Sch Biol Sci, M092,35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Martin, Jake M.; Bertram, Michael G.; Tan, Hung; Brand, Jack A.; Mason, Rachel T.; Wong, Bob B.

BP3 is currently receiving a great deal of attention because many of its properties, including high water solubility and potential to bioaccumulate, enable it to have damaging effects on aquatic ecosystems. One of these effects, the induction of coral bleaching, has led Hawaii to ban all sunscreens containing BP3. BP3 also appears to have endocrine-disrupting properties and has been found to affect animal physiology. However, behavioural consequences of BP3 exposure have yet to be thoroughly characterized. In the present study, we investigated the effects of BP3 on boldness, courtship and aggression in male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, as little is known about the effects that BP3 has on fish social behaviour. To accomplish this, we assigned males to a treatment group (control, low, medium or high BP3 concentration) and completed individual (empty tank, novel environment and shoal) and social (courtship and aggression) behavioural assays before and after a 28-day exposure period. BP3 influenced the expression of social behaviours, with individual boldness generally unaffected. Changes in shoaling occurred regardless of BP3 concentration, while BP3-associated decreases in courtship and aggression were concentration dependent. Abnormal social behaviour may impede successful mating and alter territorial dynamics, with potentially heightened effects in species already experiencing other anthropogenic stressors.

Direct contact of olfactory neuroepithelium to the surrounding environment makes it vulnerable to contaminants in aquatic ecosystems. Copper nanoparticles (CuNPs), which are increasingly used in commercial and domestic applications due their exceptional properties, can impair fish olfactory function. However, the molecular events underlying olfactory toxicity of CuNPs are largely unexplored. Our results suggested that CuNPs were bioavailable to olfactory mucosal cells. Using RNA-seq, we compared the effect of CuNPs and copper ions (Cu2+) on gene transcript profiles of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) olfactory mucosa. The narrow overlap in differential gene expression between the CuNP- and Cu2+-exposed fish revealed that these two contaminants exert their effects through distinct mechanisms. We propose a transcript-based conceptual model that shows that olfactory signal transduction, calcium homeostasis, and synaptic vesicular signaling were affected by CuNPs in the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Neuroregenerative pathways were also impaired by CuNPs. In contrast, Cu2+ did not induce toxicity pathways and rather upregulated regeneration pathways. Both Cu treatments reduced immune system pathway transcripts. However, suppression of transcripts that were associated with inflammatory signaling was only observed with CuNPs. Neither oxidative stress nor apoptosis were triggered by Cu2+ or CuNPs in mucosal cells. Dysregulation of transcripts that regulate function, maintenance, and reestablishment of damaged olfactory mucosa represents critical mechanisms of toxicity of CuNPs. The loss of olfaction by CuNPs may impact survival of rainbow trout and impose an ecological risk to fish populations in contaminated environments. Crown Copyright (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although pesticide application serves many important purposes, including protection against crop loss and against vector-borne diseases, there are significant concerns over the potential toxic effects of pesticides to non-target organisms, including humans. In many cases, the molecular target of a pesticide is shared by non-target species, leading to the potential for untoward effects. Here, we review the history of pesticide usage and the neurotoxicity of selected classes of pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, to humans and experimental animals. Specific emphasis is given to linkages between exposure to pesticides and risk of neurological disease and dysfunction in humans coupled with mechanistic findings in humans and animal models. Finally, we discuss emerging techniques and strategies to improve translation from animal models to humans.","[Richardson, Jason R.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Robert Stempel Sch Publ Hlth & Social Work, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Fitsanakis, Vanessa] Northeast Ohio Med Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Rootstown, OH USA; [Westerink, Remco H.

Several publications have reviewed such actions of EDCs in subgroups of species, e.g., fish or rodents. In this review, we take a holistic approach synthesizing knowledge of the effects of EDCs across vertebrate species, including fish, anurans, birds, and mammals, and discuss the potential mechanism(s) mediating such multi- and transgenerational effects.

Indeed, recent work explicitly performed under environmentally realistic conditions reveals that chemical contaminants can have both direct and indirect effects at multiple levels of organization by influencing animal behaviour. Altered behaviour reflects multiple physiological changes and links individual-to population-level processes, thereby representing a sensitive tool for holistically assessing impacts of environmentally relevant contaminant concentrations. Here, we show that even if direct effects of contaminants on behavioural responses are reasonably well documented, there are significant knowledge gaps in understanding both the plasticity (i.e. individual variation) and evolution of contaminant-induced behavioural changes. We explore implications of multi-level processes by developing a conceptual framework that integrates direct and indirect effects on behaviour under environmentally realistic contexts. Our framework illustrates how sublethal behavioural effects of contaminants can be both negative and positive, varying dynamically within the same individuals and populations. This is because linkages within communities will act indirectly to alter and even magnify contaminant-induced effects. Given the increasing pressure on wildlife and ecosystems from chemical pollution, we argue there is a need to incorporate existing knowledge in ecology and evolution to improve ecological hazard and risk assessments.","[Saaristo, Minna; Bertram, Michael G.; Wong, Bob B.

Yet, without overcoming fundamental challenges such as how to coordinate movements with conspecifics, animals cannot maintain cohesion, and coordination is thus a prerequisite for the evolution of sociality in nonstationary animals. Although it has been considered that animal groups must coordinate the timing and direction of movements, coordinating speed is also essential to prevent the group from splitting. We investigated speed consensus in homing pigeon, Columba livia, flocks using high-resolution GPS. Despite observable differences in average solo speed (which was positively correlated with bird mass) compromises of up to 6% from the preferred solo speed were made to reach consensus in flocks. These results match theory which suggests that groups fly at an intermediate of solo speeds, which suggests speed averaging. By virtue of minimizing extreme compromises, speed averaging can maximize selective benefits across the group, suggesting shared consensus for group speed could be ubiquitous across taxa. Nevertheless, despite group-wide advantages, contemporary flight models have suggested unequal energetic costs in favour of individuals with intermediate body mass/preferred speed (hence the 'Goldilocks principle').

Individuals in selfish herds are thought to benefit by reducing their own risk at the expense of conspecifics by attracting toward their neighbors' positions(1,2) or central locations in the aggregation.(3-5) Alternatively, increased alignment with their neighbors' orientation could reduce the chance of predation through information sharing(6-8) or collective escape.(6) Using both small and large flocks of homing pigeons (Columba livia; n = 8-10 or n = 27-34 individuals) tagged with 5-Hz GPS loggers and a GPS-tagged, remote-controlled model peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), we tested whether individuals increase their use of attraction over alignment when under perceived threat. We conducted n = 27 flights in treatment conditions, chased by the robotic predator,'' and n = 16 flights in control conditions (not chased). Despite responding strongly to the RobotFalcon-by turning away from its flight direction-individuals in treatment flocks demonstrated no increased attraction compared with control flocks, and this result held across both flock sizes. We suggest that mutualistic alignment is more advantageous than selfish attraction in groups with a high coincidence of individual and collective interests (adaptive hypothesis). However, we also explore alternative explanations, such as high cognitive demand under threat and collision avoidance (mechanistic hypotheses).

This compound has been reported in continental waters reaching concentrations of mu g/L as a consequence of its inefficient removal in sewage treatment plants and increasing use over time. In this study, European chubs (Squalius cephalus) were exposed to 1 mu g/L of tramadol in water for 42 days with a subsequent 14 days of depuration. Our results revealed that chubs exposed to this analgesic underwent changes in their behaviour as compared to the control group. The behavioural outcome was also influenced by the individual concentration of tramadol in brain tissue. In particular, experimental fish presented anxiolytic-like effects, characterized by less bold and less social individuals. Exposed animals were less frequently out of the shelter and moved a shorter distance, indicating that they explored the new environment less during the boldness test. In the novel object recognition experiment, although they distinguished the new item, they examined it less and displayed a reduced activity. Shoal cohesion was disrupted as observed in an increased distance between individuals. After the depuration phase, this alteration remained whereas the boldness effect disappeared. Moreover, the degree of behavioural changes was correlated with the concentration of the substance in brain. According to our findings, chronic presence of tramadol in the environment can impact the fitness of exposed aquatic fauna by altering evolutionary crucial behaviours.","[Santos, Maria Eugenia Sancho; Grabicova, Katerina; Grabic, Roman; Randak, Tomas] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Fisheries & Protect Waters, South Bohemian Res Ctr Aquaculture & Biodivers Hy, Zatisi 728-2, Vodnany 38925, Czech Republic; [Horky, Pavel; Hubena, Pavla; Slavik, Ondrej; Douda, Karel] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Zool & Fisheries, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Santos, MES (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Fisheries & Protect Waters, South Bohemian Res Ctr Aquaculture & Biodivers Hy, Zatisi 728-2, Vodnany 38925, Czech Republic.",esanchosantos@frov.jcu.cz,"Slav°k, Ondrej/A-4732-2013; HorkÏ, Pavel/A-3857-2013; Sancho Santos, Maria Eugenia/HZK-8495-2023; Douda, Karel/D-4759-2011; Grabic, Roman/AAF-5412-2021; Sancho Santos, Maria Eugenia/JFS-0499-2023; Randak, Tomas/G-1798-2015; Grabicova, Katerina/F-7921-2015","HorkÏ, Pavel/0000-0002-1738-7753; Sancho Santos, Maria Eugenia/0000-0002-0492-4783; Douda, Karel/0000-0002-7778-5147; Grabic, Roman/0000-0002-0935-2075; Sancho Santos, Maria Eugenia/0000-0002-0492-4783; Hubena, Pavla/0000-0001-6351-6395; Randak, Tomas/0000-0003-0462-266X; Grabicova, Katerina/0000-0002-6026-6260","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [LM2018099]; Czech Science Foundation [20-09951S]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic); Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic)","This study was financially supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic - projects CENAKVA (LM2018099), and by the Czech Science Foundation (No. 20-09951S).

The role that animal 'personalities' play in this question has recently become a focus of research interest. Although many animal groups have distributed leadership (i.e. multiple individuals influence collective decisions), studies linking personality and leadership have focused predominantly on the group's single most influential individual. In this study, we investigate the relationship between personality and the influence of multiple leaders on collective movement using homing pigeons, Columba livia, a species known to display complex multilevel leadership hierarchies during flock flights. Our results show that more exploratory (i.e. 'bold') birds are more likely to occupy higher ranks in the leadership hierarchy and thus have more influence on the direction of collective movement than less exploratory (i.e. 'shy') birds during both free flights around their lofts and homing flights from a distant site. Our data also show that bold pigeons fly faster than shy birds during solo flights. We discuss our results in light of theories about the evolution of personality, with specific reference to the adaptive value of heterogeneity in animal groups.","[Sasaki, Takao; Warren, Katherine N.; Herbert, Tristian; Biro, Dora] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Mann, Richard P.] Univ Leeds, Sch Math, Dept Stat, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Wilson, Tara] UCL, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of Oxford; University of Leeds; University of London; University College London,"Sasaki, T (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",takao.sasaki@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"; Mann, Richard/N-9779-2014","Wilson, Tara/0009-0001-8479-6346; Sasaki, Takao/0000-0002-4409-7655; Biro, Dora/0000-0002-3408-6274; Mann, Richard/0000-0003-0701-1274",Royal Society Newton Fellowship; Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship; Royal Society University Research Fellowship,Royal Society Newton Fellowship(Royal Society); Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship; Royal Society University Research Fellowship(Royal Society),T.S. was supported by a Royal Society Newton Fellowship and a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship.

Although direct toxicity may be partly responsible, contaminants are often present at sub-lethal concentrations in the wild. Behavioural end-points are becoming an increasingly useful method to estimate the impact of contaminants, particularly if the behavioural responses manifest to affect individual fitness (i.e. survival, growth, or reproduction). In the wild, most animals are affected by multiple stressors, and determining how these interact to affect behaviour is critical for understanding the ecological implications of contaminant exposure. Here, we examined the individual and interactive effect of the heavy metal copper and the insecticide imidacloprid on mortality rates and anti-predator behaviours of spotted marsh frog (Limnodynastes tasmaniensis) tadpoles. This common species frequently occupies and breeds in contaminated stormwater and agricultural wetlands, where copper and imidacloprid are often present. These contaminants may alter behaviour via physiological and neurological pathways, as well as affecting how tadpoles respond to chemical cues. Tadpoles suffered unexpectedly high mortality rates when exposed to imidacloprid concentrations well below published LC50 concentrations. Only unexposed tadpoles significantly avoided predator cues. Copper and imidacloprid reduced swimming speed and distance, and escape responses, while increasing erratic swimming. We observed an interactive effect of imidacloprid and copper on erratic swimming, but in general imidacloprid and copper did not act synergistically. Our results suggest that as contaminants enter waterbodies, tadpoles will suffer considerable direct mortality, reduced foraging capacity, and increased susceptibility to predation. Our results provide the first evidence of imidacloprid affecting amphibian behaviour, and highlight both the adverse effects of copper and imidacloprid, and the importance of exploring the effect of multiple contaminants simultaneously.","[Sievers, Michael; Hale, Robin; Swearer, Stephen E.] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Sievers, Michael; Parris, Kirsten M.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Sievers, M (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",sieversm@unimelb.edu.au,"Parris, Kirsten/K-7684-2012; Swearer, Stephen/X-4882-2018; SWEARER, STEPHEN/AAC-1527-2020; Sievers, Michael/ABA-5513-2020","Parris, Kirsten/0000-0003-2550-585X; Swearer, Stephen/0000-0001-6381-9943; SWEARER, STEPHEN/0000-0001-6381-9943; Sievers, Michael/0000-0001-7162-1830",Australian Research Council [LP140100343]; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Melbourne Water; Nature Conservancy; Clean Air and Urban Landscapes Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program; Australian Research Council [LP140100343] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Melbourne Water; Nature Conservancy; Clean Air and Urban Landscapes Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank T.

Most insecticides are insect neurotoxins. Evidence is emerging that sublethal doses of these neurotoxins are affecting the learning and memory of both wild and managed bee colonies, exacerbating the negative effects of pesticide exposure and reducing individual foraging efficiency. 2. Variation in methodologies and interpretation of results across studies has precluded the quantitative evaluation of these impacts that is needed to make recommendations for policy change. It is not clear whether robust effects occur under acute exposure regimes (often argued to be more field-realistic than the chronic regimes upon which many studies are based), for field-realistic dosages, and for pesticides other than neonicotinoids. 3. Here we use meta-analysis to examine the impact of pesticides on bee performance in proboscis extension-based learning assays, the paradigm most commonly used to assess learning and memory in bees. We draw together 104 (learning) and 167 (memory) estimated effect sizes across a diverse range of studies. 4. We detected significant negative effects of pesticides on learning and memory (i) at field realistic dosages, (ii) under both chronic and acute application, and (iii) for both neonicotinoid and non-neonicotinoid pesticides groups. 5. We also expose key gaps in the literature that include a critical lack of studies on non-Apis bees, on larval exposure (potentially one of the major exposure routes), and on performance in alternative learning paradigms. 6. Policy implications. Procedures for the registration of new pesticides within EU member states now typically require assessment of risks to pollinators if potential target crops are attractive to bees. However, our results provide robust quantitative evidence for subtle, sublethal effects, the consequences of which are unlikely to be detected within small-scale prelicensing laboratory or field trials, but can be critical when pesticides are used at a landscape scale. Our findings highlight the need for long-term postlicensing environmental safety monitoring as a requirement within licensing policy for plant protection products.","[Siviter, Harry; Koricheva, Julia; Brown, Mark J.

These recent technological advances are improving the scale and resolution with which we can dissect interactions among animals. They are also revealing new intricacies of animal social interactions at spatial and temporal resolutions as well as in ecological contexts that have been hidden from humans, making the unwatchable seeable. We first outline how these technological applications are permitting researchers to collect exquisitely detailed information with little observer bias. We further recognize new emerging challenges from these new reality-mining approaches.

Whether such correlations are caused by underlying individual differences in social attraction usually remains unclear, because to identify effects of individual traits on social attraction, it is essential to experimentally exclude the influence of the social partner. Using standardized high-definition video playback on captive great tits (Parus major), we effectively demonstrate the influence of individual traits on the motivation to be near a conspecific. We show that social attraction varied contrastingly with boldness and stimulus novelty. Shyer birds tended to show stronger social attraction when they were confronted with the stimulus bird for the first time. Lower ranked birds showed the overall strongest social attraction. This rank effect remained after experimentally changing dominance ranks by altering group compositions. Moreover, preference for social association tended to increase with a decrease in dominance rank, suggesting that birds plastically change their social preference in relation to their within-group dominance status. Our results provide insight into how social relations can form and change, processes that are key for understanding the long-term consequences of the social environment, and the role individuals might play in influencing this environment themselves.","[Snijders, Lysanne; Naguib, Marc] Wageningen Univ & Res, Behav Ecol Grp, Dept Anim Sci, POB 338, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands; [Snijders, Lysanne; van Oers, Kees] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, Droevendaalsesteeg 10, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW),"Snijders, L (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Behav Ecol Grp, Dept Anim Sci, POB 338, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands.;Snijders, L (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, Droevendaalsesteeg 10, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",lysanne.snijders@wur.nl,"Snijders, Lysanne/I-1384-2019; van Oers, Kees/B-2562-2009; Naguib, Marc/C-2650-2009; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Snijders, Lysanne/0000-0003-0911-3418; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; van Oers, Kees/0000-0001-6984-906X; Naguib, Marc/0000-0003-0494-4888",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) ALW open competition grant [821.01.01],Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) ALW open competition grant,This project was funded via a Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) ALW open competition grant 821.01.01 awarded to M.N.,,69,20,21,5,56,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

In this study the effects of copper NPs (Cu NPs) on the anti-predator behavioural responses of juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to trout alarm substance was investigated. Individual fish were exposed for 12 h to a control (no added Cu), 50 mu g l(-1) of Cu as Cu NPs, or 50 mu g l(-1) Cu as CuSO4, after which fish behaviours were analyzed in 10 min periods before and after the addition of the alarm substance stimillus. The response of control fish to deionised water (negative control, no alarm substance stimulus) was also analyzed. The alarm substance elicited a behavioural response in the control fish characterized by an immediate freeze response and the slower resumption of swimming activity compared to negative controls exposed to the sham deionised water stimuli. In fish exposed to Cu NPs, the behavioural response to alarm substance was eliminated, with no significant difference in behaviours compared to negative controls. In comparison, exposure to 50 mu g l(-1) Cu as CuSO4 decreased, but did not eliminate the response of fish to alarm substance, which indicated a significantly greater effect of Cu NPs on olfactory mediated behaviours than of the equivalent concentration of Cu as CuSO4. Measurement of total Cu concentrations in the tissues of fish demonstrated no significant accumulation of Cu from any treatment in gill, liver or brain, confirming the effects of Cu NPs, and to a lesser extent CuSO4, on behavioural responses were mostly associated with the interaction of the materials with the external surfaces of the fish. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that Cu as CuSO4 caused a pronounced depletion of ciliated sensory and non-sensory cells in the olfactory rosette surrounding the midline raphe, whereas Cu NPs had no impact on the structure of the rosette. However, exposure to Cu NPs caused a significant increase in the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione in brains of fish, indicating some systemic oxidative stress that was not observed in either controls or fish exposed to CuSO4. Overall, the study showed that the olfactory mediated behaviours of fish were potentially more sensitive to Cu NPs than CuSO4 and NPs elicited effects via a mechanism that is distinct from that of the metal salt.

However, effects of neonicotinoids on male (drone) honeybee health remain severely understudied. We examined for the first time the multidimensional effects of field-realistic concentrations of two common neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) on drone honeybee survival, behaviour and physiology using individuals reared and maintained as adults in the field. Our data showed that neonicotinoids reduced honeybee drone survival by 51%, increased drifting behaviour to non-maternal colonies by 100%, delayed flight activities by 3 days and reduced number of living sperm by 28%. However, they did not influence the sperm concentration produced by the drones, the strength of the drone's maternal colonies or the total number of drones produced by those colonies. Policy implications. Our study demonstrated that neonicotinoids can elicit a diverse array of lethal (survival) and sublethal (behaviour, reproductive physiology) effects on male honeybees Apis mellifera in the field. These findings should be considered by policy makers looking to adopt and implement science-based, holistic risk assessments to more comprehensively assess effects of chemicals on important ecosystem service providing insects like the honeybee. To date, risk assessment schemes do not specifically address potential effects on male bees.","[Straub, Lars; Villamar-Bouza, Laura; Bruckner, Selina; Kolari, Eleonora; Neumann, Peter; Williams, Geoffrey R.] Univ Bern, Vetsuisse Fac, Inst Bee Hlth, Bern, Switzerland; [Straub, Lars; Neumann, Peter; Williams, Geoffrey R.] Swiss Bee Res Ctr, Agroscope, Bern, Switzerland; [Bruckner, Selina] Auburn Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Chantawannakul, Panuwan; Maitip, Jakkrawut; Williams, Geoffrey R.] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Bee Protect Lab, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Chantawannakul, Panuwan] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Sci, Environm Sci Res Ctr, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Maitip, Jakkrawut] King Mongkuts Univ Technol North Bangkok, Fac Sci Energy & Environm, Rayong, Thailand; [Vidondo, Beatriz] Univ Bern, Vetsuisse Fac, Vet Publ Hlth Inst, Bern, Switzerland; [Villamar-Bouza, Laura] European Food Safety Author EFSA, Pesticides Unit, Parma, Italy",University of Bern; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Auburn University System; Auburn University; Chiang Mai University; Chiang Mai University; King Mongkuts University of Technology North Bangkok; University of Bern; European Food Safety Authority,"Straub, L; Williams, GR (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Vetsuisse Fac, Inst Bee Hlth, Bern, Switzerland.;Straub, L; Williams, GR (corresponding author), Swiss Bee Res Ctr, Agroscope, Bern, Switzerland.;Williams, GR (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Bee Protect Lab, Chiang Mai, Thailand.",lars.straub@vetsuisse.unibe.ch; williams@auburn.edu,"Williams, Geoffrey R/C-9637-2015; Maitip, Jakkrawut/AAF-7539-2019; Straub, Lars/AAP-2820-2020; Bruckner, Selina/IQW-7496-2023","Straub, Lars/0000-0002-2091-1499; Bruckner, Selina/0000-0001-6722-076X; Maitip, Jakkrawut/0000-0001-6265-1421",Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research [549003]; Bundesamt fur Umwelt [16.0091.PJ/R102-1664]; USDA Cooperative Agreement [6066-21000-001-02-S]; Swiss National Fund [31003A_169751]; USDA Hatch Project [NC1173]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [31003A_169751] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research; Bundesamt fur Umwelt; USDA Cooperative Agreement(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Swiss National Fund(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); USDA Hatch Project; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, Grant/Award Number: 549003; Bundesamt fur Umwelt, Grant/Award Number: 16.0091.PJ/R102-1664; USDA Cooperative Agreement, Grant/Award Number: 6066-21000-001-02-S; Swiss National Fund, Grant/Award Number: 31003A_169751; USDA Hatch Project, Grant/Award Number: NC1173",,157,11,11,6,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Increasingly, pharmaceutical pollutants are documented to disrupt ecologically important physiological and behavioural traits in exposed wildlife. However, little is known about potential impacts of pharmaceutical exposure on among-individual variation in these traits, despite phenotypic diversity being critical for population resilience to environmental change. Furthermore, although wildlife commonly experience multiple stressors contemporaneously, potential interactive effects between pharmaceuticals and biological stressorsdsuch as predation threatdremain poorly understood. To redress this, we investigated the impacts of long-term exposure to the pervasive pharmaceutical pollutant fluoxetine (Prozac (R)) on among-individual variation in metabolic and behavioural traits, and the combined impacts of fluoxetine exposure and predation threat on mean metabolic and behavioural traits in a freshwater fish, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Using a mesocosm system, guppy populations were exposed for 15 months to one of two field-realistic levels of fluoxetine (nominal concentrations: 30 and 300 ng/L) or a solvent control. Fish from these populations were then tested for metabolic rate (oxygen uptake) and behaviour (activity), both before and after experiencing one of three levels of a predation treatment: an empty tank, a non-predatory fish (Melanotaenia splendida) or a predatory fish (Leiopotherapon unicolor). Guppies from both fluoxetine treatments had similar to 70% lower among-individual variation in their activity levels, compared to unexposed fish. Similarly, fluoxetine exposure at the higher dosage was associated with a significant (26%) reduction in individual-level variation in oxygen uptake relative to unexposed fish. In addition, mean baseline metabolic rate was disrupted in low-fluoxetine exposed fish, although mean metabolic and behavioural responses to predation threat were not affected. Overall, our study demonstrates that long-term exposure to a pervasive pharmaceutical pollutant alters ecologically relevant traits in fish and erodes among-individual variability, which may be detrimental to the stability of contaminated populations globally.

Here we use a global database of pesticide applications and a spatially explicit environmental model to estimate the world geography of environmental pollution risk caused by 92 active ingredients in 168 countries. We considered a region to be at risk of pollution if pesticide residues in the environment exceeded the no-effect concentrations, and to be at high risk if residues exceeded this by three orders of magnitude. We find that 64% of global agricultural land (approximately 24.5 million km(2)) is at risk of pesticide pollution by more than one active ingredient, and 31% is at high risk. Among the high-risk areas, about 34% are in high-biodiversity regions, 5% in water-scarce areas and 19% in low- and lower-middle-income nations. We identify watersheds in South Africa, China, India, Australia and Argentina as high-concern regions because they have high pesticide pollution risk, bear high biodiversity and suffer from water scarcity. Our study expands earlier pesticide risk assessments as it accounts for multiple active ingredients and integrates risks in different environmental compartments at a global scale.","[Tang, Fiona H.

Little is known about the effect of neonicotinoids on other beneficial insects such as parasitoid wasps, which serve as natural enemies and are crucial for ecosystem functioning. Here we show that sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid impair sexual communication and host finding in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Depending on the dose, treated females were less responsive to the male sex pheromone or unable to use it as a cue at all. Courtship behaviour of treated couples was also impeded resulting in a reduction of mating rates by up to 80%. Moreover, treated females were no longer able to locate hosts by using olfactory cues. Olfaction is crucial for the reproductive success of parasitoid wasps. Hence, sublethal doses of neonicotinoids might compromise the function of parasitoid wasps as natural enemies with potentially dire consequences for ecosystem services.","[Tappert, Lars; Pokorny, Tamara; Ruther, Joachim] Univ Regensburg, Inst Zool, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Hofferberth, John] Kenyon Coll, Dept Chem, Gambier, OH 43022 USA",University of Regensburg; University System of Ohio; Kenyon College,"Ruther, J (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Inst Zool, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",joachim.ruther@ur.de,"Ruther, Joachim/AAE-3568-2019","Ruther, Joachim/0000-0002-1295-347X",,,,,64,49,56,2,66,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,FEB 15,2017,7,,,,,,,,42756,10.1038/srep42756,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep42756,,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,EL0FZ,28198464,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-03,WOS:000394299600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although fish are increasingly exposed to pharmaceutical compounds that may alter expression of such behavior, potential effects are understudied. Here, we examine the impact of lifelong exposure to two concentrations (0.7 and 5.3 mu g/L) of the antidepressant fluoxetine on fecundity and social behavior (i.e. sociability and male-male aggression) in the turquoise killifish, Nothobranchius furzeri. When exposed to the highest concentration of fluoxetine (5.3 mu g/L), fish were smaller at maturation but they more frequently engaged in mating. In addition, in both fluoxetine treatments females roughly doubled their overall fecundity while egg fertilization rates were the same for exposed and unexposed fish. Although aggression of male fish was not impacted by fluoxetine exposure, exposed male fish (5.3 mu g/L) spent more time in the proximity of a group of conspecifics, which implies an increased sociability in these individuals. Overall, the results of this study indicate that exposure to fluoxetine may result in disrupted male sociability, increased mating frequency and an increased reproductive output in fish populations.

In recent years, concern has been mounting over a group of endocrine disruptors known as hormonal growth promotants (HGPs), which are natural and synthetic chemicals used to promote growth in livestock by targeting the endocrine system. One of the most potent compounds to enter the environment as a result of HGP use is 17 beta-trenbolone, which has repeatedly been detected in aquatic habitats. Although recent research has revealed that 17 beta-trenbolone can interfere with mechanisms of sexual selection, its potential to impact sequential female mate choice remains unknown, as is true for all EDCs. To address this, we exposed female guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to 17 beta-trenbolone at an environmentally relevant level (average measured concentration: 2 ng/L) for 21 days using a flow-through system. We then compared the response of unexposed and exposed females to sequentially presented stimulus (i.e., unexposed) males that varied in their relative body area of orange pigmentation, as female guppies have a known preference for orange colouration in males. We found that, regardless of male orange pigmentation, both unexposed and exposed females associated with males indiscriminately during their first male encounter. However, during the second male presentation, unexposed females significantly reduced the amount of time they spent associating with low-orange males if they had previously encountered a high orange male. Conversely, 17 beta-trenbolone-exposed females associated with males indiscriminately (i.e., regardless of orange colouration) during both their first and second male encounter, and, overall, associated with males significantly less than did unexposed females during both presentations.

The effects of agricultural pesticides on honeybee health have therefore raised concern. Bees can be exposed to multiple pesticides that may interact synergistically, amplifying their side effects. Attention has focused on neonicotinoid pesticides, but flupyradifur-one (FPF) is a novel butenolide insecticide that is also systemic and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. We therefore tested the lethal and sublethal toxic effects of FPF over different seasons and worker types, and the interaction of FPF with a common SBI fungicide, propiconazole. We provide the first demonstration of adverse synergistic effects on bee survival and behaviour (poor coordination, hyperactivity, apathy) even at FPF field-realistic doses (worst-case scenarios). Pesticide effects were significantly influenced by worker type and season. Foragers were consistently more susceptible to the pesticides (4-fold greater effect) than in-hive bees, and both worker types were more strongly affected by FPF in summer as compared with spring. Because risk assessment (RA) requires relatively limited tests that only marginally address bee behaviour and do not consider the influence of bee age and season, our results raise concerns about the safety of approved pesticides, including FPF. We suggest that pesticide RA also test for common chemical mixture synergies on behaviour and survival.","[Tosi, S.; Nieh, J.

The volume of production and consumption of drugs is such that they have become environmental pollutants. Their transfer to wastewater through urine, feces or rinsing in case of skin use, associated with partial elimination by wastewater treatment plants generalize pollution in the hydrosphere, including drinking water, sediments, soils, the food chain and plants. Here, we review the potential effects of environmental exposure to three classes of pharmaceutical drugs, i.e. antibiotics, antidepressants and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, on neurodevelopment. Experimental studies analyzing their underlying modes of action including those related to endocrine disruption, and molecular mechanisms including epigenetic modifications are presented. In addition, the contribution of brain imaging to the assessment of adverse effects of these three classes of pharmaceuticals is approached.","[Vaudin, Pascal; Just, Nathalie; Pillon, Delphine] Univ Tours, CNRS, PRC, INRAE,Physiol Reprod & Comportements,IFCE, F-37380 Nouzilly, France; [Auge, Corinne] Univ Tours, INSERM, IBrain, UMR 1253, F-37000 Tours, France; [Mhaouty-Kodja, Sakina] Sorbonne Univ, Neurosci Paris Seine Inst Biol Paris Seine, INSERM, CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France; [Mortaud, Stephane] Univ Orleans, CNRS, UMR7355, Immunol & Neurogenet Experimentales & Mol, F-45000 Orleans, France; [Just, Nathalie] Copenhagen Univ Hosp Hvidovre, Ctr Funct & Diagnost Imaging & Res, Danish Res Ctr Magnet Resonance, Hvidovre, Denmark",INRAE; Universite de Tours; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Tours; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Sorbonne Universite; Universite de Orleans; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); University of Copenhagen,"Vaudin, P (corresponding author), Univ Tours, CNRS, PRC, INRAE,Physiol Reprod & Comportements,IFCE, F-37380 Nouzilly, France.",pascal.vaudin@univ-tours.fr,"Just, Nathalie/HMO-9170-2023; GOUILLOU, Corinne AUGE/T-2346-2018","GOUILLOU, Corinne AUGE/0000-0002-3340-5560; Mortaud, Stephane/0000-0003-0873-4781; Mhaouty-Kodja, Sakina/0000-0001-9743-5243; Just, Nathalie/0000-0002-9401-0669",,,,,205,23,23,5,75,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0013-9351,1096-0953,,ENVIRON RES,Environ.

In particular, managed honey bees (Apis mellifera) face multiple health risks including nutritional stress, exposure to pests and pathogens, poor queen quality, and pesticide contamination, which cause problems at the individual and colony levels. One of the gravest problems faced by honey bees is parasitization by the mite Varroa destructor, which is typically controlled through the application of miticides such as tau-fluvalinate, coumaphos, and amitraz. In addition to miticides, colonies are also exposed to pesticides brought by foragers from agricultural settings, including the fungicide chlorothalonil and the insecticide chlorpyrifos. Here, we explored whether exposure of wax to combinations of these pesticides during development affects honey bee queen physiology and worker behavior. To do this, we reared queens in plastic cups coated with molten beeswax that was either pesticide-free or containing field-relevant concentrations of tau-fluvalinate and coumaphos, amitraz, or chlorothalonil and chlorpyrifos. Once queens mated naturally, we placed them in observation hives to measure egg-laying rate and worker retinue size. We then dissected the queens and used the contents of their mandibular glands to measure worker attractiveness in caged bioassays and to analyze their chemical components using GC-MS. Exposure of wax to field-relevant concentrations of the tested pesticides during queen development significantly lowered the adult queens' egg-laying rate and worker retinue size. Miticide exposure during development also lowered the attractiveness of queen mandibular gland contents to workers and affected the relative amounts of the glands' chemical components. Our results support the ideas that mandibular gland pheromones act as honest indicators of queen reproductive fitness and that pesticide exposure of wax during bee development is an important and concerning factor impairing honey bee health.","[Walsh, Elizabeth M.; Rangel, Juliana] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, 2475 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Sweet, Stephen; Knap, Anthony] Texas A&M Univ, Geochem Environm Res Grp, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Ing, Nancy] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Anim Sci, 2471 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Rangel, J (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, 2475 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",jrangel@tamu.edu,"Walsh, Elizabeth/GNM-6360-2022; Ing, Nancy/AAC-9927-2020","Walsh, Elizabeth/0000-0001-6209-7547; Ing, Nancy/0000-0002-5601-6971",Herb Dean Scholarship; USDA-NIFA award [2015-67013-23170]; California State Beekeepers Association; Texas A&M University's Hatch Project [TEX09557],Herb Dean Scholarship; USDA-NIFA award; California State Beekeepers Association; Texas A&M University's Hatch Project,"This work was supported in part by the Herb Dean Scholarship to cover EMW's tuition, funding to JR and NI by a USDA-NIFA award (2015-67013-23170), a grant from the California State Beekeepers Association, and Texas A&M University's Hatch Project (TEX09557).",,102,28,33,3,74,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.
