Animals can reduce the competition for a limiting resource by temporal segregation, whereby individuals exploit the resource at different times. However, the pay-offs may vary predictably over time, and it can be predicted that (a) more dominant competitors should gain access to resources at the preferred times and (b) the degree of temporal segregation will vary with the intensity of competition. 2. Here we show experimentally that individual brown trout Salmo trutta (L.) made sequential use of foraging areas, with dominant individuals feeding mainly at the most beneficial times of dusk and the early part of the night while more subordinate fish fed at other times. 3. However, the degree of overlap in foraging times between high-ranking fish was dependent on energetic demands. At low temperatures (when requirements were low) the temporal activity patterns of top-ranking fish were synchronized, with foraging concentrated at the preferred times. In contrast, when temperature was raised to increase energetic requirements, activity patterns showed strong temporal segregation: the most dominant fish remained predominantly nocturnal, whereas second-ranking fish became increasingly diurnal. 4. This is the first experimental demonstration of shifts in the daily pattern of activity caused by varying intensity of intraspecific competition.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquaculture, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Div Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Fish Biol Grp, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Glasgow,,anders.alanara@vabr.slu.se,"Metcalfe, Neil B./C-5997-2009","Metcalfe, Neil B./0000-0002-1970-9349",,,,,29,146,167,3,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The influence of two metal pollutants, mercuric chloride (HgCl2) and sodium azide (NaN3) on specific aggressive behaviours of the male Betta species was investigated. The aim was to determine if aggressive behaviour can be used as a metal pollution bio-indicator. For this purpose, two males were placed in an aquarium (60 x 25 x 25 cm) that was divided into two equal compartments by a clear, perforated Plexiglas wall. The aquarium was filled with untreated water as control, and with polluted water under experimental conditions. After 24 h, one male (intruder) was placed in the other male's (resident) half of the aquarium. The behaviour of both males, particularly, air gulping rate, latency to first bite and to first opercular expansion, were recorded. The results indicate that the males under treatment conditions were less aggressive than those under control conditions. Thus, the male Betta splendens aggressive behaviour can be potentially used as a biological indicator of pollutants in freshwater.","United Arab Emirates Univ, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",United Arab Emirates University,"Alyan, S (corresponding author), United Arab Emirates Univ, POB 1755, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",Salyan@uaeu.ac.ae,,,,,,,43,7,7,2,28,PARLAR SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS (P S P),FREISING,"ANGERSTR. 12, 85354 FREISING, GERMANY",1018-4619,1610-2304,,FRESEN ENVIRON BULL,Fresenius Environ.

Traditionally, female ornaments have been considered nonfunctional, being merely a genetically correlated response to selection for male ornamentation. However, this hypothesis is only relevant to species in which the ornament is basically the same in the two sexes. Alternatively, female ornaments may be influenced by selection acting directly on the females, either through female-female competition or male choice. We tested the latter hypothesis in mate-choice experiments with two-spotted gobies (Gobiusculus flavescens). In this small marine fish, females have bright yellow-orange bellies during the breeding season, a conspicuous trait that is not present in males. We conducted two aquarium experiments to test whether males preferred to mate with more colorful females. In the first experiment, males had a choice between two females that varied in natural coloration (and belly roundness). In the second experiment, we manipulated belly coloration and kept roundness constant. Males spent more time with colorful than with drab females in both experiments and also performed far more courtship displays toward colorful females. our study provides experimental evidence that males prefer ornamented females in a fish that is not sex-role reversed, supporting the hypothesis that female ornamentation is sexually selected.","Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Zool, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Ecol, Kristineberg Marine Res Stn, S-45034 Fiskebackskil, Sweden",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Gothenburg,"Amundsen, T (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Zool, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",trond.amundsen@chembio.ntnu.no,,"Amundsen, Trond/0000-0003-4261-0555",,,,,49,302,352,8,138,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

The acetate is administered to livestock via slow-release implants; some is converted by the animal to 17-beta-trenbolone, a relatively potent androgen receptor agonist in mammalian systems. Recent studies indicate that excreted 17-beta-trenbolone is comparatively stable in animal waste, suggesting the potential for exposure to aquatic animals via direct discharge, runoff, or both. However, little is known concerning the toxicity of trenbolone to fish. Our goal was to assess the effects of 17-beta-trenbolone on reproductive endocrinology of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). An in vitro competitive binding study with the fathead minnow androgen receptor demonstrated that 17-beta-trenbolone had a higher affinity for the receptor than that of the endogenous ligand, testosterone. Male and female fish were exposed for 21 d to nominal (target) concentrations of 17-beta-trenbolone ranging from 0.005 to 50 mug/L. Fecundity of the fish was significantly reduced by exposure to measured test concentrations greater than or equal to 0.027 mug/ L. The 17-beta-trenbolone was clearly androgenic in vivo at these concentrations, as evidenced by the de novo production in females of dorsal (nuptial) tubercles, structures normally present only on the heads of mature males. Plasma steroid (testosterone and beta-estradiol) and vitellogenin concentrations in the females all were significantly reduced by exposure to 17-beta-trenbolone. The 17-beta-trenbolone also altered reproductive physiology of male fathead minnows, albeit at concentrations much higher than those producing effects in females. Males exposed to 17-beta-trenbolone at 41 mug/L (measured) exhibited decreased plasma concentrations of 11-ketotestosterone and increased concentrations of beta-estradiol and vitellogenin. Overall, our studies indicate that 17-beta-trenbolone is a potent androgen and reproductive toxicant in fish. Given the widespread use of trenbolone acetate as a growth promoter, and relative stability of its metabolites in animal wastes, further studies are warranted to assess potential ecological risk.","US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Mid Continent Ecol Div, Duluth, MN 55804 USA; US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Expt Toxicol Div, Duluth, MN 55804 USA; Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Reprod Toxicol Div, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; United States Environmental Protection Agency; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Ankley, GT (corresponding author), US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Mid Continent Ecol Div, 6201 Congdon Blvd, Duluth, MN 55804 USA.",ankley.gerald@epa.gov,,"Denny, Jeff/0000-0002-1646-6177; Wilson, Vickie/0000-0003-1661-8481; gray jr, leon earl/0000-0002-1111-4754",,,,,50,326,385,2,113,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0730-7268,1552-8618,,ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM,Environ.

Small fish species, principally the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes), and zebrafish (Danio rerio), are used as model organisms for several of these testing pro-rams. Fish are appropriate models for testing EDCs, not only from the perspective of existing ecological impacts, but also in terms of species extrapolation. Specifically, there is a significant degree of conservation of basic aspects of the HPG axis across vertebrates, which provides a technically robust basis for using results from fish tests to predict likely modes/mechanisms of action of potential EDCs in other vertebrates. Different experimental designs/endpoints for, partial- and full-life cycle tests with fish that enable a consideration of a broad range of EDCs are described. Examples of results with specific chemicals in tests with the fathead minnow, medaka. and zebrafish are presented and discussed in terms of sensitivity and specificity for different classes of EDCs.","Natl Hlth & Environm Effects, Res Lab, US EPA, Off Res & Dev,Mid Continent Ecol Div, Duluth, MN USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Ankley, GT (corresponding author), Natl Hlth & Environm Effects, Res Lab, US EPA, Off Res & Dev,Mid Continent Ecol Div, Duluth, MN USA.",,"Johnson, Rodney/JXN-1278-2024",,,,,,96,201,246,2,82,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1084-2020,1930-6180,,ILAR J,ILAR J.,,2004,45,4,,,,,469,483,,10.1093/ilar.45.4.469,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ilar.45.4.469,,,15,Veterinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Veterinary Sciences,862GZ,15454686,Bronze,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000224480300010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Immunochemical analysis of plasma from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) exposed to 4-nonylphenol (NP) or to effluent from oil refinery treatment plant (ORTP), shows that NP and ORTP effluent induces Vtg and zona radiata proteins (Zrp) in a dose-dependent manner. However, Zrp-beta cross-reactive proteins are more responsive than Zrp-alpha, Zrp-gamma, and Vtg.

Swimming activity of fish was monitored continuously by using an automated video-monitoring and object-tracing system over a period of 17 days. Influenced by long-term exposure to microcystin-LR, Leucaspius delineatus reversed their significant diurnal swimming activity and the fish became statistically significant nocturnal. Danio rerio remained diurnal active, but a significant phase shift was registered. In both Danio rerio and Leucaspius delineatus analysis of time series by cosinor regression revealed microcystin-LR induced dose-dependent alterations of the mean of oscillation, amplitude, acrophase and period length in a different extent. For Danio rerio the periodogram analysis revealed a significant circadian component of swimming activity for control as well as exposure groups, whereby the spectral amplitude clearly decreased at microcystin-LR concentrations of 15 and 50 mu g l(-1). For Leucaspius delineatus the amplitude of circadian rhythm was decreased at all exposure concentrations of MC-LR. Furthermore the dominance of circadian rhythm was clearly reduced, whereas the rate of ultradian rhythms increased at elevated MC-LR concentrations of 5 mu g l(-1), 15 mu g l(-1) and 50 mu g l(-1). The studied temporal aspects of behaviour clearly indicated stress symptoms in both fish species, therefore it proved to be a relevant method to characterise the impact of toxic substances in the environment and for biomonitoring.","Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; Humboldt Univ, Inst Med Anthropol, D-10177 Berlin, Germany; Humboldt Univ, Inst Biol, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Baganz, D (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, POB 850119, D-12587 Berlin, Germany.",baganz@igb-berlin.de,"Staaks, Georg/AAR-7862-2021; Steinberg, Christian/O-8572-2019; Pflugmacher, Stephan/AHD-0910-2022","Staaks, Georg/0000-0003-3516-6767; Pflugmacher, Stephan/0000-0003-1052-2905; Steinberg, Christian E.W./0000-0002-3132-8901; Baganz, Daniela/0000-0002-0876-9100",,,,,34,11,12,1,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0929-1016,1744-4179,,BIOL RHYTHM RES,Biol.

Exposures to EE2 began within 2 to 5 d posthatch and continued until medaka were sexually mature, between four and six months of age. Among male and female medaka exposed to EE2 at nominal concentrations of 0.2 and 2 ng/L, mating behavior and reproductive success were normal in reproductive trials. However, reproductive behavior (i.e., copulations) was suppressed in the treatment with 10 ng/L EE2. Among 19 males exposed to 10 ng/L EE2 and placed with unexposed females in reproductive trials, 16 males did not copulate and reproductive success was very low. None of the females exposed to 10 ng/L of EE2 participated in reproductive behavior with unexposed males. The reproductive trials in combination with a histological survey indicated that male fish with gonadal intersex (i.e., testis-ova) were still capable of reproductive behavior and could fertilize eggs. Even though females exposed to 10 ng/L EE2 had poor reproductive success, their ovaries showed normal development and oogenesis. These data are relevant to observations of intersex in feral fish populations. Although intersex in male fish may be an indicator of exposure to estrogenic compounds, it appears that the presence of oocytes in testicular tissue may not directly impact the reproductive capability of the male fish. However, it is clear that concentrations of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that cause gonadal intersex are sufficient to reduce reproductive performance.","Trent Univ, Environm & Resource Studies Program, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada",Trent University,"Balch, GC (corresponding author), Trent Univ, Environm & Resource Studies Program, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada.",gbalch@trentu.ca,"Mackenzie, Constance/GRE-6965-2022",,,,,,42,112,135,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0730-7268,1552-8618,,ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM,Environ.

When used for habitat, the bioaccumulation potential of contaminants in the wastewater is a critical consideration. Water and fish samples collected from the Tres Rios Demonstration Constructed Wetlands near Phoenix, Arizona, which uses secondary-treated wastewater to maintain an aquatic ecosystem in a desert environment, were analyzed for hydrophobic organic compounds (HOC) and trace elements. Semipermeable membrane devices (SPMD) were deployed to investigate uptake of HOC. The wetlands effectively removed HOC, and concentrations of herbicides, pesticides, and organic wastewater contaminants decreased 40-99% between inlet and outlet. Analysis of Tilapia, mossambica and Gambusia affinis indicated accumulation of HOC, including p,p'-DDE and trans-nonachlor. The SPMD accumulated the HOC detected in the fish tissue as well as additional compounds. Trace-element concentrations in whole-fish tissue were highly variable, but were similar between the two species. Concentrations of HOC and trace elements varied in different fish tissue compartments, and concentrations in Tilapia liver tissue were greater than those in the whole organism or filet tissue.

In mammals, these chemicals bind the androgen receptor and prevent the transcription of the associated genes causing abnormal sexual development and demasculinization. There are few similar studies in fish and so far it has not been demonstrated that these chemicals have any antiandrogenic effects in this group. In the present study, juvenile guppies (Poccilia reticulata) were fed sublethal doses of vinclozolin, p,p'-DDE or flutamide from birth to adulthood. At sexual maturity, we measured a suite of male sexual characteristics that are known to be under androgen control. All three chemicals caused a reduction in the orange display coloration, inhibited gonopodium development. reduced the sperm count and suppressed courtship behaviour, in a manner consistent with antiandrogen action. Only the gonodosomatic index was unaffected by the treatments. In addition, the three chemicals skewed the sex ratio at adulthood and caused delayed maturation. The altered characters are all considered to be important for male mating success and their impairment indicates that antiandrogens may seriously compromise male reproductive fitness.

This potential threat to animal populations posed by xenoestrogens has, hardly surprisingly, been met by an intensive global effort to identify and develop biomarkers suitable for screening chemicals for estrogen mimicking capacity. Despite this effort, there are few biomarkers capable of linking exposure to xenoestrogens to impaired reproductive capability. The reproductive success of most animals depends strongly on the ability to perform the appropriate sexual behavior. The sexual display of the male guppy is strongly linked to reproductive success and is readily quantified under laboratory conditions. This preliminary study demonstrates that exposure of adult male guppies to water weakly contaminated with either natural estrogen (17 beta-estradiol) or the xenoestrogen (4-tert-octylphenol) causes a dramatic decrease in the rate and intensity of sexual display, It is concluded that quantitative analysis of the sexual display of male guppies holds great promise as a biomarker at the organismal level for the effects of estrogen mimicking xenobiotics.

Here, we determined if this phenomenon is widespread among cyprinid fishes by adding 17 alpha-methyltestosterone (MT) to aquaria containing juveniles of 4 cyprinid species (tinfoil barbs; redtail sharkminnows, Epalzeorhynchos bicolor; gold fish, Carassius auratus; zebrafish, Danio rerio) and then using electro-olfactogram (EOG) recordings and behavioral assays to determine if androgen treatment enhances pheromone detection and male sex behaviors. In all 4 cyprinids, MT treatment increased the magnitudes and sensitivities of EOG response to prostaglandins and, consistent with our initial study on tinfoil barbs, did not affect EOG responses to the free and conjugated steroid to which each species is most sensitive. In zebrafish, EOG responses to prostaglandins were similar in MT-treated juveniles and adult males, whereas responses of control (ethanol exposed) fish were similar to those of adult females. Finally, as previously observed in tinfoil barbs, MT treatment of juvenile redtail sharkminnows increased courtship behaviors (nuzzling and quivering) with a stimulus fish. We conclude that androgen-induced increase in olfactory responsiveness to pheromonal prostaglandins is common among the family Cyprinidae. This phenomenon will help us unravel the development of sexually dimorphic olfactory-mediated behavior.","[Belanger, Rachelle M.; Pachkowski, Melanie D.; Stacey, Norm E.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Stacey, NE (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",nstacey@ualberta.ca,"Belanger, Rachelle M./I-7888-2019","Belanger, Rachelle M./0000-0003-3902-9276",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Alberta Ingenuity,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Alberta Ingenuity,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada grant to N.E.S.; postdoctoral fellowships from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Alberta Ingenuity to R.M.B.,,59,35,39,0,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0379-864X,1464-3553,,CHEM SENSES,Chem.

This study examined the relationship between plasma levels of gonadal steroids and behaviour and the effects of exogenous hormonal perturbation on the behaviour of nesting male three-spined stickleback. Plasma gonadal steroid concentrations were related to levels of nesting and aggressive behaviours: levels of oestradiol were negatively related to courtship behaviours while levels of 11-ketotestosterone were negatively related to nesting behaviours. The behaviour of male three-spined stickleback exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of an endocrine disrupter differed from the behaviour of control males. Control males increased their aggressive response to a live male conspecific over time, while males exposed to ethinyl oestradiol decreased their aggressive response.

In this study, chronic exposure of threespined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to an environmentally relevant level of an EDC used in the birth control pill and post-menopausal hormone replacement therapy produced changes in growth and behavior that were related to fitness. Exposure to 100 ng/l ethinyl estradiol accelerated growth rate and increased levels of behavior that makes individuals more susceptible to predation (activity and foraging under predation risk). Moreover, the costs of exposure to ethinyl estradiol took their ultimate toll via mortality later in life, and were particularly high for females and for one population.

Although pp'DDT usage was strongly limited or banned in most parts of the world during the last three or four decades, the parent compound, its homologues and their metabolites still Occur it levels which might pose a risk for many ecosystem components. A case of DDT Pollution of industrial origin was discovered in 1996 in Lake Maggiore, the second largest (212 km(2)) and deepest (370 in) lake in Italy, Causing concern for wildlife and human health. The extensive monitoring of many biotic and abiotic compartments which followed from 1998 ill order to assess the pollution level and its trend in time, provided a great availability of data referring to DDT contamination of the different fish species of the lake. In this study, the recent contamination levels in selected fish species were compared to those measured in 1998 to evaluate the temporal pollution trend of the lake and its natural recovery, given that no remediation measures were carried out on the contaminated soils and sediments in this time span. Moreover, a modelling approach to test the equilibrium condition between water and pelagic fish species was used. Analytical results of pp'DDT and pp'DDE concentrations in lake water were used as input data in the bioenergetic model by Connolly & Pedersen (1988) to calculate concentrations in two fish species and to compare the predicted and the measured contamination. Methods. Sampling and analytical determination of DDT homologues ill lake water: Five water sampling campaigns were carried Out from May 2002 to February 2004 in three sampling sites of Lake Maggiore. Suspended and dissolved pollutants were determined separately. Quantitative DDT homologue analyses were performed by HRGC coupled with ECD detection by the external standard method. Single water extracts were put together in correspondence with the stratification zones of the water column inferred oil the basis of the temperature profile to improve analytical sensitivity. Selection of fish data: Concentrations of DDT and DDE in fishes were selected from recent literature (CIPAIS 2003, 2004). Bioaccumulation model: The bioenergetic model proposed by Connolly & Pedersen (1988) was used to assess the bioaccumulation of pp'DDT and pp'DDE of Alosa fallax (landlocked shad) and Coregonus spp. (whitefish), selected among the different species as representative of a secondary consumer level. Results and Discussion. The average concentrations of pp'DDT and pp 'DDE in water to be used as input data in the bioenergetic model were obtained considering ill the concentrations measured at the three sampling stations in the epylimnion where the fish species considered in this stud), spend most of their life. The resulting values were 0.05 and 0.16 ng/L for pp'DDT and pp'DDE, respectively. Average measured pp'DDT and pp'DDE concentrations in landlocked shad were 0.81 +/- 0.39 and 1.69 +/- 0.71 mg/kg lipids, respectively, and were 0.29 +/- 0.12 and 1.06 +/- 0.41 mg/kg lipids for the whitefish. Calculated and measured values turned Out to be in quite good agreement for pp'DDT, while measured pp'DDE concentrations were higher than expected on the basis of the bioenergetic model in both species. Probably metabolic transformations of pp'DDT accumulated in fish tissues in the past are responsible for the observed differences between calculated and expected pp'DDE concentrations in fish. Conclusions. Pelagic fishes of Lake Maggiore seem to maintain the DDT accumulated during their life time and the most efficient mechanism responsible for the fish population recoveries is probably their generation changes; for this reason, equilibrium models cannot be used until negligible pp'DDT concentrations are reached in fish tissues. Recommendations and Outlook. The limit proposed for pp'DDT in water by the EU Directive 2000/60, which will come in force in 2008, is 0.2 ng/L, four times higher than the average concentration measured in Lake Maggiore waters. Nevertheless, concentrations measured in Lake Maggiore fish were very close and sometimes exceeded the Maximum residue limits (MRLs) settled by the Italian legislation for foods (0.1 mg/kg w.w. for fish containing 5-20% lipid). It seems, therefore, that the 'environmental quality standard' of 0.2 ng/L cannot guarantee the Suitability of fish for human consumption.","Univ Insubria, Chem & Environm Sci Dep, I-22100 Como, Italy; Chemserv Srl, I-20026 Novate Milanese, Mi, Italy; Univ Milan, Dept Biol, I-20133 Milan, Italy",University of Insubria; University of Milan,"Bettinetti, R (corresponding author), Univ Insubria, Chem & Environm Sci Dep, Via Valleggio,11, I-22100 Como, Italy.",roberta.bettinetti@uninsubria.it,"Bettinetti, Roberta/AAD-7072-2019","VOLTA, Pietro/0000-0003-3177-0473",,,,,27,26,30,0,34,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Two methods of exposure were employed, via ingestion at 0, 1, 10 and 100 ug/g food and via the water at 0, 1 and 10 mug/l. The fish were exposed fur 74-28 days during the spawning period. The males were then paired with an artificially induced, spawning female and their sexual behaviour was observed during a 15 min period. The physiological status of the fish was also examined with respect to GSI. presence of milt and spawning tubercles and the blood plasma concentration of E-2. Despite the relatively short exposure period. exposure to physiological levels of E-2 was shown to severely affect the male goldfish reproductive behaviour and physiology. In conclusion, the results from this study and the ability to interpret the effects on this well-studied species, show that the effects of E-2, and possibly other estrogenic EDCs have severe effects at several vital levels of male goldfish reproduction. The results also suggests that the hormone E-2 can act as an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) in the environment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Thus, it is important to understand the nature of pollution-induced change in aquatic ecosystems. We show that brown bullheads (Ameiurus nebulosus) may have evolved in response to chronic pollution exposure. We collected adults from the Detroit River (polluted site) and Belle River (control site). Both adults and common-garden raised juveniles were tested for aggression, locomotion, and escape response using consecutive unchallenged (clean) and challenged (polluted) trials. Detroit River fish were more aggressive than Belle River fish when challenged. Furthermore, Belle River fish showed increased locomotion when exposed to pollutants, whereas Detroit River fish were unaffected. The consistent difference in adult and juvenile behaviour across trials suggests a genetic response to pollution. Escape response on the other hand, showed inter-population differences, but no consistency between adults and juveniles, indicating that this behaviour is influenced by non-genetic factors. We discuss our data with respect to the potential adaptation of populations to pollution and the implications for prioritizing remediation efforts.","[Breckels, Ross D.; Neff, Bryan D.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Neff, BD (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",bneff@uwo.ca,,"Neff, Bryan/0000-0001-8499-250X",NSERC; University of Western Ontario,NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); University of Western Ontario,"We thank T.

We investigated the implications of this by analyzing the combined effects of a multicomponent mixture of five estrogenic chemicals using vitellogenin induction in male fathead minnows as an end point. The mixture consisted of estradioll ethynylestradiol, nonylphenol, octylphenol, and bisphenol A. We determined concentration-response curves for each of the chemicals individually. The chemicals were then combined at equipotent concentrations and the mixture tested using fixed-ratio design. The effects of the mixture were compared with those predicted by the model of concentration addition using biomathematical methods, which revealed that there was no deviation between the observed and predicted effects of the mixture. These findings demonstrate that estrogenic chemicals have the capacity to act together in an additive manner and that their combined effects can be accurately predicted by concentration addition. We also explored the potential for mixture effects at low concentrations by exposing the fish to each chemical at one-fifth of its median effective concentration (EC50)Individually, the chemicals did not induce a significant response, although their combined effects were consistent with the predictions of concentration addition. This demonstrates the potential for estrogenic chemicals to act additively at environmentally relevant concentrations. These findings highlight the potential for existing environmental risk assessment procedures to underestimate the hazard posed by mixtures of chemicals that act via a similar mode of action, thereby leading to erroneous conclusions of absence of risk.","Brunel Univ, Inst Environm, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; Univ London Sch Pharm, Ctr Toxicol, London, England; Univ Bremen, Dept Biol & Chem, Bremen, Germany; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci, I-30123 Venice, Italy",Brunel University; University of London; University College London; University of London School of Pharmacy; University of Bremen; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Brian, JV (corresponding author), Brunel Univ, Inst Environm, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",jayne.brian@brunel.ac.uk,"Lamoree, Marja H/N-4396-2013; Backhaus, Thomas/E-7375-2014; sumpter, john/HGB-7584-2022; Booij, Petra/L-3525-2013; Runnalls, Tamsin/IAM-5423-2023","Lamoree, Marja H/0000-0002-7373-7738; Backhaus, Thomas/0000-0001-9643-1662; Runnalls, Tamsin/0000-0002-0508-5803",,,,,45,302,358,6,136,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

Resistance to chemical stress, however, can evolve and the mechanisms include desensitized target sites, reduced chemical uptake and increased metabolic detoxification and sequestration. Chemical resistance in wildlife populations can also arise independently of exposure and may be spread by gene flow between populations. Inbreeding-matings between closely related individuals - can have negative fitness consequences for natural populations, and there is evidence of inbreeding depression in many wildlife populations. In some cases, reduced fitness in inbred populations has been shown to be exacerbated under chemical stress. In chemical testing, both inbred and outbred laboratory animals are used and for human safety assessments, isogenic strains (virtual clones) of mice and rats are often employed that reduce response variation, the number of animals used and associated costs. In contrast, for environmental risk assessment, strains of animals are often used that have been selectively bred to maintain heterozygosity, with the assumption that they are better able to predict adverse effects in wild, genetically variable, animals. This may not necessarily be the case however, as one outbred strain may not be representative of another or of a wild population. In this paper, we critically discuss relationships between genetic variation, inbreeding and chemical effects with the intention of seeking to support more effective chemical testing for the protection of wildlife.","[Brown, A.

A multi-stage Delay Differential Equation fish population model was used to simulate the perch population during two periods when it showed contrasting population structures (1968-1973 and 1983-1988) as the result of a disease outbreak in 1976, and to extrapolate the effects of chemical exposure to EE2 and NP observed in the laboratory to the environment. In the absence of chemical exposure, model simulations predicted population numbers (females) in line with those derived from field survey data. Effects predictions were made for long-term exposure (20 years) to low and high doses of EE2 (1 and 10 ng l(-1)) and NP (1 and 30 mu g l(-1)). The sustained high-level exposure of EE2 had a high probability of causing the extinction of a confined fish population such as that in Windermere, however, such an exposure scenario is unlikely. Far greater uncertainty surrounds the prediction of effects due to low-level exposure of fish populations and even though effects may appear to be significant in laboratory studies, such as fecundity lowered by 30%, they may not necessarily translate into significant population effects in the field. This is especially true if life-history data show high natural variability in terms of individual vital rates. Our work suggests that for a decline in the perch population numbers to be significant in Windermere, it would have to be substantially more than 50%. Our model predictions indicated that the post-disease population was generally more vulnerable than the pre-disease population and had a significantly greater probability of declining by 50% following single chemical exposure, but both populations were equally likely to decline following multiple chemical exposure. Rate of population recovery was shown to be a more sensitive measure in terms of differentiating the effects of low and high chemical exposure as well as the vulnerability of populations with contrasting structures, histories or levels of background stress.

Although experimental studies have shown that females often mate with dominant males, it may not always be in the interest of a female to do so. Here we investigated the impact of male dominance on female mate choice and offspring growth and survival in the rose bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus), a freshwater fish with a resource-based mating system. Three experimental mating trials were conducted using males of known dominance rank, but with different levels of constraint on male behavior. Thus, females were able to choose among; (1) males that were isolated from each other; (2) males that could see and smell each other, but could not directly interact; (3) males that could interact fully. Using a combination of behavioral observation and parentage analyses it was shown that female preferences did not correspond with male dominance and that male aggression and dominance constrained female mate choice, resulting in a potential intersexual conflict. The survival of offspring to independence was significantly correlated with female mate preferences, but not with male dominance. A lack of strong congruence in female preference for males suggested a role for parental haplotype compatibility in mate choice.","[Casalini, Mara; Agbali, Muna; Reichard, Martin; Smith, Carl] Univ Leicester, Dept Biol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Casalini, Mara] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Reichard, Martin; Konecna, Marketa; Bryjova, Anna] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Vertebrate Biol, CS-60365 Brno, Czech Republic",University of Leicester; University of Padua; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Vertebrate Biology of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Casalini, M (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Dept Biol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",cs152@le.ac.uk,"Smith, Carl/A-2254-2015; Smith, Carl/HJP-3385-2023; Mrkvova, Marketa/G-1107-2014; Reichard, Martin/C-6563-2009; ASCR, IVB/A-9883-2011","Smith, Carl/0000-0003-3285-0379; Mrkvova, Marketa/0000-0002-6221-531X; Reichard, Martin/0000-0002-9306-0074;",MSM [LC06073]; CR [B600930501],"MSM(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic); CR","We thank Dr J.- Kitamura and Dr R.

We manipulated the number of males (1, 2 or 4) and females (2, 4, 8 or 16) in a factorial design to investigate mating competition and courtship rate in Japanese medaka, a species with conventional sex roles, over a broad range of OSRs (0.0625 to 2), and in relation to the density of both sexes. As predicted, the rates of intrasexual interactions by both males and females increased with the number of competitors and decreased with the number of potential mates, whereas the rates of courtship decreased with the number of competitors and increased with the number of mates. At OSRs between 0.35 and 2, males engaged in more intrasexual interactions and courtship behaviour than females. However, females became the more competitive sex at OSRs less than 0.35, and engaged in more courtship than males at OSRs greater than 2, rather than at an OSR of 1, as predicted by conventional mating system theory. Our results indicate that OSR can predict the considerable within-sex variability in reproductive behaviour of both males and females, regardless of which sex is more competitive.

These chemicals, commonly referred to as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (hereafter EDCs), pose a particularly severe threat to animal health. They accumulate in body tissues and are highly persistent in the environment and thus can occur at significant concentrations far from their points of origin. Ecotoxicologists have used a number of animal species to identify physiological and morphological consequences of EDC exposure. Effects of exposure have typically been measured in terms of survival, development or aspects of reproductive anatomy and physiology. In recent years, ecotoxicologists have begun using behavioural endpoints as components of standard toxicological assays. There has been a concurrent although less widespread interest among animal behaviourists in understanding and studying the effects of these contaminants on animal behaviour. The purposes of this review are four-fold. First, we provide a primer on EDCs. Second, we summarize current knowledge about endocrine disruption of animal behaviour. Third, we describe the role that we envision for behaviour in the field of ecotoxicology. Finally, we hope to stimulate a dialogue between animal behaviourists and ecotoxicologists that will enhance our understanding of these environmental contaminants and their impacts on animal populations.

It is fundamental therefore to understand any such effects for effective risk assessment. This study investigated the impact of a transient exposure to ethinylestradiol (EE2) during early life (from 20-60 days post fertilization), including at a dosing level within the environmental range, on the subsequent reproductive behavior and success in both male and female zebrafish (Danio rerio) in competitive breeding scenarios. There were no obvious effects of the early life EE2 exposures on the subsequent gonadal phenotypes in either mature males or females. In fact, reproductive success in males exposed to 2.76 ng EE2/L was increased in competitive spawning scenarios. In contrast, exposure of females to EE2 (9.86 ng/L) during early life reduced their subsequent reproductive success in competitive spawning scenarios. Mate choice experiments suggested this was a consequence of the females' diminished courting behavior toward males, rather than any male preference for unexposed females. Reproductive capability of females is generally considered a key determinant in population demographics and dynamics, and therefore the effect of exposure to EE2 on female reproductive success may have significant implications for exposed fish populations.","[Coe, Tobias S.; Soeffker, Marta K.; Filby, Amy L.; Tyler, Charles R.] Univ Exeter, Ecotoxicol & Aquat Biol Res Grp, Exeter, Devon, England; [Hodgson, David] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter,"Tyler, CR (corresponding author), Hatherly Labs, Prince Wales Rd, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",,"Filby, Amy L/F-8546-2010; Soeffker, M/KBC-2650-2024; Soeffker, M/D-3258-2009","Soeffker, M/0000-0002-7131-5486; Hodgson, Dave/0000-0003-4220-2076",,,,,63,46,53,1,67,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

This study investigated the effect of short-term exposure of male adult zebrafish to 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) on subsequent reproductive output and parentage in colonies with differing numbers of competing males. It was predicted that impacts of EDCs might differ in social groups of fish of differing size because of the greater costs of maintaining dominance hierarchies in large groups. Adult male zebrafish were exposed for 14 days to clean water, 2 ng/L EE2 or 10 ng/L via the water, prior to placement into colonies in clean water with unexposed females, Exposure to EE2 at the concentrations adopted prior to the breeding trials did not significantly affect subsequent colony reproductive output. The reproductive success of the most reproductively successful (MRS) male within colonies containing two males (relative to controls) was also unaffected. There was, however, a significant impact of previous EE2 exposure in tanks containing four males, resulting in a reduction in paternity for the most successful male. Hence, nonlethal behavioral impacts of even short-term exposure to EDCs can have significant impacts on social dominance hierarchies and population genetic diversity.","[Coe, Tobias S.; Hamilton, Patrick B.; Paull, Gregory C.; Tyler, Charles R.] Univ Exeter, Ecotoxicol & Aquat Biol Res Grp, Exeter, Devon, England; [Hodgson, David] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter,"Tyler, CR (corresponding author), Hatherly Lab, Prince Wales Rd, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",C.R.Tyler@exeter.ac.uk,,"Hodgson, Dave/0000-0003-4220-2076","U.K. Environment Agency, Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; University of Exeter; NERC [NE/G019355/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G019355/1] Funding Source: researchfish","U.K. Environment Agency, Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); University of Exeter; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","We thank Jan Shears, Tessa Scown, and Amy Filby at the University of Exeter and Alexander Scott (EE2 radioimmunoassay) at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, for their assistance with the practical work.

Exposure to some estrogens, at concentrations found in the environment, impairs reproductive function and behavior. However, nearly all work on endocrine disruption has investigated the effects of exposure on individuals and there is an urgent need to understand impacts on populations. Many fish have mating systems with complex social structures and it is not known whether EDCs will exaggerate or buffer the reproductive skews caused by the dominance hierarchies that normally occur for these species. This study investigated the impact of exposure to the pharmaceutical estrogen ethinylestradiol (EE2) on reproductive hierarchies and sexual selection in group-spawning fish. Breeding zebrafish were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2, and effects were determined on reproductive output, plasma androgen concentrations (in males), and reproductive success through microsatellite analyses of the offspring. Reproductive hierarchies in breeding colonies of zebrafish were disrupted by exposure to EE2 at a concentration that did not affect the number of eggs produced. The effect was a reduction in the skew in male paternity and increased skew in female maternity. This disruption in the reproductive hierarchy in group spawning fish, if it occurs in the wild, has potentially major implications for population genetic diversity. Reproductive success in male zebrafish was associated with elevated plasma concentrations of the male sex hormone 11-ketotestosterone and this hormone was suppressed in EE2-exposed males.","[Coe, Tobias S.; Hamilton, Patrick B.; Paull, Gregory C.; Tyler, Charles R.] Univ Exeter, Ecotoxicol & Aquat Biol Res Grp, Exeter, Devon, England; [Hodgson, David] Univ Exeter Cornwall Campus, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn, Cornwall, England; [Stevens, Jamie R.; Sumner, Katie] Univ Exeter, Mol Ecol & Evolut Grp, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter; University of Exeter,"Coe, TS (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Ecotoxicol & Aquat Biol Res Grp, Exeter, Devon, England.",tsc202@ex.ac.uk,"Stevens, Jamie/O-7216-2019","Stevens, Jamie/0000-0002-1317-6721; Hodgson, Dave/0000-0003-4220-2076",,,,,50,85,100,2,90,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

It is excreted from the human body in high amounts and released via sewage treatment plant effluent into aquatic environments. In fish, estrogen receptors have strong binding affinities for EE2, and exposure raises the possibility of adverse neuroendocrine responses in aquatic animals. In the present study we explored the effects of dissolved-phase EE2 on the dynamics of male-male aggression and courtship behaviors in adult zebrafish. Further, we assessed whether the behavioral effects of EE2 result in changes in male offspring paternity. We scored the aggressive behaviors of individual unexposed males and categorized these fish as either dominant or subordinate. We then exposed dominant males to EE2 at doses of 0, 0.5. 5.0, and 50.0 ng/L for 48 h. Subsequent trials examined the agonistic behaviors of males in two testing scenarios: (1) a dyadic encounter with another male alone, and (2) a competitive spawning interaction with another male and three adult females. Competitive spawning tests were also used to assess the impacts of EE2 exposure on courtship behavior and paternity using males that were homozygous for green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression under the control of the islet-1 promoter. We found that EE2 at all exposure concentrations reduced male aggression during male-male dyadic encounters and caused a social dominance reversal in 50% of the fish at the highest exposure dose (50 ng/L EE2). The frequency of courtship-specific behavior decreased in dominant males exposed to the steroid, though this effect was only significant for the lowest dose group (0.5 ng/L EE2) In the highest exposure group (50 ng/L EE2), 50% of dominant males relinquished paternal dominance. Our results show that short-term exposure to EE2 at environmentally relevant levels can alter aggression, and shift individual social status and reproductive success in male zebrafish.

Such scenarios may be common in many fishes and amphibians, yet their ramifications remain largely unexplored. We used a simple model to study the (short-term) population consequences of environmental sex reversal (ESR). We examined the effects on sex ratios, sex chromosome frequencies, and population growth and persistence after exposure to environmental forces with feminizing or masculinizing tendencies. When environmental feminization was strong, X chromosomes were driven to extinction. Analogously, extinction of normally male-linked genetic factors (e.g., Y chromosomes) was caused by continuous environmental masculinization. Although moderate feminization was beneficial for population growth in the absence of large viability effects, our results suggest that the consequences of ESR are generally negative in terms of population size and the persistence of sex chromosomes. Extreme sex ratios resulting from high rates of ESR also reduced effective population sizes considerably. This may limit any evolutionary response to the deleterious effects of ESR. Our findings suggest that ESR changes population growth and sex ratios in some counter-intuitive ways and can change the predominant factor in sex determination from genetic to fully environmental, often within only a few tens of generations. Populations that lose genetic sex determination may quickly go extinct if the environmental forces that cause sex reversal cease.","[Cotton, Samuel] UCL, Res Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, London NW1 2HE, England; [Cotton, Samuel; Wedekind, Claus] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of London; University College London; University of Lausanne,"Cotton, S (corresponding author), UCL, Res Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, Wolfson House,4 Stephenson Way, London NW1 2HE, England.",s.cotton@ucl.ac.uk,"Wedekind, Claus/S-3353-2016","Wedekind, Claus/0000-0001-6143-4716",Swiss National Science Foundation; NERC,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Financial support was provided by the Swiss National Science Foundation and a NERC Fellowship to S.C.

Newly fertilized eggs containing trace levels of PCBs via maternal deposition were collected from an aquaculture pond in which adult broodstock had been reared over their natural lives. The eggs were incubated using a flow through system that received the same pond water at in-situ temperatures from which they were spawned. Replicate samples of eggs were collected at six time points throughout incubation, ranging from day 0 (newly fertilized eggs) to post-hatch larvae (2-d old). Congener specific PCB fugacities in pooled egg samples showed increases over the incubation period. just prior to hatching, incubated eggs averaged 2.7-fold higher PCB fugacities compared to fresh eggs. The increase in PCB fugacity with egg incubation time was independent of chemical Kow. After hatching, PCB residues were lost from the larvae, attenuating the maximum chemical fugacity achieved in late-incubated eggs. However, the rate of PCB elimination in the early larvae stages was K-ow dependent such that a significant larvae/egg fugacity ratio was still evident for intermediate and highly hydrophobic compounds 2 d post-hatching. This study provides the first evidence of in-ovo PCB bioamplification in eggs of an aquatic species and suggests that incubating fish embryos are exposed to higher chemical fugacities in-ovo than would be predicted by maternal deposition alone.

Pair matings of adult zebrafish confirmed that the courtship behavior sequence fell into three general phases: initiatory, receptive/appetitive, and spawning. The developmental onset of identifiable courtship behaviors was also studied. Interestingly, the progression of behaviors in a typical bout of adult courtship was found to recapitulate the ontogeny of the courtship components as they were first expressed in juvenile fish. This finding suggests that the systems controlling the maturation and sequential expression of behaviors stimulated the expression of the later ones. This idea is consistent with the finding that courtship displays of immature fish were stimulated if they were housed with adults for a short period of time. This characterization of courtship display in zebrafish, including its development, opens the door to a forward genetic analysis of vertebrate reproductive behavior.","[Darrow, Kiersten O.; Harris, William A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Anat, Cambridge CB2 3DY, England",University of Cambridge,"Harris, WA (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Anat, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3DY, England.",harris@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk,,,Wellcome Trust,Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust),Support provided by the Wellcome Trust.,,14,113,133,4,47,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC,NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1545-8547,,,ZEBRAFISH,Zebrafish,,2004,1,1,,,,,40,45,,10.1089/154585404774101662,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/154585404774101662,,,6,Developmental Biology; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Developmental Biology; Zoology,V18CU,18248204,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000207983700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In rats, the estrogenic environment during pregnancy and lactation affects directly maternal behavior. This experiment was aimed to test whether the exposure to the estrogenic compound bisphenol-A (BPA; 0.040 mg/kg/die, orally) of adult female rats, from mating to weaning of the pups, could alter maternal behavior. An appropriate methodology was applied to reveal differences in the behavior of dams directed to male and female pups, testing the dams on postnatal days 3-4 and 8-9. Results show different maternal behavioral patterns towards male and female pups of control mothers, with more ano-genital licking to males than to females. Exposure of mothers to BPA modified their behavior, reducing specific components of maternal behavior, both active and passive, irrespective of the sex of pups and the period of observation. This experiment shows that maternal behavior is affected by a prolonged exposure to a low dose of BPA during pregnancy and lactation, thus suggesting an effect on neural circuits in adulthood.

Here we further validate zebrafish models of stress by analyzing how environmental and pharmacological manipulations affect their behavioral and physiological phenotypes. Experimental manipulations included exposure to alarm pheromone, chronic exposure to fluoxetine, acute exposure to caffeine, as well as acute and chronic exposure to ethanol. Acute (but not chronic) alarm pheromone and acute caffeine produced robust anxiogenic effects, including reduced exploration, increased erratic movements and freezing behavior in zebrafish tested in the novel tank diving test. In contrast, ethanol and fluoxetine had robust anxiolytic effects, including increased exploration and reduced erratic movements. The behavior of several zebrafish strains was also quantified to ascertain differences in their behavioral profiles, revealing high-anxiety (leopard, albino) and low-anxiety (wild type) strains. We also used LocoScan (CleverSys Inc.) video-tracking tool to quantify anxiety-related behaviors in zebrafish, and dissect anxiety-related phenotypes from locomotor activity. Finally, we developed a simple and effective method of measuring zebrafish physiological stress responses (based on a human salivary cortisol assay), and showed that alterations in whole-body cortisol levels in zebrafish parallel behavioral indices of anxiety. Collectively, our results confirm zebrafish as a valid, reliable, and high-throughput model of stress and affective disorders. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The in vivo method assessed the rate of gonopodial development (masculinization) and alterations from normal reproductive behavior in adult female mosquitofish exposed for 21 d to untreated or secondary-treated pulp mill effluent. A second in vivo mosquitofish exposure tested the effect of glass-fiber (type C) filtration of secondary-treated effluent on rates of expression of the same endpoints. Extractable organics analyses of effluents and extracts thereof were conducted. Mosquitofish demonstrated significant masculinization on exposure to either treated or untreated effluent; the frequency of gonopodial development was reduced with effluent secondary-treatment. Male mating behavior was observed in the masculinized adult females. Glass-fiber (type F) filtration of the treated effluent eliminated the masculinizing effect, suggesting that the bioactive compounds were associated with the suspended solids. The in vitro method measured the binding of compounds within a treated thermomechanical/bleached kraft effluent extract to androgen receptors contained in goldfish testis cytosol. Exposure to extracts of either the particulate (glass-fiber filtered) or the dissolved organic fraction of the effluent produced significant binding (as indicated by the displacement of radiolabeled testosterone) to the androgen receptor in goldfish gonadal tissue. Thus, the dissolved organics extract of the treated effluent contained compounds androgenic to goldfish in vitro but not to mosquitofish in vivo. The combined in vitro and in vivo data suggest that the effluent in question could exert effects on the reproductive physiology of fishes through an androgenic mechanism. The androgenic compounds androstenedione and testosterone were not detected in the extracts used for the in vitro component of this study.","Forest Res, Rotorua, New Zealand; Ryerson Polytech Inst, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany",Scion; Toronto Metropolitan University; University of Konstanz,"Van Den Heuvel, MR (corresponding author), Forest Res, Private Bag 3020,Sala St, Rotorua, New Zealand.",mike.vandenheuvel@forestresearch.co.nz,"Dietrich, Daniel/AAP-8698-2021; van+den+Heuvel, Michael/ABF-1188-2020; Stuthridge, Trevor/B-7663-2013",,,,,,35,88,101,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0730-7268,1552-8618,,ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM,Environ.

In a first experiment we exposed these fishes to an equally toxic Cu dose, a Cu level 10 times lower than their 96 h LC50 value: 20, 65, and 150 mu g/L Cu. In a second series we exposed them to the same Cu concentration (50 mu g/L). Na+/K+-ATPase activity in gill tissue was disturbed differently in rainbow trout then in common and gibel carp. Rainbow trout showed a thorough disruption of plasma ion levels at the beginning of both exposures, whereas common carp and gibel carp displayed effects only after 3 days. Rainbow trout and common carp thyroid hormones experienced adverse effects in the beginning of the exposure. The involvement of prolactin in handling metal stress was reflected in changes of mRNA prolactin receptor concentrations in gill tissue, with an up regulation of this mRNA in rainbow trout and a down regulation in gibel carp, which was more pronounced in the latter. Overall, rainbow trout appeared more sensitive in the beginning of the exposure, however, when it overcame this first challenge, it handled copper exposure in a better manner then common and gibel carp as they showed more long term impacts of Cu exposure.

This study reports the biotransformation, bioconcentration and tissue distribution of the xenoestrogen 4-tert-octylphenol (t-OP) in juvenile rainbow trout. Fish were exposed for 10 days to a concentration of 4 mug/l of [C-14] t-OP in a flow-through system and were sampled after 1, 4, 7 and 10 days of exposure. t-OP residues were extracted from all tissues and analysed by radio-high-performance liquid chromatography. After 1 day of exposure radioactive residues were detected in all tissues and reached steady state conditions in the whole fish after 4 days of exposure. The concentration of t-OP residues were highest in bile, followed by faeces, pyloric caeca, liver and intestine. In these tissues the majority of alkylphenol was in the form of two metabolites which were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy as the glucuronide conjugates of t-OP and t-octylcatechol. t-OP accumulated as the parent compound in fat with a bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 1190, and in brain, muscle, skin, I,one, gills, and eye with BCFs of between 100 and 260. This study suggests that exposure to water-borne alkylphenols results in rapid conjugation and elimination of the chemical via the liver/bile route, but that high amounts of the parent xenoestrogen can accumulate in a variety of other fish tissues.

Concentrations of most OCs in Lake Superior walleye eggs were I to 3 orders of magnitude greater than in Lake Manitoba eggs. Toxaphene (mean concentration (wet weight) +/- I SE, 1580 +/- 462 ng/g) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (240 +/- 24 ng/g) were the predominant OCs in Lake Superior walleye Eggs, whereas DDT and metabolites (eggs 16 +/- 1.5 ng/g, muscle 2.1 +/- 0.36 ng/g) and PCBs (eggs 9.2 +/- 0.83 ng/g, muscle 2.0 +/- 2.4 ng/g) were the most common OCs. in Lake Manitoba walleye eggs and female muscle. Egg size (dry mass) and the concentration of most OCs in Lake Manitoba walleye eggs were positively correlated with female length and age. This relationship was strongest for more hydrophobic OCs (e.g., PCBs) but was not significant for less hydrophobic OCs (e.g., hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs)). Neither egg size nor egg OC concentration of Lake Superior walleye were significantly correlated with female length or age. There was no relationship between OC concentrations in muscle tissue and female length or age of Lake Manitoba walleye. OC concentrations in Lake Manitoba walleye eggs were not correlated with concentrations in the muscle tissue of the mothers, suggesting that OCs in walleye eggs are derived from various tissues. A positive relationship between the egg:muscle ratio of PCB concentrations and the egg:muscle ratio of lipid in freshwater fish suggests that the maternal transfer of PCBs in freshwater fish is related to the relative amounts of lipid in the eggs and mother. The transfer of hydrophobic OCs from mother to eggs in freshwater fish appears to vary within and among fish species and with the hydrophobicity of the OC.","Univ Manitoba, Dept Soil Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Freshwater, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N6, Canada",University of Manitoba; Fisheries & Oceans Canada,"Fisk, AT (corresponding author), Environm Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, 100 Gamelin Blvd, Hull, PQ K1A 0H3, Canada.",afisk@ccs.carleton.ca,"Johnston, Thomas A/G-1809-2012","Johnston, Thomas A/0000-0003-2414-1724",,,,,35,26,32,2,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0380-1330,,,J GREAT LAKES RES,J.

Changes in vitellogenin were measured and these were correlated to changes in gene expression using a 22,000 gene microarray developed specifically for fathead minnows. Significant changes in gene expression were observed in both liver and testis, which correlate to phenotypic changes of vitellogenin induction and reduced competitive behavior. We also compared by real-time PCR the expression changes in key genes related to steroid biosynthesis and metabolism in fish exposed to the effluent as well as in fish exposed to a model estrogen and a model androgen.

Probably to avoid injury to self and offspring, competition among females is often displayed without much physical interaction and therefore remains harder to observe. Here, we show for the first time in a teleost fish, the zebrafish Danio rerio, that females can use waterborne pheromones to suppress reproduction by other females. Female zebrafish that had been exposed to another female's pheromones for 4 days prior to mating spawned significantly fewer viable eggs than females held in isolation or exposed to male pheromones. Male pheromones not only stimulated female reproduction but also increased the quality and viability of eggs. In grouped females, reproductive success correlated with dominance rank. These results indicate that fish pheromones function to control mates and competitors in addition to serving as reproductive timing signals. Differences in female reproductive success observed in many fish species might be explained by this mechanism. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Else-vier Ltd.

There is mounting evidence that EEDs can interfere with the processes of sexual differentiation of brain and behavior in different animal models. We investigated the effects of maternal exposure to EEDs, at concentrations within the range of human exposure and not patently teratogenic, on behavioral responses of male and female house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) before and after puberty. Pregnant dams were trained to spontaneously drink daily doses of corn oil with or without the estrogenic plastic derivative, bisphenol A (BPA, 10 mu g/kg), or the estrogenic insecticide methoxychlor (MXC 20 mu g/kg) from gestation day 11 to postpartum day 8. Their male and female offspring were examined at different ages to examine several components of explorative and emotional behaviors in 3 experimental paradigms: a novelty test before puberty and, as adults, a free-exploratory open-field test and the elevated plus maze test. The main results are sex differences in control mice on a number of behavioral responses at both ages and in all experimental paradigms, while perinatal exposure to BPA or MXC decreased or eliminated such sex differences. The present findings are evidence of long-term consequences of developmental exposure to BPA and MXC on neurobehavioral development and suggest a differential effect of low-dose exposure to these estrogenic chemicals in males and females.

In particular, the apparent widespread feminization of male fish in rivers has received significant attention from regulators in the United Kingdom, the United States, Europe, and Japan. The U.K. and European epidemiological data sets have demonstrated that the occurrence of feminized fish is associated with effluent discharges and that the incidence and severity is positively correlated with the proportion of treated sewage effluent in receiving waters. Although weakly estrogenic substances may contribute to the overall effect, studies have concluded that steroid estrogens are the principal and most potent estrogenic components of domestic sewage. Extensive laboratory data sets confirm that steroid estrogens are capable of eliciting the effects observed in wild fish at concentrations that have been measured in effluents and in the environment. Based on evaluation of the available information, the Environment Agency (England and Wales) has concluded that the weight of evidence for endocrine disruption in fish is sufficient to develop a risk management strategy for estrogenically active effluents that discharge to the aquatic environment.","Environm Agcy, Sci Grp, Wallingford OX10 8BD, Oxon, England",,"Gross-Sorokin, MY (corresponding author), Environm Agcy, Sci Grp, Wallingford OX10 8BD, Oxon, England.",melanie.gross-sorokin@environnient-agency.gov.uk,,,,,,,46,124,150,2,66,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

Intersex is often used as an indicator for disruption of sexual differentiation in fish exposed to different kinds of effluents from human activities. In wild fish it has exclusively been reported in terms of feminisation due to xenoestrogens in the environment. The assumption that the intersex individuals are feminised genetic males can only be proven by genetic sex identification of the intersexual individuals. Intersex and gonadal sex reversal were induced in three-spined sticklebacks by treatment with natural and synthetic steroid hormones. Juvenile sticklebacks were exposed to three nominal concentrations of 17beta-oestradiol (E2); i.e. 0.01, 1.0 and 10.0 mug/L; which were administered to the water either continuously from hatching to the end of the experiment (39-58 days post hatch), during the first 2 weeks after hatching only, from 14 days after hatching onwards, or during the chorionated embryo stage until hatching. Other groups were exposed to 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) at 0.05 mug/L and 17alpha-methyltestosterone (MT) at 1.0 mug/L (nominal concentrations). MT was applied continuously, during the first 2 weeks post hatch only, or from 14 days after hatching onwards. Gonad histology was examined and the genetic sex was identified with male sex-linked PCR markers. Treatment with oestrogens caused feminisation at the two highest E2 concentrations and with EE2. Exposure to E2 before hatching had no effect. Intersexual individuals from oestrogen treatments were genetic males. The genetic sex marker. identified apparent total reversal of the gonad type of genetic males. Treatment with MT did not reveal a clear picture, since intersex was observed in both genetic females and males. MT also caused severe testis abnormalities, mainly the development of large branched cavities with unidentified origin. The process of sex differentiation is most sensitive to the influence of external steroids during the first 2 weeks after hatching. A lower incidence of intersex could also be induced in sticklebacks exposed from 14 days after hatching by E2 treatment, but not with MT. The combination of gonad histopathology with genetic. sex identification in juvenile sticklebacks is suggested as a tool for detecting endocrine disruption in laboratory studies, and might become very useful in field surveys.

Ibuprofen is suspected of influencing sex steroid hormones through steroidogenic pathways in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In this study, the effect of ibuprofen on sex hormone balance and the associated mechanisms was investigated in vitro by use of H295R cells. We also conducted chronic toxicity tests using freshwater fish, Oryzias latipes, and two freshwater cladocerans. Daphnia magna and Moina macrocopa, for up to 144 and 21 d of exposure, respectively. Ibuprofen exposure increased 17 beta-estradiol (E2) production and aromatase activity in H295R cells. Testosterone (T) production decreased in a dose-dependent manner. For D. magna, the 48 h immobilization EC50 was 51.4 mg/L and the 21 d reproduction NOEC was <1.23 mg/L; for M. macrocopa, the 48 h immobilization EC50 was 72.6 mg/L and the 7 d reproduction NOEC was 25 mg/L For O.latipes, 120 d survival NOEC was 0.0001 mg/L In addition, ibuprofen affected several endpoints related to reproduction of the fish, including induction of vitellogenin in male fish, fewer broods per pair, and more eggs per brood. Parental exposure to as low as 0.0001 mg/L ibuprofen delayed hatching of eggs even when they were transferred to and cultured in clean water. Delayed hatching is environmentally relevant because this may increase the risk of being predated. For O. latipes, the acute-to-chronic ratio of ibuprofen was estimated to be greater than 1000. Overall, relatively high acute-to-chronic ratio and observation of reproduction damage in medaka fish at environmentally relevant ranges of ibuprofen warrant the need for further studies to elucidate potential ecological consequences of ibuprofen contamination in the aquatic environment.

In our study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to the 5 ng/L, 1 mu g/L and 50 mu g/L of DE-71 for the duration of the whole life cycle (120 days, from eggs to adults). The expression of selected genes along the brain-pituitary-gonadal (BPG) axis and liver, and the levels of plasma sex hormones were examined. In male fish, up-regulation of GnRH in brain, FSH beta and LH beta in pituitary, FSH-receptor, LH-receptor, and CYP19a in testis was clearly evident, while down-regulation of CYP11a and 3 beta-HSD was found in testis. In female fish, a 2.4-fold up-regulation of 3 beta-HSD was found in ovary upon exposure to 50 mu g/L of DE-71. GnRH in brain, FSH beta and LH beta in pituitary were also up-regulated, while ER beta, TH and TPH in brain and GnRH-receptor in pituitary were significantly down-regulated. Hepatic ER alpha, AR and VTG in males were all down-regulated, while hepatic ER alpha and AR in female were up-regulated. Serum estradiol (E-2) was reduced in both male and female upon exposure to DE-71, while significant increases in serum testosterone (T) and 11-keto-testosterone (11-KT) were only found in male but not female fish. The ratio of T/E-2 as well as the ratio of 11-KT/E-2 in male fish increased in a dose-dependent manner upon exposure to DE-71. Our overall results showed that whole life exposure of DE-71 altered the expression of regulatory genes and receptors at all three levels of the BPG axis in zebrafish, and the responses are sex dependent. The observed disruption of GnRH and GtHs can be further related to the subsequent disruption in both levels and balance sex steroid hormones. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Han, X.

The dominant's ability to reproductively control subordinates may depend on differences in competitive ability, due to, e.g. body size differences, but may also depend on the number of same-sex competitors inside the group. We tested experimentally whether subordinates reproduce more when these subordinates are large or when a second subordinate of the same sex need to be controlled by the dominants, using the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. Dominant pairs were assisted by a large and a small unrelated subordinate; sexes of these fish were varied in a full-factorial design (giving four treatments). Dominant males lost significantly more parentage to the large subordinate male when a small subordinate male was also present, compared to when a small subordinate female was present. However, subordinate paternity was generally low and did not significantly curb total dominant male reproductive output, which was more affected by the sizes and numbers of reproductive females present inside his group. Dominant female maternity, clutch sizes and total output did not depend on the treatments. Subordinate-subordinate reproduction was virtually absent (one out of 874 offspring). Female subordinates were more likely to provide care for their own broods. In contrast, male subordinates did not adjust their level of care to their parentage. Variability in female subordinate alloparental brood care was particularly high, with females showing more care than males in general. We also detected effects of growth rate and food ration on parentage independent of the treatments, most notably: (i) a trade-off between dominant male growth rate and paternity; (ii) a decrease in dominant male paternity with increasing food ration; (iii) a positive effect of growth rate on paternity in small males. We conclude that dominant males should be sensitive to the number and sizes of subordinate males present in their group, particularly when these subordinates are not helpful or grow fast, and food is plentiful. Dominant females should be less sensitive, because female subordinates do not appear to impose reproductive costs and can be helpful through alloparental brood care.","[Heg, Dik; Jutzeler, Eva; Bonfils, Danielle; Mitchell, Jeremy S.] Univ Bern, Dept Behav Ecol, CH-3032 Hinterkappelen, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Heg, D (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Dept Behav Ecol, Wohlenstr 50A, CH-3032 Hinterkappelen, Switzerland.",dik.heg@esh.unibe.ch,,"Heg, Dik/0000-0002-8766-7945",NSERC; SNF [3100A0-108473],NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); SNF,We thank R.

However, UK WwTWs effluents also contain compounds with androgen receptor activities which may contribute to reproductive dysfunction in fish. A toxicity identification and evaluation (TIE) approach was used to profile (anti)androgenic compounds in bile of fish exposed to two WwTWs effluents. Extracts of bile from exposed fish and effluent were fractionated by liquid chromatography and tested for (anti)androgenic activity using a yeast androgen receptor transcription screen (YAS). A number of bile fractions contained (anti)androgenic activity unique to the effluent-exposed fish. Some of these fractions contained di(chloromethyl)anthracene or dichlorophene, and these contaminants showed antagonistic activity in the YAS when tested as pure compounds. No androgenic activity was detected in the effluents, but TIE analysis of bile revealed a number of androgenic fractions which contained testosterone metabolites that were unique to effluent-exposed fish. This is the first work reported on the nature of some of the (anti)androgenic compounds that bioaccumulate in fish from WwTWs effluents and indicates that other contaminants, besides estrogenic substances, need to be considered for their potential to contribute to the disruption of reproductive system of fish in UK waters.","[Hill, Elizabeth M.; Evans, Kerry L.; Horwood, Julia; Rostkowski, Pawel; Oladapo, Francis Olumide; Gibson, Richard] Univ Sussex, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Sch Life Sci, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England; [Shears, Janice A.; Tyler, Charles R.] Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England",University of Sussex; University of Exeter,"Hill, EM (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Sch Life Sci, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England.",E.M.Hill@sussex.ac.uk,"Rostkowski, Pawel/H-8208-2019","Rostkowski, Pawel/0000-0001-9778-4283","EU [162/039/096]; NERC [NE/E017363/1, NE/E016634/1]; NERC [NE/E016634/1, NE/E017363/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/E017363/1, NE/E016634/1] Funding Source: researchfish",EU(European Union (EU)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"E.M.H. and K.L.E. are joint first authors of this article.

We therefore designed a combined laboratory-field experiment to detect how social status and aggression relate to growth rate, movement and habitat choice in a natural stream. In 1998 and 1999, juvenile brown trout were caught in the wild and paired in staged dyadic contests in the laboratory where relative dominance rank was determined. Three categories of fish could be distinguished: dominants, subordinates and non-aggressive individuals of indeterminate status. All tested fish were released back into the stream and recaptured after 3 and 8 weeks. Dominant fish grew faster than subordinates, but non-aggressive fish grew as fast as dominants. Social status had no significant effect on recapture rates. Movement was not significantly related to status, but smaller individuals were more mobile and preferred faster-flowing habitats closer to the shore than larger fish. The utilisation of pool and riffle habitats varied among status categories, but this relationship was not consistent between years. These results support the hypothesis that dominance increases fitness in the wild. However, our findings also indicate that less aggressive individuals can be successful in heterogeneous natural habitats. Thus, studies performed under laboratory conditions may overestimate the fitness advantage of aggressive behaviour.","Univ Gothenburg, Dept Zool, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,,johan.hojesjo@zool.gu.se,,,,,,,53,60,67,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Endocrine disruption can be profound because of the crucial role hormones play in controlling development. Since that time, there have been numerous documented examples of adverse effects of EDCs in invertebrates, fish, wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. Hormonal systems can be disrupted by numerous different anthropogenic chemicals including antiandrogens, androgens, estrogens, AhR agonists, inhibitors of steroid hormone synthesis, antithyroid substances, and retinoid agonists. In addition, pathways and targets for endocrine disruption extend beyond the traditional estrogen/androgen/thyroid receptor-mediated reproductive and developmental systems. For example, scientists have expressed concern about the potential role of EDCs in increasing trends in early puberty in girls, obesity and type II diabetes in the United States and other populations. New concerns include complex endocrine alterations induced by mixtures of chemicals, an issue broadened due to the growing awareness that EDCs present in the environment include a variety of potent human and veterinary pharmaceutical products, personal care products, nutraceuticals and phytosterols. In this review we (1) address what have we learned about the effects of EDCs on fish, wildlife, and human health, (2) discuss representative animal studies on (anti)androgens, estrogens and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-like chemicals, and (3) evaluate regulatory proposals being considered for screening and testing these chemicals.","[Hotchkiss, Andrew K.; Rider, Cynthia V.; Blystone, Chad R.; Wilson, Vickie S.; Hartig, Phillip C.; Gray, L.

However, there are no reported field studies on the trophodynamics of 4-NP and its precursor, nonylphenol polyethoxylate (NPEOs) surfactants, in aquatic food webs. This study reports the trophodynamics of 4-NP and NPEOs (4 < s < 16) in a marine aquatic food web from Bohai Bay, North China. 4-NP and NPEOs (4 < s < 16) were determined in 14 marine species including plankton, benthic invertebrates, fish, and marine birds. This paper provides the first report on the occurrence of NPEOs with s > 5 in marine biota. Co-analysis of DOTS in all samples allowed a direct comparison of the bioaccumulation behavior of DDTs with that of NP and NPEOs. The lipid equivalent concentration of DOE and 2,2bis(chlorophenyl)-1-chloroethylene (DDMU) increased with increasing trophic level, and the trophic level was determined by stable isotope ratios. The trophic magnification factors (TMFs) of DDE and DDMU were 3.26 and 3.7, respectively. Lipid equivalent concentrations of 4-NP and of all NPEOs did not exhibit a statistically significant correlation with trophic levels in the food web, and the TMF of NP was 0.83, which was similar to those of all NPEOs (0.45-1.22). These results show that in the studied aquatic food web, there was no trophic magnification for 4-NP and NPEOs, whereas DOE and DOW biomagnified.","Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Sci, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, State Key Lab Environm Aquat Chem, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China",Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES),"Hu, JY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",hujy@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Wan, Yi/N-7643-2013; jiang, min/D-2531-2009; Hu, Jianying/F-2096-2014; Yang, Min/B-9038-2019","Wan, Yi/0000-0003-1312-6254; Tao, Shu/0000-0002-7374-7063; Yang, Min/0000-0002-9034-3175",,,,,42,84,89,6,112,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

In field studies, biomarkers of exposure [e.g., vitellogenin (VTG) induction in male fish] are powerful tools for tracking single substances and mixtures of concern. Biomarkers also provide linkage between field and laboratory data, thereby playing an important role in directing the need for and design of fish chronic tests for EDCs. It is the adverse effect end points (e.g., altered development, growth, and/or reproduction) from such tests that are most valuable for calculating (NOEC)-N-adverse (no observed effect oncentration) or (EC10)-E-adverse (effective concentration for a 10% response) and subsequently deriving predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs). With current uncertainties, (NOEC)-N-biomarker or (EC10)-E-biomarker data should not be used in isolation to derive PNECs. In the future, however, there may be scope to increasingly use biomarker data in environmental decision making, if plausible linkages am be made across levels of organization such that adverse outcomes might be envisaged relative to biomarker responses. For biomarkers to fulfil their potential, they should be mechanistically relevant and reproducible (as measured by interlaboratory comparisons of the same protocol). VTG is a good example of such a biomarker in that it provides an insight to the mode of action (estrogenicity) that is vital to fish reproductive health. Interlaboratory reproducibility data for VTG are also encouraging; recent comparisons (using the same immunoassay protocol) have provided coefficients of variation (CVs) of 38-55% (comparable to published CVs of 19-58% for fish survival and growth end points used in regulatory test guidelines). While concern over environmental xenoestrogens has led to the evaluation of reproductive biomarkers in fish, it must be remembered that many substances act via diverse mechanisms of action such that the environmental risk assessment for EDCs is a broad and complex issue. Also, biomarkers such as secondary sexual characteristics, gonadosomatic indices, plasma steroids, and gonadal histology have significant potential for guiding interspecies assessments of EDCs and designing fish chronic tests. To strengthen the utility of EDC biomarkers in fish, we need to establish a historical control database (also considering natural variability) to help differentiate between statistically detectable versus biologically significant responses. In conclusion, as research continues to develop a range of useful EDC biomarkers, environmental decision-making needs to move forward, and it is proposed that the biomarkers as signposts approach is a pragmatic way forward in the current risk assessment of EDCs.","AstraZeneca Global Safety Hlth & Environm, Brixham Environm Lab, Brixham TQ5 8BA, Devon, England; US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Off Res & Dev, Duluth, MN USA; Univ Bern, Ctr Fish Wildlife Hlth, Bern, Switzerland; Univ Exeter, Sch Biol Sci, Exeter, Devon, England",AstraZeneca; United States Environmental Protection Agency; University of Bern; University of Exeter,"Hutchinson, TH (corresponding author), AstraZeneca Global Safety Hlth & Environm, Brixham Environm Lab, Brixham TQ5 8BA, Devon, England.",tom.hutchinson@astrazeneca.com,"Segner, Helmut/D-5714-2014","Hutchinson, Tom/0000-0001-8823-5442","Natural Environment Research Council [NE/C50767X/1, NE/C507710/1, NER/T/S/2002/00182, NE/C507702/1, NE/C507688/1, NE/C507661/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,126,248,281,6,82,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

The objective of this study was to use the assay to characterize responses of fathead minnow reproductive endocrinology and physiology to the mammalian antiandrogen, flutamide. Male and female fish were exposed to nominal (target) concentrations of 50 and 500 mug flutamide/l for 21-days, following which plasma steroid and vitellogenin concentrations were determined and gonadal morphology assessed. Fecundity of the fish was significantly reduced by exposure to a measured test concentration of 651 mug flutamide/l. In addition, embryo hatch was significantly reduced at this concentration. Qualitative histological assessment of ovaries from females exposed to flutamide indicated a decrease in mature oocytes and an increase in atretic follicles. Testes of males exposed to flutamide exhibited spermatocyte degeneration and necrosis. Concentration-dependent increases in plasma testosterone and vitellogenin concentrations were observed in the females. Flutamide also altered reproductive endocrinology of male fathead minnows. Males exposed to 651 mug flutamide/l exhibited elevated concentrations of beta-estradiol and vitellogenin. In summary, the results of this study with the fathead minnow demonstrate that flutamide affects reproductive endocrine function in fish and that the type of hormonal pattern and histopathology effects observed are consistent with an antiandrogenic mode-of-action. Consequently, our findings suggest that the 21-day reproduction assay utilizing fathead minnows is a sensitive short-term screening method for the detection of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, including antiandrogens.

Intersex fish were also found to have an altered endocrine status and an elevated concentration of plasma vitellogenin. Gonadal growth was inhibited only in severely intersex fish, whereas progression of spermatogenesis was delayed in a large proportion of all intersex and exposed male fish. In contrast to the effects observed in the intersex and exposed male fish, the maturation of ovaries in female fish inhabiting effluent-contaminated rivers appeared to be less obviously affected, although a higher incidence of oocyte atresia was found in the effluent-exposed fish compared with the reference fish. A positive correlation was found between the proportion of female tissue in the gonads of intersex fish and their plasma vitellogenin concentration, suggesting that vitellogenin can be an indicator for the level of gonadal disruption in intersex roach. The estradiol-17beta concentration in intersex fish was intermediate between the concentration found in males and females, and the plasma testosterone was between 2- and 3-fold higher in intersex fish compared with male fish. These data suggest a link between altered endocrine status in intersex and female fish and gonadal disruption. Spermiation was also affected in roach living in effluent-impacted rivers: a lower proportion of fish were found releasing sperm, and in those intersex fish that were spermiating, a reduced milt volume and a reduced sperm density were found. All intersex fish had malformations of the reproductive duct(s), and in severely affected fish, the ducts were occluded, thus preventing release of gametes. in view of the widespread occurrence of intersexuality in wild fish populations in rivers throughout the United Kingdom, assessment of the reproductive capabilities of these intersex roach is clearly needed to understand the impact of this phenomenon on roach fertility.","Brunel Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; Trentside Off, Nottingham NG2 5FA, England; Dept Environm Transport & Reg, Chem & Biotechnol Div, London SW1 6DE, England; Natl Ctr Ecotoxicol & Hazardous Subst, Environm Agcy, Wallingford OX10 8BD, Oxon, England; Univ Exeter, Sch Biol Sci, Hatherly Labs, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England",Brunel University; University of Exeter,"Jobling, S (corresponding author), Brunel Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",susan.jobling@brunel.ac.uk,"sumpter, john/HGB-7584-2022; jobling, susan/N-9316-2016","jobling, susan/0000-0002-9322-9597",,,,,42,356,412,2,93,SOC STUDY REPRODUCTION,MADISON,"1691 MONROE ST,SUITE # 3, MADISON, WI 53711-2021 USA",0006-3363,1529-7268,,BIOL REPROD,Biol.

These reproductive disturbances are consistent with exposure to hormonally active substances and a re associated with discharges from sewage treatment works that are known to contain estrogenic chemicals.

Some of these chemicals are widespread aquatic pollutants, and bioconcentrate in aquatic biota. Exposure of male rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to four different alkylphenolic chemicals caused synthesis of vitellogenin, a process normally dependent on endogenous estrogens, and a concomitant inhibition of testicular growth. The magnitude of these estrogenic effects was dependent on the estrogenic potency of the chemical, the stage of reproductive development of the fish, and the concentration of the chemical in the water.

This concern stems from the view that the effects observed have a parallel in humans, and that both phenomena are caused by exposure to mixtures of contaminants that interfere with reproductive development. The evidence for a wildlife-human connection is, however, weak: Testicular dysgenesis syndrome, seen in human males, is most easily reproduced in rodent models by exposure to mixtures of antiandrogenic chemicals. In contrast, the accepted explanation for feminization of wild male fish is that it results mainly from exposure to steroidal estrogens originating primarily from human excretion. OBJECTIVES: We sought to further explore the hypothesis that endocrine disruption in fish is multi-causal, resulting from exposure to mixtures of chemicals with both estrogenic and antiandrogenic properties. METHODS: We used hierarchical generalized linear and generalized additive statistical modeling to explore the associations between modeled concentrations and activities of estrogenic and antiandrogenic chemicals in 30 U.K. rivers and feminized responses seen in wild fish living in these rivers. RESULTS: In addition to the estrogenic substances, antiandrogenic activity was prevalent in almost all treated sewage effluents tested. Further, the results of the modeling demonstrated that feminizing effects in wild fish could be best modeled as a function of their predicted exposure to both anti-androgens and estrogens or to antiandrogens alone. CONCLUSION: The results provide a strong argument for a multicausal etiology of widespread feminization of wild fish in U.K. rivers involving contributions from both steroidal estrogens and xeno-estrogens and from other (as yet unknown) contaminants with antiandrogenic properties. These results may add farther credence to the hypothesis that endocrine-disrupting effects seen in wild fish and in humans are caused by similar combinations of endocrine-disrupting chemical cocktails.","[Jobling, Susan] Brunel Univ, Inst Environm, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Jobling, Susan] Basics Ltd, Burham, Bucks, England; [Burn, Robert.

Given the extent of this problem, risk assessment models are needed to predict the location and severity of endocrine disruption in river catchments and to identify areas where regulation of sewage discharges to remove these contaminants is necessary. In this study we attempted to correlate the extent of endocrine disruption in roach in British rivers, with their predicted exposure to steroid estrogens derived from the human population. The predictions of steroid estrogen exposure at each river site were determined by combining the modeled concentrations of the individual steroid estrogens [17 beta-estradiol (E-2), estrone (E-1), and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2)] in each sewage effluent with their predicted dilution in the immediate receiving water. This model was applied to 45 sites on 39 rivers throughout the United Kingdom. Each site studied was then categorized as either high, medium, or low risk on the basis of the assumed additive potency of the three steroid estrogens calculated from data derived from published studies in various cyprinid fish species. We sampled 1,438 wild roach from the predicted high-, medium-, and low-risk river sites and examined them for evidence and severity of endocrine disruption. Both the incidence and the severity of intersex in wild roach were significantly correlated with the predicted concentrations of the natural estrogens (E-1 and E-2) and the synthetic contraceptive pill estrogen (EE2) present. Predicted steroid estrogen exposure was, however, less well correlated with the plasma vitellogenin concentration measured in the same fish. Moreover, we found no correlation between any of the end points measured in the roach and the proportion of industrial effluents entering the rivers we studied. Overall, our results provide further and substantive evidence to support the hypothesis that steroidal estrogens play a major role in causing intersex in wild freshwater fish in rivers in the United Kingdom and clearly show that the location and severity of these endocrine-disrupting effects can be predicted.","Brunel Univ, Inst Environm, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; Beyond Basics Ltd, Burnham, Bucks, England; Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford, Oxon, England; Environm Agcy, Natl Fisheries Tech Team, Warrington, Cheshire, England; Environm Agcy, Natl Fish Hlth Lab, Brampton, Cambs, England; Univ Exeter, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, Hatherly Labs, Environm & Mol Fish Biol Grp, Exeter, Devon, England",Brunel University; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); University of Exeter,"Jobling, S (corresponding author), Brunel Univ, Inst Environm, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",jobling@beyondthebasic.co.uk,"van Aerle, Ronny/C-5148-2009; jobling, susan/N-9316-2016; Rose, Rebecca J/B-7812-2011; Johnson, Andrew/C-5551-2008; Williams, Richard/E-4855-2012","jobling, susan/0000-0002-9322-9597; Santos, Eduarda/0000-0002-4074-0121; Johnson, Andrew/0000-0003-1570-3764; Williams, Richard/0000-0002-9876-0491; van Aerle, Ronny/0000-0002-2605-6518","Natural Environment Research Council [ceh010022, ceh010010, NE/C002369/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,62,423,476,3,206,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

A search of Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts and other sources showed that only 0.1% of 19,199 studies of aquatic pollution and fishes during the past 20 years have made this link. Effects on parental care and courtship have been investigated using a variety of pollutants (e.g. acidification, herbicide, thermal effluent) in several fish families (e.g. Cichlidae, Poeciliidae, Gasterosteidae, Cyprinidae). Eleven of the 19 studies found a change in behaviour from the norm. Effects on courtship included decreases or increases in frequency of displays, increased courtship duration, or performance of male-like behaviour by masculinized females. Studies of parental care have found decreased nest-building activity, decreased offspring defence, or changes in division of parental care between the sexes. Few studies have measured reproductive success or extrapolated their results to effects on populations. We develop a framework for exploring links between pollution and behavioural ecology which suggests potential impacts on life history trade-offs in reproduction, genetic changes in populations, and population sizes. Many reproductive behaviours of fish species are readily quantifiable and behaviours such as courtship by male guppies and other members of the Poeciliidae show some promise for pollution monitoring and behavioural toxicity tests. Choice of such assays would have to compete with the sensitivity and practicality of more traditional methods but may serve as useful complements. There is considerable scope for further research into conservation. A synthesis between behavioural ecology and toxicology should thus provide useful insights for both fields.","UNIV E ANGLIA, SCH BIOL SCI, NORWICH NR4 7TJ, NORFOLK, ENGLAND",University of East Anglia,,,"Reynolds, John D/L-6345-2015",,,,,,82,82,95,1,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3166,1573-5184,,REV FISH BIOL FISHER,Rev.

Feminized responses were induced in male roach exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of the pharmaceutical estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, EE2 (up to 4 ng/L), during early life (from fertilization to 84 days post-hatch, dph), and these effects were signaled by altered patterns of expression of two cloned roach estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes, ER alpha and ER beta, in the brain and gonad/liver. Transactivation assays were developed for both roach ER subtypes and the estrogenic potencies of steroidal estrogens differed markedly at the different ER subtypes. EE2 was by far the most potent chemical, and estrone (E-1, the most prevalent environmental steroid in wastewater discharges) was equipotent with estradiol (E-2) in activating the ERs. Comparison of the EC50 values for the compounds tested showed that ER beta was 3-21-fold more sensitive to natural steroidal estrogens and 54-fold more sensitive to EE2 as compared to ER alpha. These findings add substantial support to the hypothesis that steroidal estrogens play a significant role in the induction of intersex in roach populations in U.K. rivers and that the molecular approach described could be usefully applied to understand interspecies sensitivity to xenoestrogens.","Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; Brunel Univ, Dept Sci Biol, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; Natl Inst Nat Sci, Okazaki Inst Integrat Biosci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448787, Japan",University of Exeter; Brunel University; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; Okazaki Institute for Integrative Bioscience (OIIB),"Tyler, CR (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Prince Wales Rd, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",C.R.Tyler@exeter.ac.uk,"Iguchi, Taisen/AAL-4225-2021; jobling, susan/N-9316-2016; Katsu, Yoshinao/F-9122-2012; Lange, Anke/F-9643-2010","jobling, susan/0000-0002-9322-9597; Lange, Anke/0000-0003-0665-8404",,,,,44,51,61,2,43,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

Male fishes downstream of some wastewater out falls produce vitellogenin (VTG) (a protein normally synthesized by females during oocyte maturation) and early-stage eggs in their testes, and this feminization has been attributed to the presence of estrogenic substances such as natural estrogens [estrone or 17 beta-estradiol (E2)], the synthetic estrogen used in birth-control pills [17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2)], or weaker estrogen mimics such as nonylphenol in the water. Despite widespread evidence that male fishes are being feminized, it is not known whether these low-level, chronic exposures adversely impact the sustainability of wild populations. We conducted a 7-year, wholelake experiment at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in northwestern Ontario, Canada, and showed that chronic exposure of fathead minnow (Pimephalespromelas) to low concentrations (5-6 ng-L-1) of the potent 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol led to feminization of males through the production of vitellogenin mRNA and protein, impacts on gonadal development as evidenced by intersex in males and altered oogenesis in females, and, ultimately, a near extinction of this species from the lake. Our observations demonstrate that the concentrations of estrogens and their mimics observed in freshwaters can impact the sustainability of wild fish populations.","Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Freshwater, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N6, Canada; US EPA, Mol Indicators Res Branch, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA",Fisheries & Oceans Canada; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Kidd, KA (corresponding author), Univ New Brunswick, Canadian Rivers Inst, St John, NB E2E 4P1, Canada.",kiddk@unbsj.ca,"Kidd, Karen/ABG-3237-2020; Palace, Vince/AHB-6708-2022; Mills, Kingston/F-5684-2013; Lazorchak, James/E-2363-2016","Kidd, Karen/0000-0002-5619-1358; Mills, Kingston/0000-0003-3646-8222; Lazorchak, James/0000-0002-7354-7571; Blanchfield, Paul/0000-0003-0886-5642",,,,,30,1477,1745,22,1129,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Waterborne exposures of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) to equol from soon after hatch to approximately 100 days posthatch induced gonadal intersex (i.e., testis-ova) in males at incidences of 10 and 87% in equol treatments of 0.4 and 0.8 mug/L, respectively. Exposure to the highest test concentration of genistein, 1,000 mug/L, also caused a low incidence (i.e., 12%) of gonadal intersex in male medaka. The ovaries of female medaka from both equol and genistein treatments showed delayed oocyte maturation, atretic oocytes, an enlarged ovarian lumen, proliferation of somatic stromal tissue, and primordial germ cells; responses were concentration dependent. Alterations to externally visible secondary sex characteristics occurred in medaka exposed to both equol and genistein. In treatments with 1,000 mug/L genistein, 72% of male medaka (as identified by the gonadal phenotype) showed feminized secondary sex characteristics. Gonadal intersex and alterations to secondary sex characteristics have been noted in several fish populations around the world. This laboratory study indicates that isoflavone compounds should be considered candidate estrogenic compounds that may be involved in the alteration of sexual development in feral fish populations.","Trent Univ, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada",Trent University,"Kiparissis, Y (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Sch Environm Studies, Biosci Complex 3230, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",kiparisy@biology.queensu.ca,,,,,,,62,111,129,3,31,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

Several studies have indicated potential changes in hormone levels as well as declines in vertebrates with increasing dietary MeHg exposure. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to identify alterations in gene expression associated with MeHg exposure, specifically those associated with previously observed changes in reproduction and reproductive biomarkers. Fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas were fed one of three diets that were similar to documented concentrations of MeHg in the diets of wild invertivorous and piscivorous fish. We used a commercial macroarray in conjunction with quantitative polymerase chain reaction to examine gene expression in fish in relation to exposure to these environmentally relevant doses of MeHg. RESULTS: Expression of genes commonly associated with endocrine disruption was altered with Hg exposure. Specifically, we observed a marked up-regulation in vitellogenin mRNA in individual Hg exposed males and a significant decline in vitellogenin gene expression in female fish with increasing Fig concentrations. Other genes identified by the macroarray experiment included those associated with egg fertilization and development, sugar metabolism, apoptosis, and electron transport. We also observed differences in expression patterns between male and female fish not related to genes specifically associated with reproduction, indicating a potential physiological difference in the reaction of males and females to MeHg. CONCLUSION: Gene expression data may provide insight into the mechanisms by which MeHg affects reproduction in fish and indicate how MeHg differs in its effect from other heavy metals and endocrine-disrupting compounds.","Univ Wisconsin, Great Lakes WATER Inst, Milwaukee, WI 53204 USA; Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Marine & Freshwater Biomed Sci Ctr, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; Univ Wisconsin, River Studies Ctr, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; University System of Ohio; Miami University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin System,"Klaper, R (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Great Lakes WATER Inst, 600 E Greenfield Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53204 USA.",rklaper@uwm.edu,,"Drevnick, Paul/0000-0003-2843-9720; Carvan, Michael/0000-0002-9190-9417; Klaper, Rebecca/0000-0002-9239-6916","NIEHS NIH HHS [ES04184, P30 ES004184] Funding Source: Medline",NIEHS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)),,,52,62,80,2,36,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

Here, we have used paternity analysis to provide new information on the ability of an endocrine disruptor to deleteriously affect male guppy reproductive fitness by including the effect of intermale competition. Groups of male guppies were exposed to 10.5, 44.4, or 112 ng/L of the synthetic estrogen 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) from birth to adulthood. Subsequently, an exposed male competed against an unexposed male for the opportunity to fertilize a receptive female. The successful males siring the majority of the offspring in each brood were then identified using micro-satellites in genetic paternity analysis. Only the highest dose of EE2 produced harmful effects with a significantly female-biased sex ratio, significant reductions in male sperm count, testis weight, body coloration and courtship behavior, and a significant increase in body size. These feminizing effects were translated into a highly significant reduction in fertility, where only 1 of the 17 exposed males sired offspring in competition with unexposed males. The evidence suggests that EE2-treated males have reduced reproductive fitness compared with untreated males, possibly the result of EE2 effects on multiple fitness traits. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing evidence of endocrine disruption at the population level that has included the ecologically highly relevant effect of sexual competition on male reproductive fitness.","Univ Aarhus, Inst Biol Sci, Dept Zoophysiol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Bayley, M (corresponding author), Univ Aarhus, Inst Biol Sci, Dept Zoophysiol, Bldg 135, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",Mark.Bayley@biology.au.dk,"Baatrup, Erik/B-5371-2010; Bayley, Mark/J-5947-2013","Baatrup, Erik/0000-0002-5948-4519; Bayley, Mark/0000-0001-8052-2551",,,,,42,68,79,0,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0006-3363,1529-7268,,BIOL REPROD,Biol.

The fish rapidly accumulated DDTs from both routes of exposure, particularly the gills and viscera. Elimination of DDTs following aqueous or dietary uptake was slow, and biotranslocation of DDTs was significant during the exposure period but negligible during the depuration period. The biotransformation process was more significant following dietary exposure. During depuration, DDE was the major biotransformed product in the sea breams' carcasses while DDD was the major product in the gills and viscera. However, DDD had a significantly higher elimination rate than DDE and, subsequently, the fish retained more DDE in the body. Intraspecies variability in the elimination and biotransformation processes in fish was observed. We demonstrated that the route of exposure significantly affected the fate and biokinetics of DDTs in fish. The application of a dynamic model provided a tool for quantifying the elimination and biotransformation of DDT in fish. The present study provided insights into the bioaccumulation and biotransformation pathways of DDT in fish that could have important ecotoxicological implications.","[Kwong, Raymond W.

The effects of early exposure to estrogens or estrogenic compounds can be evaluated by neurobehavioral testing after puberty. In this study, the effect of developmental exposure to the chlorinated pesticide, chlordecone (CD) on sexually differentiated behaviors in adults was investigated because CD binds to estrogen receptors and causes estrogenic effects in the reproductive tract of humans and rodents at relatively high doses. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 5 mg/kg CD by intraperitoneal injection on gestation day 16 (GD 16). Offspring were gonadectomized on postnatal day 50 (PN 50) to remove the effects of circulating hormones and were sequentially tested for sex-typic spontaneous behaviors in an open field and elevated plus maze, and for male and female mating behavior following the appropriate steroid regimen. Female rats exposed in utero to CD showed an increased ratio of inner to total crossings in the open field and significantly increased lordosis and male mounting as compared to female control rats. Male rats exposed in utero to CD showed significantly increased lordosis as compared to male control rats and no change in male mating behaviors. Permanent changes in adult behavior were consistent with both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic actions following developmental exposure to CD at the dose tested. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The causation of the ovotestis condition in wild roach, however, has yet to be established. Furthermore, the impact of long-term exposure to WwTW effluents on the reproductive fitness of wild fish populations is not known, and this information is crucial for population level effect assessments. We undertook a chronic exposure of roach to a treated estrogenic wastewater effluent for up to 3.5 years to assess principally for effects on subsequent reproductive fitness, as determined through parentage analysis on offspring from a competitive breeding study. In generating the fish for the breeding study we found that exposure to full strength WwTW effluent until sexual maturity resulted in sex reversal in almost all males in the population; 98% of the exposed fish were phenotypic females, containing ovaries. Furthermore, fish exposed to a 50% dilution of WwTW effluent contained ovotestis (21% of the male roach) that was absent from the control population. In competitive breeding studies, and applying DNA microsatellites to assess parentage, we show that presumptive females exposed to sexual maturity to WwTW effluent bred normally, albeit in the absence of nonexposed females, but putative sex-reversed males breeding as females contributed poorly, if at all, in a breeding population, depending on the competition. These novel findings on sex reversal add a new dimension for impact assessments of exposure to WwTW effluents on fish populations.","[Lange, Anke; Paull, Gregory C.; Hamilton, Patrick B.; Tyler, Charles R.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; [Iguchi, Taisen] Natl Inst Nat Sci, Natl Inst Basic Biol, Okazaki Inst Integrat Biosci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448787, Japan; [Iguchi, Taisen] Grad Univ Adv Studies, Sch Life Sci, Dept Basic Biol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448787, Japan",University of Exeter; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB); Okazaki Institute for Integrative Bioscience (OIIB); Graduate University for Advanced Studies - Japan,"Lange, A (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",A.Lange@exeter.ac.uk; C.R.Tyler@exeter.ac.uk,"Iguchi, Taisen/AAL-4225-2021; Lange, Anke/F-9643-2010","Lange, Anke/0000-0003-0665-8404","UK Natural Environmental Research Council [NE/D002818/1, NER/T/S/2002/00182]; DEFRA; UK Environment Agency; Ministry of the Environment, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23254003] Funding Source: KAKEN; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G019355/1, NE/D002818/1, NE/E016634/1, NE/E017363/1, NER/T/S/2002/00182, NE/G02037X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/E016634/1, NE/E017363/1, NE/G02037X/1, NE/G019355/1, NE/D002818/1] Funding Source: UKRI","UK Natural Environmental Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); DEFRA(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); UK Environment Agency; Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","We thank the following for their support of this work: members of the Environmental and Molecular Fish Biology group at the University of Exeter, Alan Henshaw and his team at Calverton Fish Farm (UK Environment Agency), and Afsaneh Janbakhsh and David Walker at Essex and Suffolk Water.

In U.K. rivers, feminization responses, including intersex, are widespread in wild roach (Rutilus rutilus) populations, and severely affected fish have a reduced reproductive success. We exposed roach to environmentally relevant concentrations of the contraceptive estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) for up to 2 years, including intermittent and repeated exposures,to determine effects on sexual development and subsequent responsiveness to estrogen. Exposure of roach to EE2 (at 4 ng/L) for 2 years resulted in sex reversal in males, leading to an all-female population with two cohorts in terms of their stages of ovarian development, one paralleling the control females and one at a significantly less advanced stage, which we propose were sex-reversed males. Differing developmental and maturing rates of the putative sex-reversed males compared with control females would question their functional capability as females in the wild. Early-life exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2 sensitized females to estrogen, as determined by the measurement of the responses of estrogen-sensitive genes in a further EE2 challenge 398 days after the original exposure. In the wild, exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2 during early life has significantly wider implications for the sexual physiology in fish than has thus far been determined.","[Lange, Anke; Paull, Gregory C.; Coe, Tobias S.; Tyler, Charles R.] Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; [Katsu, Yoshinao; Urushitani, Hiroshi; Iguchi, Taisen] Natl Inst Nat Sci, Okazaki Inst Integrat Biosci, Natl Inst Basic Biol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448787, Japan",University of Exeter; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB); Okazaki Institute for Integrative Bioscience (OIIB),"Lange, A (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",A.Lange@exeter.ac.uk,"Iguchi, Taisen/AAL-4225-2021; Katsu, Yoshinao/F-9122-2012; Lange, Anke/F-9643-2010","Lange, Anke/0000-0003-0665-8404","U.K. Natural Environmental Research Council [NE/D002818/1, NER/T/S/2002/00182]; U.K. Environment Agency (C.R.T.); the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (T.I.); (Y.K.).

Exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2 during the critical period of sex differentiation resulted in gonadal feminization and all roach exposed to 4 ng EE2/l were females. These effects on gonadal development were associated with alterations in the expression of both esr and cyp19a1 genes in bodies and heads of exposed fish with the most marked effects on the expression of esr1 and cyp19a1b.

Alteration of this behaviour due to xenooestrogens can potentially affect the reproductive output and consequently population dynamics. In this lifetime study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to environmentally realistic (0.05, 0.50 and 5.00 ng L-1) nominal concentrations of 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2) in a flow-through system for 4 months, from egg until sexual maturity. At 0.05 ng EE2 L-1, the secondary sexual characteristics of the males were significantly feminised with development of urogenital papillae and change in body colour. At 0.50 ng EE2 L-1, the sex ratio was altered from 69% males in the control groups to 59% males. The courtship behaviour of the male zebrafish was not affected by these two lower EE2 concentrations. Only at the highest concentration of 5.00 ng EE2 L-1, where only 5% of the group developed into males, was a change in behaviour recorded, and these few males were unable to induce spawning. Accordingly, the courtship behaviour of zebrafish is more resistant to oestrogenic exposure than secondary sexual characteristics and gonad development. This study provides the first quantitative measure of zebrafish courtship behaviour. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is unknown whether wild fish which are exposed to effluent actually compete with unexposed fishes, how long effects of estrogen exposure last, and whether females are affected by estrogens. This study addressed these issues using the fathead minnow (FHM) and effluent from the Metropolitan Wastewater Treatment Plant (MWTP) a well-studied source of environmental estrogens (EEs) in the Mississippi River. Maze tests found that adult FHMs are neither attracted nor repelled by MWTP effluent while previous studies have shown that minnows are attracted to the warmer waters which characterize effluents; it is realistic that previously unexposed fish enter MWTP effluent in the spring and then compete with exposed individuals. Competitive spawning experiments showed that male FHMs exposed to 44 ng E2/l (a high but realistic level) for three weeks failed to compete with unexposed males while males exposed to 4 ng E2/l outcompeted and sired more young than unexposed males (p < 0.05). The effects of estrogen exposure disappeared within a week of moving fish into uncontaminated water. Female FHM reproductive output and behavior were unaffected by exposure to estrogen. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the behavior of wild fishes likely determines their exposure to EEs and that while the effects of this exposure are likely significant to populations of wild fish, they will be location specific because of factors which determine the duration and intensity of male exposure. We conclude that the role of fish behavior in endocrine disruption strongly warrants additional consideration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Sex differentiation is influenced by a combination of hormonal, social and environmental factors and teleost fishes exhibit many examples of hermaphroditism. This means that the brain of fish is not irreversibly sexualized early in life. This review aims at highlighting some unique features of fish that may explain their brain sexual plasticity. Unlike mammals, in which brain aromatase activity decreases after birth, adult teleosts exhibit an intense aromatase activity due to strong expression of one of two aromatase genes (aromatase A or cyp19a1a and aromatase B or cyp19a1b) that arose from a gene duplication event. Interestingly, aromatase B is only expressed in radial glial cells (RGC) of adult fish. These cells persist throughout life and act as progenitors in the brain of both developing and adult fish. In agreement with the fact that brain aromatase activity is correlated with sex steroid levels, the high expression of cyp19a1b is due to an autoregulatory loop through which estrogens and aromatizable androgens upregulate aromatase expression. Given the well-established roles of estrogens and aromatase on brain sexualization, these features suggest that the brain of fish conserves properties of embryonic mammalian brain throughout life - high neurogenic activity and high aromatase expression in progenitor cells correlated with sex steroid levels. The permanent dialogue between the brain and the gonad would permit sex changes and thus the emergence of a variety of reproductive strategies. Other hypotheses are also discussed.","[Le Page, Yann; Diotel, Nicolas; Vaillant, Colette; Pellegrini, Elisabeth; Anglade, Isabelle; Merot, Yohann; Kah, Olivier] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6026, IFR 140, Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Kah, O (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6026, IFR 140, Rennes, France.",olivier.kah@univ-rennes1.fr,"Diotel, Nicolas/Y-1126-2019; Vaillant-Capitaine, Colette CVC/K-1734-2015; kah, olivier/K-7624-2012; Pellegrini, Elisabeth/K-1705-2015; Le Page, yann/K-2868-2015","Diotel, Nicolas/0000-0003-2032-518X; Le Page, yann/0000-0002-7194-8267",European project (LIFECYCLE) [222719]; ANR NEED [CES 2008-011]; Programme Post-Grenelle de l'Environnement NEMO,European project (LIFECYCLE); ANR NEED(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Programme Post-Grenelle de l'Environnement NEMO,"Unpublished data mentioned in this manuscript were supported by the European project no 222719 (LIFECYCLE), the ANR NEED (CES 2008-011) and the Programme Post-Grenelle de l'Environnement NEMO.",,170,80,85,1,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0953-816X,1460-9568,,EUR J NEUROSCI,Eur.

Roach were exposed as embryos from fertilization up to 300 days posthatch (dph; to include the period of gonadal sex differentiation) or as postspawning adult males, and including fish that had received previous estrogen exposure, for either 60 or 120 days when the annual event of germ cell proliferation occurs. Both effluents induced vitellogenin synthesis in both life stages studied, and the magnitude of the vitellogenic responses paralleled the effluent content of steroid estrogens. Feminization of the reproductive ducts occurred in male fish in a concentration-dependent manner when the exposure occurred during early life, but we found no effects on the reproductive ducts in adult males. Deputation studies (maintenance of fish in clean water after exposure to WwTW effluent) confirmed that the feminization of the reproductive duct was permanent. We found no evidence of ovotestis development in fish that had no previous estrogen exposure for any of the treatments. In wild adult roach that had previously received exposure to estrogen and were intersex, the degree of intersex increased during the study period, but this was not related to the immediate effluent exposure, suggesting a previously determined programming of ovotestis formation.","Hatherly Labs, Sch Biosci, Environm & Mol Fish Biol Grp, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; Brunel Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Aquat Ecotoxicol Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; Environm Agcy, Waterlooville, England",University of Exeter; Brunel University,"Liney, KE (corresponding author), Hatherly Labs, Sch Biosci, Environm & Mol Fish Biol Grp, Prince Wales Rd, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",k.e.liney@exeter.ac.uk,"jobling, susan/N-9316-2016","jobling, susan/0000-0002-9322-9597",,,,,61,99,113,2,37,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

We conducted three experiments to assess the impacts of exposure to 17alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) on the ability of male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to establish and defend a spawning territory. Fish were exposed to EE2 (2 or 8 ng L(-1)) for 27 days, while spawning conditions were gradually optimized. Control (ethanol only) males (C) were paired with treated males (L = low dose, H = high dose) (experiment 1) or individuals from their own treatment group (experiment 2) in competition for a nest site. Solitary males occupied a nest site prior to adding a second male from the same treatment group in experiment 3. Behaviour was quantified from video records. Exposure to EE2 impaired a male's ability to compete and acquire territories compared to unexposed individuals (experiment 1), but was similar when males were paired with like-treated conspecifics (experiments 2 and 3). Higher levels of overall aggression (aggression rates of both fish) occurred in Cvs.L and Cvs.H than Cvs.C trials (experiment 1).

Male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed for three weeks to either blank control, effluent released by a sewage treatment plant (STPE), waterborne estradiol (E-2), or a synthetic androgen (methyltestosterone [MT]). Afterward, fish were placed with females and a nest, and their behavior was monitored for 5 d in either the presence or the absence of a competing (unexposed control) male. Males exposed to either the STPE or E-2 (similar to 50 ng/L, a level chosen to mimic the estrogenic content of the STPE) had elevated levels of circulating vitellogenin (p < 0.05) and lower levels of I I-ketotestosterone (KT; p < 0.05). Nearly all STPE- and E-2-exposed males spawned successfully in the absence of a competing male, but in both cases, exposed males suffered nearly total reproductive failure when they had to compete. Conversely, males exposed to MT (similar to 50 ng/L) outcompeted control males. Behavioral observations suggested that subtle differences in agonistic behaviors, typically associated with circulating androgens (i.e., KT), were responsible. We speculate that male fish exposed to estrogenic effluent in the field are less likely to reproduce successfully within large populations of wild fish, thereby causing abnormal and potentially detrimental patterns of gene flow within those populations.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Sorensen, PW (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, 1980 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",soren003@umn.edu,,"Martinovic-Weigelt, Dalma/0000-0002-9973-4965; Sorensen, Peter/0000-0003-0321-1279",,,,,40,110,131,4,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0730-7268,1552-8618,,ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM,Environ.

The objectives of this study were to compare the effects of emerging and prevalent environmental contaminants on the expression of brain transcripts with a role in neurotransmitter synthesis and reproduction. Adult male largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were injected once for a 96 h duration with control (water or oil) or with one of two doses of a single chemical to achieve the following body burdens (mu g/g): atrazine (0.3 and 3.0), toxaphene (10 and 100), cadmium (CdCl2) (0.000067 and 0.00067), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 126 (0.25 and 2.5), and phenanthrene (5 and 50). Partial largemouth bass gene segments were cloned for enzymes involved in neurotransmitter (glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, GAD65; tyrosine hydroxylase) and estrogen (brain aromatase; CYP19b) synthesis for real-time PCR assays. In addition, neuropeptides regulating feeding (neuropeptide Y) and reproduction (chicken GnRH-II, cGnRH-II: salmon GnRH, sGnRH) were also investigated. Of the chemicals tested, only cadmium, PCB 126, and phenanthrene showed any significant effects on the genes tested, while atrazine and toxaphene did not. Cadmium (0.000067 mu g/g) significantly increased cGnRH-II mRNA while PCB 126 (0.25 mu g/g) decreased GAD65 mRNA. Phenanthrene decreased GAD65 and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA levels at the highest dose (50 mu g/g) but increased cGnRH-II mRNA at the lowest dose (5 mu g/g). CYP19b, NPY, and sGnRH mRNA levels were unaffected by any of the treatments. A hierarchical clustering dendrogram grouped PCB 126 and phenanthrene more closely than other chemicals with respect to the genes tested. This study demonstrates that brain transcripts important for neurotransmitter synthesis neuroendocrine function are potential targets for emerging and prevalent aquatic contaminants.

Survival to reproductive age relies upon optimal non-reproductive trait expression, such as adequate predator avoidance responses, which may be impacted through EDC exposure. During a predator-prey confrontation, larval fish use an innate C-start escape behavior to rapidly move away from an approaching threat. We tested the hypotheses that (1) larval fathead minnows exposed to estrogens, a primary class of EDCs, singularly or in mixture, suffer a reduced ability to perform an innate C-start behavior when faced with a threat stimulus; (2) additive effects will cause greater reductions in C-start behavior; and (3) effects will differ among developmental stages. In this study, embryos (post-fertilization until hatching)were exposed for 5 days to environmentally relevant concentrations of estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) singularly and in mixture. Exposed embryos were allowed to hatch and grow in control well water until 12 days old. Similarly, post-hatch fathead minnows were exposed for 12 days to these compounds. High-speed (1000 frames/s) video recordings of escape behavior were collected and transferred to National Institutes of Health Image for frame-by-frame analysis of latency period, escape velocity, and total escape response (combination of latency period and escape velocity). When tested 12 days post-hatch, only El adversely affected C-start performance of larvae exposed as embryos. Conversely, larvae exposed for 12 days post-hatch did not exhibit altered escape responses when exposed to Ell, while adverse responses were seen in E2 and the estrogen mixture. Ethinylestradiol exposure did not elicit changes in escape behaviors at either developmental stage. The direct impact of reduced C-start performance on survival, and ultimately, reproductive fitness provides an avenue to assess the ecological relevance of exposure in an assay of relatively short duration.

In this study, a predictive model was developed to translate changes in fecundity of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) in a short-term laboratory toxicity test to alterations in population growth rate. The model uniquely combines a Leslie population projection matrix and the logistic equation. Application of the model requires only a life table for the organism of interest, a measure of carrying capacity for the given population. and an estimation of the effect of a stressor on vital rates. The model was applied to investigate population dynamics for fathead minnow exposed to the androgen receptor agonist 17beta-trenbolone. Organismal-level responses for fathead minnows exposed to varying levels of 17beta-trenbolone were used to determine projected alterations in a population existing in a small body of water containing varying concentrations of the androgen. Fathead minnow populations occurring at carrying capacity and subsequently exposed to 0.027 mug/L of 17beta-trenbolone exhibited a 51% projected decrease in average population size after 2 years of exposure. Populations at carrying capacity exposed to concentrations of 17beta-trenbolone greater than or equal to0.266 mug/L exhibited a 93% projected decrease in average population size after 2 years of exposure. Overall, fathead minnow populations exposed to continued concentrations of 17beta-trenbolone equal to or greater than 0.027 mug/L were projected to have average equilibrium population sizes that approached zero.

Consequently, spatial differences or temporal changes in the concentrations of lipophilic compounds in chinook salmon or lake trout may significantly influence the concentrations of these compounds in their eggs.","UNIV WISCONSIN,CTR LIMNOL,MADISON,WI 53706",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,,,,,,,,,56,96,103,2,26,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0706-652X,,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Overall, data from laboratory experiments support the hypothesis that EDCs in the aquatic environment can impact the reproductive health of various fish species, but evidence that EDCs in the aquatic environment are actually impacting the reproductive health and sustainability of indigenous fish populations is less convincing. The scarcity of evidence linking impacts of environmental EDCs with changes in reproductive success of indigenous fish populations may reflect a critical need for a dependable method or indicator to assess reproduction of fish in situ. In addition, more studies that investigate whether fish populations routinely exposed to EDCs in situ are experiencing changes in population structure are needed. Linking endocrine disruption and reproductive impairment with an ecologically relevant impact on the sustainability of real fish populations remains, with few exceptions, an open challenge.

Endocrine disrupting chemicals have been defined as exogenous agents that interfere with the synthesis, secretion, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones in the body. Previous research conducted in our laboratory suggests that perinatal exposure to fenvalerate, a type-II pyrethroid, interferes with brain sexual organization in male pups, probably acting on a critical perinatal hormone-related period. In the present study we investigate the effects of maternal exposure to fenvalerate (FV) during the prenatal and postnatal periods of sexual brain organization of female offspring. Behavioral (open-field, stereotyped and sexual behaviors), physical (sexual maturation, body and uterine weights), and neuroendocrine (estrous cycle and gonadal hormone levels) parameters were assessed. Results show that 1) sexual maturation was delayed, albeit body weight was unchanged until adulthood; 2) there was a reduction in sexual behavior; 3) the estrous cycle was abnormal, and the uterine weight at different phases of the estrous cycle was modified; 4) gonadal hormone levels in the plasma were not affected, neither was stereotypy nor open-field behaviors. These results were attributed to an anti-estrogenic effect of perinatal exposure to FV during the critical periods of female brain sexual organization.

For example, some personality syndromes suggest the existence of an underlying hormonal link, whereas other relationships between boldness and aggression appear to be the result of similar selective pressures. Here, we used 1 wild-derived and 2 laboratory strains of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to examine relationships among 5 behavioral measures: shoaling, activity level, predator approaches, latency to feed after a disturbance, and biting to a mirror stimulus. We found evidence of an activity syndrome, as if underlying metabolic costs influence variation in multiple forms of behavior. Evidence for a relationship between boldness and aggression was also apparent but depended both on strain and which specific behavior patterns were identified as measures of boldness. Although some comparisons of laboratory and wild-derived strains were consistent with a domestication syndrome, others were not. Most observed relationships were relatively weak and occasionally inconsistent, arguing against strong underlying genetic linkages or pleiotropic effects relating any of the behavioral measures. Instead, it may be more important to study the details of selective context or the long-term impact of linkages between some, but not all, of a large set of genes influencing complex behavioral traits. We found profound differences among strains in most behavior patterns, but few sex differences. One strain (TM1) was consistently different from the others (SH and Nadia) being more social, more likely to approach predators, and taking less time to recover from disturbance than were the other 2 strains.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Indiana Univ, Ctr Integrat Study Anim Behav, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID USA; Univ Idaho, Ctr Reprod Biol, Moscow, ID USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Idaho; University of Idaho; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Martins, EP (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",emartins@indiana.edu,"Robison, Barrie/AGW-1927-2022","Martins, Emilia/0000-0002-8952-3240; Robison, Barrie/0000-0003-4458-926X",,,,,61,219,251,4,137,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Herein, we use strain differences among zebrafish, Danio rerio, as an experimental tool to test the effects of social experience on behavior. By manipulating the strain composition of groups in which the subject fish are housed at different ages, we tested (1) whether mixing with dissimilar individuals influenced subsequent behavior, (2) whether prolonged mixing during the juvenile stage had a more pronounced effect than a shorter period of mixing during adulthood and (3) whether mixing had a lasting effect after animals were resorted into groups of same strain animals. We found that social experience had a profound impact on social behavior. Both Nadia and TM1 individuals engaged in more frequent biting after having been in mixed strain groups compared to pure strain groups. This was true of groups mixed as juveniles, as well as adults, indicating that this response was not dependent on exposure during a critical developmental period. Also, TM1 fish (but not Nadia) having recently been housed in mixed-strain groups were more willing to leave the immediate vicinity of a shoal than were TM1 fish raised in pure strain groups. This change was more pronounced in groups mixed as juveniles than as adults. In addition, the observed changes persisted after mixed groups were separated into pure strain groups for a month. Other behavioral measures including Activity Level, Predator Response and Stress Recovery were unaffected by previous social experience.

After completion of gonadal development that is mediated by various hormones, oviparous teleosts perform a suite of behaviors, often termed as spawning behavior. This is particularly important for teleosts that have their gametes fertilized externally as the behavior patterns ensures the close proximity of both sexes for gamete release, fusion and ultimately the production of offspring. As in other vertebrates, sexual behavior of fish is also under the control of hormones. Testicular androgen is a requirement for male sexual behavior to occur in most fish species that have been studied. Unlike tetrapods, however, ovarian estrogen does not appear to be essential for the occurrence of female sexual behavior for fish that have their gametes fertilized externally. Prostaglandins produced in the ovary after ovulation act as a trigger in some teleosts to induce female sexual behavior. Potentiating effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the brain on sexual behavior are reported in some species. Under endocrine regulation, male and female fish exhibit gender-typical behavior during spawning, but in some fish species there is also some plasticity in their sexual behavior. Sex changing fish can perform both male-typical and female-typical sexual behaviors during their lifetime and this sexual plasticity can also be observed in non-sex changing fish when undergoing hormonal treatment. Although the neuro-anatomical basis is not clear in fish, results of field and laboratory observations suggest that some teleosts possess a sexually bipotential brain which can regulate two types of behaviors unlike most other vertebrates which have a discrete sex differentiation of their brain and can only perform gender-typical sexual behavior.

The relationships between dominance status and individual differences in foraging behaviour, habitat use, growth and emigration were examined for fluvial red-spotted masu salmon, Oncorhynchus masou ishikawai, in a mountain stream. 2. Size-structured linear dominance hierarchies were recognized among individuals inhabiting the same stream pools. Observations on space utilization and foraging behaviour revealed fish to be either territorial or nonterritorial. Within each local pool, dominant fish exclusively occupied the mid or surface layer of the pools as foraging territories, whereas subordinates adopted nonterritorial tactics, primarily utilizing the bottom layer. 3. Of the territorial fish, more dominant individuals tended to occupy focal points nearer the pool inlet, where they had priority of access to drifting food items. These fish showed higher actual foraging rates, feeding upon larger prey than their subordinates. This foraging advantage resulted in their having larger daily growth increments. 4. The more dominant fish in each pool exhibited a more sedentary tendency than their subordinates. Population densities in the pools did not fluctuate appreciably owing to both emigration of nonterritorial subordinates and immigration. 5. These results support the hypothesis that unequal resource partitioning among individuals subject to a dominance hierarchy plays an important role in their density-dependent population regulation.",,,"NAKANO, S (corresponding author), HOKKAIDO UNIV, FAC AGR, NAKAGAWA EXPTL FOREST, OTOINEPPU, HOKKAIDO 09825, JAPAN.",,,,,,,,50,272,299,2,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The pharmaceutical ethynylestradiol (EE2) is a potent endocrine modulator and is present in the aquatic environment at biologically active concentrations. To investigate impacts on reproductive success and mechanisms of disruption, we exposed breeding populations (n = 12) of zebrafish (Danio rerio) over multiple generations to environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2. Life-long exposure to 5 ng/L EE2 in the F, generation caused a 56% reduction in fecundity and complete population failure with no fertilization. Conversely, the same level of exposure for up to 40 days in mature adults in the parental F-0 generation had no impact on reproductive success. Infertility in the F, generation after life-long exposure to 5 ng/L EE2 was due to disturbed sexual differentiation, with males having no functional testes and either undifferentiated or intersex gonads. These F, males also showed a reduced vitellogenic response when compared with F-0 males, indicating an acclimation to EE2 exposure. Deputation studies found only a partial recovery in reproductive capacity after 5 months. Significantly, even though the F-0 males lacked functional testes, they showed male-pattern reproductive behavior, inducing the spawning act and competing with healthy males to disrupt fertilization. Endocrine disruption is therefore likely to affect breeding dynamics and reproductive success in group-spawning fish. Our findings raise major concerns about the population-level impacts for wildlife of long-term exposure to low concentrations of estrogenic endocrine disruptors.","Katholieke Univ Leuven, Aquat Ecol Lab, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; Univ Exeter, Sch Biol Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; RIVM, Bilthoven, Netherlands; INERIS, Verneuil En Halatte, France; HLUG, Wiesbaden, Germany",KU Leuven; University of Sheffield; University of Exeter; Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment,"Nash, JP (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Aquat Ecol Lab, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",jon@fishyone.net,"Rose, Rebecca J/B-7812-2011; BRION, Francois/Q-8713-2018","Maack, Gerd/0000-0001-5980-6533; BRION, Francois/0000-0003-2341-4196",,,,,65,483,571,8,252,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

The effect on reproductive success was assessed in the mating pairs, and sexual and nonsexual behaviors in the male were quantified. The fecundities of the E2-treated groups were reduced significantly (p < 0.05) compared with those of control, and the sexual behaviors (following, dancing, floating, and crossing) of male fish in response to prostaglandin F2alpha (PG)-injected E2-unexposed females were suppressed dramatically. While the fertility of spawned eggs and the frequencies of the nonsexual behaviors of resting and swimming in a straight line performed by male were unchanged in E2-exposed groups. Therefore, sexual behavior in male may be linked with reproductive success in mating pair of madaka exposed to E2.

In view of the high degree of territoriality and stylized courtship behavior shown by pomacentrid fishes, they are a highly suitable group for the investigation of the interaction between reproductive hormones and reproductive behavior in fishes. This review examines the association between hormones and behavior in the two pomacentrid species for which data are available, the demoiselle Chromis dispilus and the garibaldi Hypsypops rubicundus. Territory holding males of both species show elevated plasma levels of the androgens testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) in association with courtship display and spawning. The maturational steroid 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta P) is also elevated during the spawning phase in territorial male demoiselles. Non-territorial male demoiselles show similar cyclic changes in gonadal condition to territory holding males, but have lower plasma T and 11KT levels than territory holders during the spawning phase, and show no changes in plasma 17,20 beta P levels. Changes in hormone levels in both garibaldi and demoiselles do not appear to result simply from cyclic changes in gonadal condition. Plasma levels of T, 11KT and 17,20 beta P are absolutely higher in spawning phase male demoiselles from areas of high population density, than in those from areas of low population density. Territory holding fish at high density sites have more frequent territorial interaction with neighbours, and spawn more often than fish at lower densities. This suggests that behavioral interactions modify endocrine status, which may in turn regulate levels of aggression and synchronise male spawning readiness. Exogenous hormones administered to nesting phase male demoiselles were ineffective at inducing display behavior, further supporting the view that primarily, behavior modifies endocrine status in damselfishes, rather than the other way round.",,,"Pankhurst, NW (corresponding author), UNIV TASMANIA, DEPT AQUACULTURE, POB 1214, LAUNCESTON, TAS 7250, AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,,48,27,27,0,20,ROSENSTIEL SCH MAR ATMOS SCI,MIAMI,"4600 RICKENBACKER CAUSEWAY, MIAMI, FL 33149 USA",0007-4977,1553-6955,,B MAR SCI,Bull.

Fish were captured by SCUBA divers from natural populations on Australia's Great Barrier Reef and immediately bled underwater, following diver or video observation of precapture behaviour. In winter (July), most fish were nonterritorial, with a low proportion of mature males, or vitellogenic females present. In spring (November), most fish were territorial with broods of young at varying stages of maturity, and all stages of gonadal development were represented. Territorial males were larger than nonterritorial fish, but territorial fish that had large (older) young (the end of the brooding phase) had lower condition factors than fish at other stages. Males of all gonad stages had a high proportion of spermatozoa in the testis, but this was higher in November than in July. Ovaries of females commonly had several classes of developing follicles present, although fish that were brooding large young had regressed ovaries with a high incidence of atresia. Plasma levels of testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosterone were elevated in males of advanced gonadal maturity, and also in relation to recent or imminent spawning behaviour, but there were no changes in plasma 17,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta P), which was near assay detection limits at all times. Females had elevated T and 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) in association with vitellogenesis and elevated T in relation to spawning activity in some fish, but as in males, 17,20 beta P levels were low and unchanging. Territorial females without young had lower cortisol levels than nonterritorial fish, or females protecting young. The results confirm the importance of elevated androgens to spawning activity in territorial male fish, but not females where endocrine activity is more closely related to stage of ovarian development. Extended brooding appears to inhibit vitellogenesis, perhaps via a stress-related mechanism, (C) 1999 Academic Press.","Univ Tasmania, Sch Aquaculture, Launceston, Tas 7250, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Pankhurst, NW (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Aquaculture, POB 1214, Launceston, Tas 7250, Australia.",,,,,,,,47,60,67,0,14,ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0016-6480,,,GEN COMP ENDOCR,Gen.

The current investigation was designed to determine if water contaminated with pulp-mill effluent (PME) from the Fenholloway River in Florida displayed androgenic activity in vitro and to relate this activity to the reproductive status of female mosquitofish taken from this river. We tested water samples for androgenic activity from a reference site upstream of a Kraft pulp and paper mill on the Fenholloway River, from 3 sites downstream from the mill, and from another reference site on the Econfina. River, also in Florida, where there is no paper mill. We also examined anal fin ray morphology in mosquitofish from these rivers for evidence of masculinization. Eighty percent of the female mosquitofish from the Fenholloway River were partially masculinized while another 10% were completely masculinized, based upon the numbers of segments in the longest anal fin ray (18.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 28.1 +/- 0.9 [p < 0.001]) in the Econfina River vs. the Fenholloway River, respectively). In a COS whole cell-binding assay, all 3 PME samples displayed affinity for human androgen receptor (hAR) (p < 0.001). In addition, PME induced androgen-dependent gene expression in CV-1 cells (cotransfected with pCMV hAR and MMTV luciferase reporter), which was inhibited by about 50% by coadministration of hydroxyflutamide (1 muM), an AR antagonist. Water samples collected upstream of the Kraft mill or from the Econfina River did not bind hAR or induce luciferase expression. When CV-1 cells were transfected with human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) rather than hAR, PME failed to significantly induce MMTV-luciferase expression. Further evidence of the androgenicity was observed using a COS cell AR nuclear-translocalization assay. PME bound hAR and induced translocalization of AR into the nucleus. In contrast, AR remained perinuclear when treated with water from the control sites (indicating the absence of an AR ligand). Interestingly, PME also displayed testosterone-like immunoreactivity in a testosterone radioimmunoassay, whereas water from the reference sites did not. In summary, water collected downstream of the Kraft mill on the Fenholloway River contains unidentified androgenic substances whose presence is associated with masculinization of female mosquitofish.","US EPA, NHEERL, RTD, Endocrinol Branch, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; St Marys Coll Maryland, St Marys City, MD USA; US EPA, NHEERL, Mid Continent Ecol Div, Duluth, MN USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Gray, LE (corresponding author), US EPA, NHEERL, RTD, Endocrinol Branch, MD-72, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA.",gray.earl@epa.gov,,"gray jr, leon earl/0000-0002-1111-4754",,,,,45,216,250,1,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1096-6080,1096-0929,,TOXICOL SCI,Toxicol.

The fish were observed through the larval, juvenile, and adult stages. Growth, secondary sex characteristics, the liver somatic index, the gonadosomatic index, and fecundity were examined after several lengths of exposure. No significant changes were seen in fry or juvenile growth from 8 to 30 days posthatch (dph). An increase in the ovipositor index (a female secondary sex characteristic) was the most sensitive early response at 60 dph and was seen in fish exposed to EE2 concentrations >= 3.5 ng/L. Continuation of the EE2 exposure until 150 dph, through maturation and reproduction, allowed measurement of two sensitive end points: decreased egg fertilization and sex ratio (skewed toward females), both of which were significantly affected at the lowest EE2 concentration tested, 0.32 ng/L. The next most sensitive end point was demasculinization (decreased male secondary sex characteristic index) of males exposed to an EE2 concentration of 0.96 ng/L. The effects of low concentrations of EE2 (0.32 and 0.96 ng/L) were manifested in male fish (decreased male sex characteristics and reduced egg fertilization success), whereas female fish showed no changes in the gonaclosomatic index. Exposure to higher EE2 concentrations negatively affected females, as shown by a reduced gonadosomatic index at 150 dph in fish exposed to >= 3.5 ng/L EE2. Although there were some end points that showed changes at 60 dph, the reproductive end points and external sex characteristics measured in mature fish at 150 dph were more sensitive, with response thresholds of EE2 ranging from 0.32 to 0.96 ng/L. The concentrations of EE2 that negatively affected fathead minnows were similar to or lower than those detected in many municipal wastewater effluents. In conclusion, life-cycle exposure of fathead minnows proved to be a very sensitive bioassay, and responses were seen at concentrations of less than 1 ng/L, which are environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2.

There is, however, a paucity of information relating to the characterization of social groups and significance of dominance hierarchies in the zebrafish model. This study set out to bridge this knowledge gap and better characterize dominance and its implications for reproductive success in both male and female zebrafish in colonies comprising of two males and two females. Analyses of four aggressive behaviors (chase, bite, repel, spar) were conducted twice daily over a 5-day period, and fertilized eggs were collected for parentage analyses using DNA microsatellite markers. Dominant-subordinate relationships occurred both between males and between females, and in both sexes, dominance was associated with a greater body size and higher levels of aggression. During the spawning period, dominant females were, however, less aggressive toward their subordinates than dominant males to their subordinates. Aggressive behaviors employed for maintaining dominance did not differ between the sexes, but in females, in contrast with males, the level of aggression directed toward the subordinate fish increased over the study period. Overall, dominance resulted in a greater total reproductive success in males but not in females; however, dominant females sired more offspring with the dominant male. The findings illustrate that energy invested in dominance behavior appears beneficial for both sexes in zebrafish.","[Paull, Gregory C.] Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Hatherly Labs, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Paull, GC (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Hatherly Labs, Prince Wales Rd, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",g.c.paull@exeter.ac.uk,"Filby, Amy L/F-8546-2010",,"Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; University of Exeter; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G019355/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/G019355/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); University of Exeter; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","The authors thank Dr. Carl Smith of the University of Leicester, United Kingdom, for his kind gift of the wild F2 generation zebrafish.

In this assay, mature male and female fathead minnow, previously kept under simulated winter conditions (15 degreesC; 8:16 h light:dark regime) were transferred to simulated summer conditions (25 degreesC water temperature; 16:8 h light:dark regime) to induce gonadal recrudescence. To assess sexual development fish were exposed to nominal concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 5 and 50 mug/L 17alpha-methyltestosterone. After 3 weeks of chemical exposure, effects on condition (condition factor, CF), plasma vitellogenin (VTG), secondary sex characteristics, gonad growth (gonadosomatic index; GSI) and gonad histology were investigated. Reproductive performance, including reproductive output (egg production), spawning behaviour, and fertilisation rate were measured over a subsequent 3-week-period in breeding adults maintained in clean water. 17alpha-Methyltestosterone had no effects on the condition of fish at any of the doses tested. 17alpha-Methyltestosterone induced both androgenic and estrogenic effects with females generally more affected by 17alpha-methyltestosterone than males: atretic follicles and male-specific sex characteristics (androgenic effect) were induced in females at greater than or equal to0.1 and greater than or equal to1 mug/L 17alpha-methyltestosterone, respectively. An inhibitory effect on ovary growth occurred at an exposure concentration of 50 mug/L 17alpha-methyltestosterone. In males 1 mug/L 17alpha-methyltestosterone induced a concentration-response induction of plasma vitellogenin (estrogenic effect) likely due to its conversion into 17alpha-methylestradiol, rather to the competition with endogenous steroids and their cross reactivity with the estrogen receptor. In the fish breeding studies, concentration-dependent reductions in egg number, fertilisation rate and increases in abnormal sexual behaviour in females were observed. All of these effects occurred at exposure concentrations of greater than or equal to5 mug/L 17alpha-methyltestosterone. Thus, it could be assumed that the observed estrogenic effects in male fathead minnow were likely to the conversion of 17alpha-methyltestosterone into the estrogen 17alpha-methylestradiol, rather to the acting of 17alpha-methyltestosterone itself. In conclusion to this, showing hormonally activity of 17alpha-methyltestosterone in fish down to 100 ng/L, indicates that its potency was close to the range of several naturally occurring estrogens.

The modified hemal spines (modified skeletal structures important in reproduction) of mosquitofish, Gambusia spp. have been shown to be under androgenic control and to be affected by exposure to estrogen. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of two sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Sydney, Australia on the morphology of hemal spines in populations of Gambusia holbrooki and on the ability of the fish to reach sexual maturity. The effluent from the two STPs had different effects on the hemal spines of males. At St. Marys differences in hemal spine morphology between fish upstream and downstream of the STP were not attributable to effluent from the STP. At Quakers Hill, results suggest that the effluent is generally estrogenic to G. holbrooki. There was a decrease in the proportion of males that were morphologically mature downstream of both STPs indicating potential population level effects that were associated with the presence of the STPs.

Research into the genetic changes associated with the domestication process in many endangered species is impeded by a lack of genomic tools, long generation times, and large space requirements. The study of the genetics of fish domestication could therefore benefit from the introduction of a model system. In this paper, we document behavioral and growth rate differences observed between a domesticated laboratory strain of zebra danio (Danio rerio) and a strain newly introduced into the laboratory from its native habitat in India. Domesticated zebra danio showed a higher degree of surface orientation, a reduced startle response, and higher growth rate compared with wild zebra danio. Wild-domesticated interstrain hybrids were intermediate in phenotype for all traits. When strains were reared together, most interstrain behavioral differences were maintained, indicating a genetic basis underlying the interstrain phenotypic variation. Phenotypic differences observed in this study are consistent with the effects of domestication in other fish species, indicating that the zebra danio can be used as a model system for studying the genetics of the domestication process in fish.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Robison, BD (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, POB 443051, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",brobison@uidaho.edu,"Robison, Barrie/AGW-1927-2022","Robison, Barrie/0000-0003-4458-926X",,,,,34,69,82,1,35,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0706-652X,,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

The greatest differences are between guppies that co-exist with different predators. Here, the sexual behaviour of male Trinidadian guppies was studied to determine to what extent these differences in behaviour evolved in response to selection pressure by the predators, to what extent they are an environmentally induced response to aspects of guppy biology that covary with the predators and to what extent these factors interact. To do this, male offspring of guppies from different predator localities were reared in the laboratory under conditions designed to mimic natural variation in wild populations. Two aspects of young male guppies' social environment were manipulated: (1) population demography and (2) origin (predator locality) of conspecifics. Heredity (origin of the males' parents) was responsible for only a small proportion of the variation in sexual behaviour; social environment had a much greater influence. Also, inter-population variation was found in the degree to which a male's behaviour was affected by demographic conditions and in the relationship between a male's body size and his rate of courtship. Male sexual behaviour also varied with male age and with the origin of the female being courted. Various components of male sexual behaviour (e.g. courtship, mating attempts) were influenced to different degrees by the factors examined. Therefore, inter-population differences in male sexual behaviour result from complex interactions between heritable factors, social environment, male age and male size.","YORK UNIV, DEPT BIOL, 4700 KEELE ST, N YORK, ON M3J 1P3, CANADA",York University - Canada,,,,,,,,,91,78,88,0,65,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0003-3472,1095-8282,,ANIM BEHAV,Anim.

The incidence of intersexuality is strongly correlated with discharges of estrogenic treated sewage effluent into those rivers, and this has led to the hypothesis that estrogenic chemicals in effluents are feminizing wild male fish. In this study, early-life stage roach (50 days post hatch, dph) were exposed for 150 days to a graded concentration (0%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, and 100%) of treated sewage (primarily domestic) effluent to examine the effects of exposure on sexual differentiation and development. Measurement of steroid estrogens and alkylphenolic chemicals in the effluent and a resulting dose-dependent induction of vitellogenin (VTG; a female-specific, estrogen-dependent plasma protein) confirmed that the fish had been exposed and responded to estrogen in the effluent. Exposure to treated sewage effluent induced feminization of the reproductive ducts in male roach in a dose-dependent manner (in full-strength effluent, 100% of the fish had feminized ducts), indicating that the disruption of the gonad ducts seen in wild roach is the result of exposure to treated sewage effluents during early-life stages. There were no effects of treated sewage effluent exposure on germ cell development; therefore, no oocytes occurred in the testes of the feminized male roach. Subsequent, depuration of the effluent exposed fish in clean water for 150 days resulted in a reduction in plasma VTG but no alteration of the feminized ducts, indicating that the effect of the treated sewage effluent on reproductive duct development was permanent. The causality of oocytes in the testes of wild male roach therefore remains to be elucidated.","Brunel Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fish Physiol Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; CEFAS Fisheries Lab, Burnham On Crouch CM0 8HA, Essex, England; UK Environm Agcy, Natl Ctr Ecotoxicol Hazardous Subst, Wallingford, England; Univ Exeter, Sch Biol Sci, Hatherly Labs, Environm & Mol Fish Biol Re Grp, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England",Brunel University; Centre for Environment Fisheries & Aquaculture Science; University of Exeter,"Rodgers-Gray, TP (corresponding author), Brunel Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fish Physiol Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",Trevor.Rodgers-Gray@brunel.ac.uk,"jobling, susan/N-9316-2016; sumpter, john/HGB-7584-2022","jobling, susan/0000-0002-9322-9597;",,,,,28,211,243,1,47,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

In this study, profiling of AA contaminants in WwTW effluents and fish was conducted using HPLC in combination with in vitro androgen receptor transcription screens. Analysis of extracts of wastewater effluents revealed complex profiles of AA activity comprising 21-53 HPLC fractions. Structures of bioavailable antiandrogens were identified by exposing rainbow trout to a WwTW effluent and profiling the bile for AA activity using yeast (anti-YAS) and mammalian-based (AR-CALUX) androgen receptor transcription screens. The predominant fractions with AA activity in both androgen receptor screens contained the germicides chlorophene and triclosan, and together these contaminants accounted for 51% of the total anti-YAS activity in the fish bile. Other AA compounds identified in bile included chloroxylenol, dichlorophene, resin acids, napthols, oxybenzone, 4-nonylphenol, and bisphenol A. Pure standards of these compounds were active in the androgen receptor screens at potencies relative to flutamide of between 0.1 and 13.0.

They are known to cause impairment of reproduction of aquatic organisms at very low concentrations. The aim of this study was to examine how exposure from 10 to 31 days to 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2, 41 ng L-1) affects the courtship and parental care behaviour of male sand gobies (Pomatoschistus minutus). The sand goby exhibits a polygynous mating system, where males compete for females and provide paternal care. First, male courtship performance towards a stimulus female was recorded with video camera. Secondly, after the male had received eggs his parental care behaviour was video recorded. In addition to behavioural endpoints, we measured the expression of hepatic vitellogenin (Vtg) and zona radiata protein (Zrp) mRNA, as well as common somatic indices. Our study shows that exposure to EE2 affected male fanning behaviour during both courtship and parental care. Interestingly, small exposed males increased their courtship fanning to similar levels as larger control males. However, during parental care egg fanning was not related to male size, and all exposed males fanned more than control males. The EE2-exposure induced Vtg and Zrp mRNA expression in males and decreased hepatosomatic index (HSI), and increased gonadosomatic index (GSI). Females prefer males that fan more, which will favour the small EDC exposed males. This may lead to mating that favours males that are not strong enough to tend the eggs until they hatch, thus decreasing the reproductive success of individuals. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our study species, the sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus) exhibits a polygynous mating system, in which males compete for females and defend their nest against intruders. Nest takeovers are common in their nest-constrained habitat. In our experiment, control and EE2-exposed males were first allowed to build a nest and mate with non-exposed females. When the males had received eggs in their nest, three rival males were introduced into the test aquarium, and the males were left to compete for the nest site overnight. Courtship and aggressive defence behaviour were recorded using a video camera. In addition to behavioural endpoints we measured the expression of hepatic vitellogenin (Vtg) and zona radiata protein (Zrp) mRNA, and several common somatic indices. Our study showed that exposure to EE2 delays nest building and decreases male courtship and leading behaviour. Additionally, EE2-exposed males were significantly less aggressive than control males. Nest takeover rate was not affected by EE2 exposure: an equal percent of males in both treatments lost their nest to competitors. EE2 exposure also induced Vtg and Zrp mRNA expression in males and decreased the hepatosomatic index. The observed changes in nest building, courtship and aggressive behaviour of EE2-exposed males are likely to have negative implications for male reproductive success. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

So far, few studies have demonstrated the effect of EDCs on the reproductive behavior of aquatic wildlife. Here we show that sand goby males' (Pomatoschistus minutus) success in mating competition greatly decreases after an exposure for 7 to 24 days to 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2, measured concentration 4 ng L-1). The sand goby exhibits a polygynous mating system with male parental care, in which males compete for nest sites and females. The aim of this study was to test how EE2 exposure affects the ability of males to compete for breeding resources, i.e. nest sites and mates. First, EE2 exposed males competed over a nest site against a non-exposed, control male of the same size. Secondly, we examined male courtship behavior and female mate preferences for EE2 exposed males and similar-sized non-exposed, control males. In addition to the behavioral experiments we determined the zona radiata protein (Zrp) mRNA gene expression and measured morphometric indicators of sexual maturation. Our study revealed that EE2 treated males were not able to acquire or defend a nest site. Additionally, EE2 treated males spent significantly less time in active courtship and nest leading behavior than control males. As a result, females clearly preferred to mate with control males. However, we found no significant differences in Zrp mRNA expression or the morphometric indicators between treatments. Our study illustrates that exposure to this EDC can greatly reduce the chances of an individual reproducing successfully. Moreover, it demonstrates that severe behavioral effects can be seen before any effects are detectable at the molecular or morphometric level. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The ability of male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to compete for, maintain, and defend a spawning substrate is paramount to reproductive success. The present study quantified alterations in male fathead minnow reproductive behaviors after exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (0, 10, 20, or 40 ng/L) of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) for 21 d. A video-based behavioral quantification system examined changes in male-male competitive behaviors (chasing and head-butting) and ability of males to maintain spawning substrates (nibbling and scrubbing). Behaviors analyzed included time under the spawning substrate, frequency of substrate cleaning, and conspecific aggression. Plasma hormone levels (11-ketotestosterone [11-KT], testosterone, and estradiol [E-2]), vitellogenin (VTG), secondary male characteristics (tubercle count and dorsal nape pad rank), gonadosomatic index (GSI), and gonad histology also were evaluated. Exposure to 40 ng/L of EE2 decreased the ability of exposed males to compete with control males for spawning substrates (p = 0.09). Furthermore, exposed males displayed reduced frequency of substrate cleaning activities as well as chasing male competitors (p <= 0.05). 11-Ketotestosterone, testosterone, and E-2 were lower, and VTG was notably higher, in EE2-exposed males compared with control males (p <= 0.03). 17 alpha-Ethinylestradiol exposure in males also was associated with reductions in tubercles; lower GSI, gonadal maturity ranks, and number of resorbed tubercles; and presence of an ovipositor (p <= 0.001). These data reveal alterations in male reproductive behavior that coincide with decreased hormone levels and secondary sex characteristics. Behavioral endpoints to discern potential ecological consequences in fish exposed to low concentrations of endocrine-disrupting chemicals may provide sensitive and functional indices of effect.","[Kane, Andrew S.] Emerging Pathogens Inst, Aquat Pathobiol Lab, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Salierno, James D.] Fairleigh Dickinson Univ, Dept Biol & Allied Hlth Sci, Madison, NJ 07940 USA; [Salierno, James D.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Kane, Andrew S.] Univ Florida, Environm Hlth Program, Coll Publ Hlth & Hlth Profess, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Fairleigh Dickinson University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Kane, AS (corresponding author), Emerging Pathogens Inst, Aquat Pathobiol Lab, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",kane@ufl.edu,,,,,,,52,87,98,0,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0730-7268,1552-8618,,ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM,Environ.

On the contrary, it is well known that estrogenic compounds can induce fish feminization. Yet, the combined effects of mixtures of androgenic and estrogenic compounds on fish sex differentiation have never been investigated before, even though in the environment animals are frequently exposed to both groups of xenobiotics. Therefore, in order to investigate whether exposure to estrogenic compounds can block the masculinizing effect of TBT, 5 days post-fertilization zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae were exposed for a four month period to TBT and to the synthetic estrogen-ethinylestradiol (EE2). The fish were fed a diet containing TBT at nominal concentrations of 25 and 100 ng TBT/g, and two groups of animals were also dosed with TBT plus EE2 at nominal water concentration of 3.5 ng/L, using a flow-through design. As expected, fish exposed to TBT showed a b. as of sex toward males (62.5% males in control tanks and 86% and 82% in TBT 25 and TBT 100 ng TBT/g, respectively). Co-exposure to EE2 completely blocked the masculinizing effect of TBT, with 7% males in the TBT 25 ng/g+EE2 treatment and 0% in the EE2 alone and in the TBT 100 ng/g+EE2 exposed groups. These results clearly indicate that EE2, at environmentally relevant concentrations, can block the TBT masculinizing effects in zebrafish, which suggests that in the aquatic environment the presence of estrogens may neutralize the fish masculinizing effect of TBT. Our findings highlight the need of testing the combined effects of contaminants, as single exposure studies may not be sufficient to predict the effects of mixtures of xenobiotics with antagonistic properties.

In this study, we examined the ability of NP to alter reproductive competence in male fathead minnows after a 28 day flow-through exposure in a range of environmentally relevant concentrations bracketing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency toxicity-based NP chronic exposure criterion of 6.1 mu g NP/L. Exposure to NP at and above the EPA chronic exposure criterion resulted in an induction of plasma vitellogenin (VTG) within 14 days. However, 7 days after the cessation of exposure, VTG concentrations had dropped more than 50% and few males expressed VTG above the detection threshold. All of the morphological endpoints, including gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index, secondary sexual characters, and histopathology, were unaltered by all NP treatments. However, when NP-exposed male fish were allowed to compete with control males for access to nest sites and females, most treatments altered the reproductive competence of exposed males. At lower NP concentrations, exposed males out-competed control males, possibly by being primed through the estrogenic NP exposure in a fashion similar to priming by pheromones released from female fathead minnows. At higher NP exposure concentrations, this priming effect was negated by the adverse effects of the exposure and control males out-competed treated males. Results of this study indicate the complexity of endocrine disrupting effects and the need for multiple analysis levels to assess the effects of these compounds on aquatic organisms.

This study tested the hypothesis that 10-week exposure to a STP effluent with well-established estrogenic properties compromises the reproductive vigor of mature goldfish by decreasing the intensity of their reproductive drive and sperm production, Male goldfish were exposed for 10 weeks to one of four treatments: well water, a solvent control, 50 ng/L estradiol (E2), or undiluted effluent from a major metropolitan STP. Two trials,were conducted, one in the winter and one in the summer when the effluent was chlorinated. Exposure to effluent in both the summer and winter trials induced small, but nonsignificant, decreases in the frequency of male spawning behaviors but had no effect on sperm production. Exposure to E2 caused a clear reduction in spawning behavior in one trial while causing reduced sperm production in both trials. We conclude that the effect of effluent exposure from this STP on adult fish is likely to be relatively minor and that the effluent's estrogenic properties may vary over the course of the year.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Guelph, Dept Zool, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Guelph,"Sorensen, PW (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, 1980 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",pws@fw.umn.edu,,"Schoenfuss, Heiko/0000-0001-5464-992X; Sorensen, Peter/0000-0003-0321-1279",,,,,40,46,49,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0730-7268,1552-8618,,ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM,Environ.

In the treated microcosms, time-weighted averages of EE concentration ranged between 7 and 220 ng/L during the dosing period, with concentration maxima up to 724 ng/L. EE exposure resulted in a decrease of species numbers and diversity (Shannon-Wiener, Simpson). Abundances of cladocerans, copepods, and, less unambiguously, rotifers declined. Strongest affected groups were the offspring of cladocerans and copepods and, on species level, the cladoceran species Daphnia longispina and Chydorus sphaericus as well as the rotifer species Keratella quadrata and Polyarthra sp. EE apparently affected the phosphate cycle as indicated by increased phosphate concentrations in the water. During post-treatment period, the treated microcosms recovered, but especially the highest treated microcosms did not fully re-approximate to the controls. Whereas EE affected cladocerans and copepods directly, shifts of rotifers may (partly) be caused indirectly, e.g. by competition with crustaceae. Although not providing an absolute proof, the traits of direct and indirect effects on different taxonomic groups and larval stages as well as the time course of the effects indicate that effects primarily resulted from endocrine activity of EE.

Accordingly, a great deal of previous research has characterized physiological mechanisms of toxicity in animals exposed to contaminants. In contrast, effects of contaminants on fish behaviour are less frequently studied. Because behaviour links physiological function with ecological processes, behavioural indicators of toxicity appear ideal for assessing the effects of aquatic pollutants on fish populations. Here we consider the many toxicants that disrupt complex fish behaviours, such as predator avoidance, reproductive, and social behaviours. Toxicant exposure often completely eliminates the performance of behaviours that are essential to fitness and survival in natural ecosystems, frequently after exposures of lesser magnitude than those causing significant mortality. Unfortunately, the behavioural toxicity of many xenobiotics is still unknown, warranting their future study. Physiological effects of toxicants in the literature include disruption of sensory, hormonal, neurological, and metabolic systems, which are likely to have profound implications for many fish behaviours. However, little toxicological research has sought to integrate the behavioural effects of toxicants with physiological processes. Those studies that take this multidisciplinary approach add important insight into possible mechanisms of behavioural alteration. The most commonly observed links with behavioural disruption include cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition, altered brain neurotransmitter levels, sensory deprivation, and impaired gonadal or thyroid hormone levels. Even less frequently studied are the implications of interrelated changes in behaviour and physiology caused by aquatic pollutants for fish populations. We conclude that future integrative, multidisciplinary research is clearly needed to increase the significance and usefulness of behavioural Judicators for aquatic toxicology, and aim to highlight specific areas for consideration.

Specific test guidelines for the detection of EDCs used for short-term fish screening assays have been developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Compared to the core species used in the OECD guidelines, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) has an additional and unique endpoint for (anti-)androgenic substances through the androgen-dependent glue protein (spiggin) used in the nest building. Here we describe a specific behavioural assay that was developed in parallel to the OECD protocol, utilising unique behavioural features of sticklebacks. In the assay, a photoperiod of 16L:8D (light:dark) and a temperature of 17 +/- 1 degrees C was used to induce breeding in quiescent male sticklebacks that were simultaneously exposed for a 21-day period to the mammalian anti-androgen flutamide (FL) at 100, 500 and 1000 mu g/l (plus a water control). Spiggin production and the reproductive behaviour (nest building and courtship) of male sticklebacks were the main measured endpoints. The control fish entered an active breeding cycle including nest building and courtship behaviours as expected due to the stimulating temperature and photoperiodic conditions. The FL-exposed males showed significantly lower spiggin levels at 500 and 1000 mu g/l. In addition, there was a significant decrease in the number of nests built by the FL-treated males at 100 mu g/l with no nest built at 500 and 1000 mu g/l. Finally, FL affected the courtship behaviour of the males with a significant reduction of the number of zigzags towards the female. When the breeding status of the stickleback males is controlled, the behavioural assay developed here is a suitable tool for the detection of androgen antagonists.

The potential for FN to act as an anti-androgen (at exposures of 1, 50, and 200 mu g FN/l over a 26-day period) was assessed in male three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, by measuring kidney spiggin concentration, nest-building, and courtship behavior. Spiggin is the glue protein that male sticklebacks use to build their nests and is directly controlled by androgens. FN exposure significantly reduced spiggin production as well as nest-building activity. It also adversely affected courtship-especially the 'zigzag dance' and biting behavior of the males. FN thus appears to have anti-androgenic effects on both the physiology and behavior of the male stickleback.","[Sebire, Marion; Scott, Alexander P.; Morris, Steve; Sanders, Matthew B.; Stebbing, Paul D.; Katsiadaki, Ioanna] Cefas Weymouth Lab, Weymouth DT4 8UB, Dorset, England; [Sebire, Marion; Tyler, Charles R.; Cresswell, James; Hodgson, Dave J.] Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Exeter, Devon, England",Centre for Environment Fisheries & Aquaculture Science; University of Exeter,"Katsiadaki, I (corresponding author), Cefas Weymouth Lab, Barrack Rd, Weymouth DT4 8UB, Dorset, England.",ioanna.katsiadaki@cefas.co.uk,"Katsiadaki, Ioanna/Y-1059-2019; Sebire, Marion/ISS-3157-2023; Scott, Alexander P/B-3845-2013","Sanders, Matthew/0000-0003-2450-381X; Katsiadaki, Ioanna/0000-0001-8649-2795; Scott, Alexander Pickering/0000-0002-5540-1317; Hodgson, Dave/0000-0003-4220-2076; Sebire, Marion/0000-0003-1646-9623","Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [CT20051]; NERC [NER/NE/E016634/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/E017363/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/E017363/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","The study was financially supported by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra, Grant number CT20051).

The exposure of parental (F-0) medaka to E-2 was begun on embryos within 12 h postfertilization and continued for up to 101 d; the assessment endpoints included embryological development, hatching, posthatch survival, growth, sexual differentiation, reproduction, and hepatic vitellogenin (VTG) levels under flow-through exposure to E-2 at each mean measured concentration of 0.939, 2.86, 8.66, 27.9, and 92.4 ng/L. Eggs (F-1) spawned from the F1 fish at 98, 99, and 100 d posthatch were also examined for hatchability, survival after hatching, growth, sexual differentiation, and hepatic VTG level until 59 d posthatch. In the F-1 medaka, no concentration-related effect of E-2 was observed on hatching, posthatch mortality, and growth. However, we observed abnormal sex differentiation, induction of VTG, and reproductive impairment in a dose-dependent manner. The lowest-observed-effect concentration and no-observed-effect concentration of E-2 for these effects were 8.66 and 2.86 ng/L, respectively. In the F-1 medaka treated with E-2 at <= 8.66 ng/L, however, dose-dependent effects were not observed in any parameter. The results indicate that E. can have significant effects on reproductive potential of medaka at concentrations as low,is 8.66 ng/L, suggesting that the ecological risk of E-2 is higher than that of weak estrogens, such as nonylphenol and octylphenol.","CERI, Kurume, Fukuoka 8390801, Japan",,"Seki, M (corresponding author), CERI, Kurume, Fukuoka 8390801, Japan.",seki-masanori@ceri.jp,,,,,,,31,47,59,0,15,SETAC,PENSACOLA,"1010 NORTH 12TH AVE, PENSACOLA, FL 32501-3367 USA",0730-7268,,,ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM,Environ.

However, fewer aquatic toxicological data on the effects of 17 alpha-estradiol, a diastereoisomer of 17 beta-estradiol, exists in the literature even though it has been found in the aquatic environment, sometimes at higher concentrations than 17 beta-estradiol. The central objective of this study was to determine how the anatomical, physiological, and behavioral effects of exposure to 17 alpha-estradiol compare to the well-documented effects of 17 beta-estradiol exposures in aquatic vertebrates. A 21-day flow-through exposure of mature male and female fathead minnows to three concentrations each of 17 alpha- and 17 beta-estradiol (averaged measured concentrations 27, 72, and 150 ng/L for 17 alpha-estradiol, and 9, 20, and 44 ng/L for beta-estradiol, respectively) yielded significant, concentration-dependent differences in plasma vitellogenin concentrations among estradiol-exposed males when compared to fish from an ethanol carrier control. Interstitial cell prominence in the testis of fish was elevated in all estradiol treatments. Aggressiveness of male fish to defend nest sites appeared depressed in many of the higher concentration estradiol treatments (albeit not significantly). No clear effects were observed in female fish. Based on plasma vitellogenin data, it appears that 17 beta-estradiol is 8-9 times more potent than 17 alpha-estradiol and that the lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC) for 17 alpha-estradiol in fathead minnows is greater than 25 ng/L and may be less than 75 ng/L.
