AB  - The acute effects of the organophosphate insecticide fenitrothion on Dicentrarchus labrax juveniles were investigated through a bioassay using biomarkers and swimming behaviour as effect criteria. After 96 h of exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of fenitrothion, the swimming velocity and several biomarkers were individually determined, namely: brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity; muscle cholinesterases (ChE), lactate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase activities; liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferases, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and lipid peroxidation levels (LPO). A significant decrease of the swimming velocity (LOEC = 2 mg l(-1)), an inhibition of both AChE (LOEC = 0.06 mg l(-1)) and ChE activities (LOEC = 0.03 mg l(-1)), and a positive and significant correlation between the swimming velocity and AChE were found in exposed fish, suggesting an influence of the inhibition of these enzymes in the swimming velocity decrease. An increase of EROD activity (LOEC = 1 mg l(-1)), indicating the involvement of this enzyme in fenitrothion biotransformation, and a negative and significant correlation between EROD activity and swimming velocity were also found, suggesting that the two findings may somehow be related. Furthermore, results show a significant induction of SOD (LOEC = 0.13 mg l(-1)) without LPO increase, suggesting that the enzyme is preventing oxidative stress damage. No significant alterations were found in any of the other parameters tested. Thus, exposure of seabass to fenitrothion in the wild at concentrations similar to those tested here may have adverse consequences at population level as neurotransmission and swimming ability are essential for fish performance and survival.

AB  - Red drum larvae (Sciaenops ocellatus) were exposed to environmentally realistic and sublethal levels of the herbicide atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamin-6-isopropylamino-S-triazine) to evaluate its effects on ecologically critical traits: growth, behavior, survival potential, and resting respiration rate. Settlement size larvae (7 turn total length) were given an acute exposure of atrazine at 0, 40, and 80 mu g l(-1) for 4 days. Tests of 96 h survival confirmed that these naturally occurring concentrations were sublethal for red drum larvae. Growth, routine swimming, antipredator responses to artificial and actual predators, and resting respiration rate were monitored I and 3 days after onset of exposure. Atrazine exposure significantly reduced growth rate. Atrazine-exposed larvae also exhibited significantly higher routine swimming speeds, swam in more convoluted paths, and were hyperactive. Responses to artificial and actual predators were not affected by atrazine exposure nor were resting respiration rates. The higher rate of travel (86% higher in atrazine-treated larvae) resulted in higher predicted encounter rates with prey (up to 71%) and slow moving predators (up to 63%). However, hyperactivity and faster active swimming speeds of exposed larvae indicated that naturally occurring sublethal levels of atrazine will result in an elevated rate of energy utilization (doubling the total metabolic rate), which is likely to increase the risk of death by starvation. Moreover, atrazine effects on growth will prolong the larval period, which could reduce the juvenile population by as much as 24%. We conclude that environmentally realistic levels of atrazine induce behavioral and physiological effects on fish larvae that would compromise their survival expectations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The majority of studies on pesticide impacts have evaluated the effects of single exposures. However, multiple exposures to a pesticide may be more prevalent. The objective Of our study was to determine how multiple exposures versus single exposure at different times during development affected survival to metamorphosis, tadpole Survival, tadpole mass. and tadpole developmental stage of green frog (Rana clamitans) tadpoles reared at low and high density in outdoor cattle tank ponds. Tadpoles were exposed to carbaryl zero, one, two, or three times at 14-d intervals. We applied single doses of carbaryl at one of three times, specifically during early, mid, or late development. Overall, we found that multiple exposures had a greater impact than single exposures during development. More individuals reached metamorphosis in ponds exposed to multiple doses of carbaryl compared with controls, indicating that the presence of carbaryl stimulated metamorphosis. The presence of carbaryl in the aquatic environment also resulted in more developed tadpoles compared with controls. Tadpoles in control ponds did not reach metamorphosis and were less developed than individuals exposed to carbaryl; this effect indicates that, under ideal conditions. green frogs Could overwinter in ponds so that greater size could be attained before metamorphosis in the following spring or Summer. Our study demonstrated the importance of including realistic application procedures when evaluating the effects of a pesticide and that Multiple exposures to a short-lived pesticide are more likely to affect an amphibian population.

AB  - We selected four metrics of swimming behavior (distance swam, speed, rate of turning, and tortuosity of path) and the commonly used biochemical marker, brain cholinesterase (ChE) activity, to assess (1) the sensitivity and reliability of behavior as a potential biomarker in monitoring work, (2) the potential for these endpoints to be used in automated monitoring, and (3) the linkage between behavior and its underlying biochemistry. Malathion-exposed fish exhibited large decreases in distance and speed and swam in a more linear path than control fish after 24 h exposure. By 96 h exposure, fish still swam slower and traveled less distance; fish fully recovered after 48 h in clean water. Diazinon-exposed fish exhibited decreases in distance, speed, and turning rate compared to controls. After 48 h recovery in clean water, fish exposed to diazinon had not recovered to control levels. The behavioral responses provided measures of neurotoxicity that were easily quantifiable by automated means, implying that the inclusion of behavior in monitoring programs can be successful. Furthermore, correlations between behavior and biochemical endpoints, such as ChE inhibition, suggest that this approach can provide a meaningful link between biochemistry and behavior and can provide useful information on toxicant impacts.

LA  - English
AB  - Insulin secretory activity was compared in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) versus the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat and Wistar rat. When the isolated pancreas was perfused with 16.7 mmol/L glucose, insulin release was significantly greater in the SHR versus the other groups. On the other hand, there was no difference in arginine (19 mmol/L)-induced insulin secretion among the three groups. To determine insulin biosynthesis during glucose stimulation, the pancreas was perfused with 16.7 mmol/L glucose for 180 minutes. Insulin secretion was greater in SHR versus WKY and Wistar rats, but the net increase in insulin content was not different between the three groups. These results strongly suggest that in vivo hyperinsulinemia in the SHR is associated with increased in vitro insulin secretion in response to glucose. The mechanisms by which enhanced glucose-induced insulin secretion is linked to hypertension in the SHR remain unclear.

AB  - Organochlorine pesticides such as endosulfan have been shown to have both lethal and sublethal effects on amphibians. In this context, behavioral endpoints have proved their usefulness in evidencing impacts of such chemicals at environmental concentrations that do not necessarily cause mortality. The recent development of video-tracking technologies now offers the possibility of accurately quantifying locomotor behaviors. However, these techniques have not yet been applied to evaluating the toxicity of pesticides in amphibians. We therefore aimed at determining the potential toxicity of endosulfan on endpoints associated with locomotion after short-term environmental endosulfan exposure in Rana temporaria tadpoles and at using these data as warning systems for survival alterations after a longer exposure. To this end, we analyzed video-tracks of 64 tadpoles (two pesticide treatments: Sand 50 mu g L-1, one control and one solvent-control) with Ethovision XT 7 software. The highest endosulfan concentration had a significant effect on all four behavioral endpoints. Contaminated tadpoles traveled shorter distances, swam less often, at a lower mean speed, and occupied a less peripherical position than control tadpoles. The lowest endosulfan concentration had similar but lower effects, and did not affect mean speed during swimming. Survival was reduced only after a long-term exposure to endosulfan and was associated with short-term behavioral dysfunctions. These results show that endosulfan strongly affects the behavioral repertory of amphibian tadpoles, but in different ways depending on concentration, thus suggesting that the pesticide has complex modes of action. Given the importance of locomotion and space use in tadpole success in their aquatic environment, these results confirm the toxic action of endosulfan. By highlighting effects before mortality markers, video-tracking systems also show their potential as sentinels of sublethal effects of pesticides. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pesticides and other chemicals often have detrimental effects at environmental concentrations. Many amphibian species are particularly threatened because of their susceptibility but also because wetlands are often polluted. Behavioral assessments of toxicity have the advantage of showing sublethal effects but quantitative measures at varied scales of integrations are rarely considered together. In this study, we aimed at showing that these behavioral endpoints could be differently affected across time and concentrations, and be biomarkers of toxicity. To this end, we tested the effects of an organochlorine pesticide (endosulfan) on amphibians during a standard 96 h test. We evaluated possible lag effects in continuing the analyses after removal of the pesticide. The study was based on 240 tadpoles (4 pesticide treatments: 0.4, 3, 22, and 282 mu g/l, 1 control and 1 solvent-control). Abnormal behaviors such as lying and swirling rapidly were exhibited only in the presence of the pesticide. Essential functions such as breathing and feeding were deeply affected by the pesticide: contaminated tadpoles breathed and fed less than control tadpoles. They also moved less and occupied a more central position in the aquariums in the presence of the pesticide. A higher mortality was only found at the highest concentration. These results suggest that endosulfan is toxic to amphibians at environmental concentrations. Behavioral markers showed potential as early warning systems. They should thus be used in complement to other markers to detect sublethal effects only a few days after application of the pesticide and at concentrations where mortality does not occur.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the acute effects of the pesticide carbofuran on the sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) using parameters at different levels of biological organisation (swimming behaviour and several biomarkers) and possible relationships between alterations found in different effect criteria. In a bioassay, sea bass juveniles were individually exposed to different doses of carbofuran (31, 63, 125 and 250 mu g/L) for 96 h. At the end of the bioassay, the swimming performance and 11 biomarkers were determined. Biomarkers were: hepatosomatic index (HSI), lipid peroxidation (LPO), reduced glutathione and the activities of the enzymes ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferases, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and muscle cholinesterases (ChE). After 96 h of exposure, carbofuran induced a decrease of the swimming velocity and inhibition of EROD activity at all concentrations tested, and inhibition of muscle ChE and brain AChE activities at 250 mu g/L. No relevant alterations in any of the other tested parameters were found. These results show that carbofuran induced adverse effects on fish by interfering with neurofunction, capability of detoxication and swimming velocity. In addition, positive and significant correlations between the swimming velocity and (i) brain AChE activity, (ii) muscle ChE activity and (iii) EROD activity suggest that the inhibition of these enzymes may somehow be related to the behavioural changes observed. Since these functions are determinant for the survival and performance of the fish in the wild, the findings of the present study suggest that adverse effects may occur in populations exposed to carbofuran if a sufficient number of animals is affected.

AB  - Alterations of fish behavioral responses are sensitive indicators to identify accidental chemical pollution. In this research, a series of exposure tests were conducted to investigate behavioral changes of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to deltamethrin (DM) in six concentrations of 0, 0.15, 1.5, 3.75, 7.5 and 15 g/L. Swimming changes in zebrafish were detected at a concentration as low as 1% of the LC50-24h within five hours. Hyperactivity was the first response, followed by a second response of fish surfacing. The change patterns of swimming speed in zebrafish were similar in all exposure groups, but the degree increased with increasing concentrations. Swimming speed and depth were altered within the first two hours after exposure, which was regarded as the most vital phase for water quality monitoring. The duration of hyperactivity and the time of zebrafish surfacing were both logarithmically correlated with exposure concentrations, which was helpful to distinguish the level of pollution.

AB  - Bifenthrin (BF) is widely used as a miticide in orchards, nurseries and homes due to its great photostability and insecticidal activity. Recently, extensive research has been conducted on the toxicity of BF in in vitro and in vivo assays. However, no data is so far available regarding the developmental toxicity of BF to fish in early life stages. In this study, the developmental effects of BF were evaluated in embryo-larval zebrafish. At specified stages (24, 48, 72, and 96 hpf), spontaneous movement, survival and hatching as well as non-lethal malformation like curved body axis or edema were described in detail. No significant lethal effects of the treatment group compared to the control occurred except for the highest concentration group exposed for 96 h. The hatching process was accelerated by BF in a concentration-dependent way, correlated with increasing spontaneous movement. Developmental abnormalities were observed for the test compound with 96-h EC50 of 256 mu g L-1 for pericardial edema, and 109 mu g L-1 for curved body axis. Results from locomotor assays showed that zebrafish larvae of 96 hpf exhibited impaired swimming behaviour after exposure to 50, 100, and 200 mu g L-1 from 3 to 84 hpf. After being cultured in the BF-free embryo medium for one more day till 120 hpf, larvae from the 50 mu g L-1 group seemed to have recovered and showed no difference in the swimming behaviour compared to the control while animals of the two higher concentration groups were exhausted and swam in significantly lower speed. Furthermore, reverse transcription real-time PCR results showed that vitellogenin I expressions were significantly induced in larval zebrafish exposed to 150 mu g L-1 BF for 72 h, indicating the disruption of the endocrine level. In summary, our studies showed that BF was developmentally toxic to zebrafish in early life stage after short-term exposure to sublethal concentrations and had the ability to impair the individual behaviours which are of great importance in the assessment of their ecological fitness.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is one of the most toxic pesticides in aquatic ecosystem, but its toxicity mechanisms to fish are still not fully understood. This study examined the toxicity targets of CPF in early life stage of zebrafish on the endpoints at developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, oxidative stress and immunotoxicity. Firstly, CPF exposure decreased the body length, inhibited the hatchability and heart rate, and resulted in a number of morphological abnormalities, primarily spinal deformities (SD) and pericardial edema (PE), in larval zebrafish. Secondly, the free swimming activities and the swimming behaviors of the larvae in response to the stimulation of light-to-dark photoperiod transition were significantly influenced by the exposure to 100 and 300 mu g/L CPF. In addition, the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the transcription of some genes related to neurotoxicity were also influenced by CPF exposure. Thirdly, CPF exposure induced oxidative stress in the larval zebrafish. The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased and the glutathione (GSH) contents decreased significantly in a concentration-dependent manner after the exposure to CPF for 96 hours post fertilization (hpf). CPF affected not only the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), but also the transcriptional levels of their respective genes. Finally, the mRNA levels of the main cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf alpha), interferon (Ifn), interleukin-1 beta (Il-1 beta), interleukin 6 (116), complement factor 4 (C4) in the larvae increased significantly after the exposure to 100 or 300 mu g/L CPF for 96 hpf, suggesting that the innate immune system disturbed by CPF in larvae. Taken together, our results suggested that CPF had the potential to cause developmental toxicity, behavior alterations, oxidative stress and immunotoxicity in the larval zebrafish.

LA  - English
AB  - 2,4-D was applied to a cove in Kentucky Lake which was highly infested with Myriophyllum spicatum (Eurasian watermilfoil). Effects of 2,4-D on nontarget algal communities were monitored concurrently in the field and in laboratory microcosms for eight days. Results indicated that indirect effects of water temperature and increased nutrient concentrations due to lysis in milfoil plants may be more important in the field community dominated by Chlorophyta, Pyrrhophyta, and Bacillariophyta. 2,4-D applied at the label-recommended rate of 2 mg/L or less stimulated total community growth in both laboratory and field indicating a possible hormonal effect of 2,4-D on algae. Reduced community growth and metabolism at high laboratory concentrations of 100 mg/L and 1000 mg/L may indicate an inhibitory effect on photosynthesis and/or respiration in algae. 2,4-D altered the laboratory community structure and function in all concentrations tested. Heterotrophic taxa such as Nitzschia, Euglena, Chlamydomonas, Mallomonas, Anabaena, and Oscillatoria appeared to be least affected by 2,4-D at high concentrations. Scenedesmus, Pediastrum, Characiosiphon, Navicula, Melosira, and Fragilaria appeared to be more sensitive, even in the lowest concentrations.

AB  - In western North America, mixtures of current use pesticides have been widely detected in streams and other aquatic habitats for threatened and endangered Pacific salmon and steelhead (Oncorhynchus sp.). These include organophosphate insecticides that inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme activity in the salmon nervous system, thereby disrupting swimming and feeding behaviors. Several organophosphates have been shown to interact as mixtures to produce synergistic AChE inhibition at concentrations near or above the upper range of surface water detections in freshwater systems. To evaluate potential synergism at lower concentrations (near or below 1 part per billion), juvenile coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were exposed to a range of mixtures of diazinon-malathion and ethoprop-malathion below a cumulative 0.05 of the predicted EC50 for AChE inhibition, as determined from single chemical concentration response curves. Brain enzyme inhibition was concentration-dependent, with a 90% reduction and a significant decrease in spontaneous swimming speed at the highest binary mixture concentrations evaluated (diazinon-malathion at 2.6 and 1.1 mu g/L, respectively; ethoprop-malathion at 2.8 and 1.2 mu g/L, respectively). Brain enzyme activity gradually recovered over six weeks. Our findings extend earlier observations of organophosphate synergism in salmon and reveal an unusually steep concentration response relationship across a mere 2-fold increase in mixture concentration.

AB  - Endosulfan is an organochlorine pesticide that was recently labeled as a persistent organic pollutant, but it is still widely employed, particularly in developing countries. The goal of this study is to evaluate the acute (LC50) and chronic effects (developmental and behavioural traits) of this insecticide on Rana dalmatina tadpoles after exposure to ecologically relevant concentrations (0.005, 0.01, and 0.05 mg/L) by applying video-tracking techniques to evaluate the quantitative effect of endosulfan on amphibian behavioural patterns. The 96 h LC50 value was 0.074 mg endosulfan/L. Tadpoles chronically exposed to 0.01 and 0.05 mg endosulfan/L underwent high mortality rate, decreased larval growth, delayed development, and increased incidence of malformations, and they did not reach metamorphosis by the end of the experiment. Moreover, tadpoles exposed to these concentrations exhibited several abnormalities in swimming patterns, such as shorter distance moved, swirling, resting, and unusual use of space. The exposure to 0.005 mg endosulfan/L did not cause any significant effects on behaviour, larval growth, or development, but we observed a significant decrease in both survival and time to metamorphosis. We showed that developmental abnormalities are dose-dependent and that the pesticide effects could differ depending on the endosulfan concentration and the species tested. We also validated the hypothesis that behavioural analysis, along with the use of new analytical methods, could be a useful tool in amphibian ecotoxicological studies.

AB  - The present study aimed to assess the environmental fate of the insecticide and nematicide ethoprophos in the soil-water interface following the pesticide application in simulated maize and potato crops under Mediterranean agricultural conditions, particularly of irrigation. Focus was given to the soil-water transfer pathways (leaching and runoff), to the pesticide transport in soil between pesticide application (crop row) and non-application areas (between crop rows), as well as to toxic effects of the various matrices on terrestrial and aquatic biota. A semi-field methodology mimicking a "worst-case" ethoprophos application (twice the recommended dosage for maize and potato crops: 100% concentration v/v) in agricultural field situations was used, in order to mimic a possible misuse by the farmer under realistic conditions. A rainfall was simulated under a slope of 20 for both crop-based scenarios. Soil and water samples were collected for the analysis of pesticide residues. Ecotoxicity of soil and aquatic samples was assessed by performing lethal and sublethal bioassays with organisms from different trophic levels: the collembolan Folsomia candida, the earthworm Eisenia andrei and the cladoceran Daphnia magna. Although the majority of ethoprophos sorbed to the soil application area, pesticide concentrations were detected in all water matrices illustrating pesticide transfer pathways of water contamination between environmental compartments. Leaching to groundwater proved to be an important transfer pathway of ethoprophos under both crop-based scenarios, as it resulted in high pesticide concentration in leachates from Maize (130 mu g L-1) and Potato (630 mu g L-1) crop scenarios, respectively. Ethoprophos application at the Potato crop scenario caused more toxic effects on terrestrial and aquatic biota than at the Maize scenario at the recommended dosage and lower concentrations. In both cropbased scenarios, ethoprophos moved with the irrigation water flow to the soil between the crop rows where no pesticide was applied, causing toxic effects on terrestrial organisms. The two simulated agricultural cropbased scenarios had the merit to illustrate the importance of transfer pathways of pesticides from soil to groundwater through leaching and from crop rows to the surrounding soil areas in a soil-water interface environment, which is representative for irrigated agricultural crops under Mediterranean conditions.

AB  - Amphibian population declines around the world are associated with invasive species, pesticides, pathogens, habitat destruction, or a combination of factors. Because contamination is widespread, it represents a relevant environmental stress that can affect the ability of organisms to deal with other factors present in the environment. We examined the effects of the insecticide malathion, larger tadpole competitors (green frogs, Rana clamitans), and a toxic cyanobacteria (Anabaena spp.) on tadpoles of Cope's gray treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis) reared from hatching through metamorphosis in outdoor mesocosms. The response of mass at metamorphosis and time to metamorphosis was significantly affected by exposure to malathion and presence of overwintered green frog tadpoles. Malathion generally led to increased mass at metamorphosis, earlier time to metamorphosis, and increased activity during larval development. These results likely stem from short-term increases in periphyton associated with malathion exposure (although these effects were nonsignificant). Exposure of gray treefrogs to overwintered green frog tadpoles led to an earlier time to metamorphosis without differences in mass at metamorphosis and was associated with increased activity in gray treefrogs. Survival of gray treefrogs was significantly affected by an interaction of green frog and malathion, indicating nonadditive effects of these treatments. Exposure to cyanobacteria had a significant negative effect on green frogs but no effect on treefrogs. Malathion had the strongest effect on the community, but our results indicated that some factors can interact in ways not predicted by single factors alone.

AB  - Roundup (TM) is a commonly used pesticide applied to agriculture and forest habitats. These areas are generally ideal for amphibians due to the presence of small, ephemeral water bodies. While Roundup (TM) has been shown to have lethal effects on many species of amphibians, effects on behaviour and sensory perception have yet to be considered. Here, we exposed wood frog tadpoles to a sub-lethal concentration of Roundup (TM) and showed that the ability of tadpoles to respond to injured conspecific cues, an important source of information regarding local predation risk, was impaired. Subsequent experiments revealed that impaired responses likely result from a chemical reaction between the Roundup (TM) and the cues and that tadpoles chronically exposed to Roundup (TM) had reduced basal movement rates compared with unexposed tadpoles. Our data demonstrate that environmentally-relevant concentrations of RoundupTm can drastically alter movement and anti-predator responses of tadpoles, with potential negative consequences for the population.

AB  - Constructed wetlands have been proposed as a potential best management practice (BMP) to mitigate effects of pesticide-associated agricultural runoff. Wetland mesocosms (14 m x 59-73 m) were amended with chlorpyrifos to simulate a storm runoff event at concentrations of 73, 147 and 733 mug/l. Water, sediment and plant samples collected weekly for 12 weeks indicated that chlorpyrifos rapidly sorbed to sediment and plant material, with approximately 47-65% of measured chlorpyrifos mass retained within the first 30 36 m of wetland mesocosms. Of the measured mass, approximately 55% and 25% were retained by sediments and plants, respectively. A field-scale evaluation of a constructed wetland's mitigation capability was performed in the Lourens River watershed of Cape Town, South Africa, Results indicate that the wetland was able to retain and considerably decrease the concentration (and hence toxicity) of chlorpyrifos and suspended sediment entering the receiving waterbody (Lourens River), This research provides fundamental answers concerning constructed wetland capabilities that are necessary for constructing field-scale systems within agricultural watersheds.

AB  - The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of deltamethrin on biomarkers and behavior of Palaemon serratus (common prawn), since this attempt to link different levels of biological organization will allow determining which biomarkers might be ecologically relevant and will be useful to complement the information about the effects of pesticides by using behavioral parameters. Therefore, parameters of liver antioxidant status, energy metabolism and neurotransmission were determined in different tissues of the common prawn and used to assess the effects at sub-individual level, whereas swimming velocity was used to assess the effects at the individual level. It was also investigated if the swimming velocity can be used as an endpoint in ecotoxicology bioassays and if it can be as sensitive as biomarker endpoints.
   Swimming velocity was significantly reduced in prawns exposed to deltamethrin, showing a lowest observed effect (LOEC) of 0.6 ng L-1. Eye acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was significantly increased in prawns exposed to 0.6, 1.2 and 2.4 ng L-1 deltamethrin, whereas muscle cholinesterase (ChE) activity was significantly increased in prawns exposed to 19 and 39 ng L-1. On the other hand, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was significantly increased in muscle of prawns exposed to 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 4.9 ng L-1 deltamethrin, showing that organisms were requiring additional energy, but probably using it for detoxification processes rather than locomotion, since swimming velocity was inhibited. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity was significantly increased in the digestive gland of common prawn exposed to 19 and 39 ng L-1 deltamethrin. Catalase (CAT) activity was significantly increased in digestive gland of prawn exposed to 19 ng L-1 deltamethrin. However, CAT activity decreased in digestive gland of prawn exposed to 39 ng L-1, suggesting an antioxidant defense system failure concomitant with high levels of lipid peroxidation. Thus, global results showed that decreased swimming velocity was not associated with cholinesterase inhibition. In fact, the impairment of swimming velocity may be due to allocation of energy for detoxification and antioxidant protection instead of swimming activity. The present study showed that swimming velocity could be used as an ecologically relevant tool and a sensitive endpoint to assess and complement the study of pesticide effects on marine organisms.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop two behavioral tests (swimming velocity and avoidance behavior) specific for the common prawn, Palaemon serratus, and to investigate the effects of sublethal concentrations of fenitrothion on behavior and on several biomarkers. In a first bioassay, mortality was investigated in prawns exposed during 96 h to concentrations of fenitrothion ranging from 39 to 40000 ng L-1. The effects on swimming velocity and biomarkers were determined in prawns exposed to the sub-lethal concentrations of fenitrothion (from 39 to 625 ng L-1). A specific newly bioassay was developed to assess the capability of prawns to avoid the toxicant (avoidance test). Finally, in order to determine the effects on biomarkers during the avoidance test, prawns were collected at different times of exposure (30, 60, 90 and 120 min). Results showed that prawns exposed to the sub-lethal concentrations of fenitrothion exhibited a significant inhibition of swimming velocity with a LOEC of 313 ng L-1. A significant inhibition of both eye AChE (LOEC = 78 ng L-1) and muscle ChE (LOEC = 156 ng L-1) activities were also observed. Results from the avoidance test indicated that animals significantly avoided fenitrothion (78 ng L-1). However, this capability was not observed in prawns exposed to 156 ng L-1 fenitrothion. Prawns exposed to fenitrothion showed alterations in enzymes involved in the production of energy (LDH and IDH) possibly in an attempt to cope with additional energetic demands. Impairment of locomotion and avoidance may lead to alterations at the population level. Thus, the present behavioral tests can be useful as ecologically relevant tools for ecological risk assessment.

AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the concentrations of carbofuran residues in water, soil and plant samples from selected sites in the farmlands in Kenya and to demonstrate the impact of Furadan use on the local environment. Soil, water and plant samples obtained from agricultural farmlands where the technical formulation Furadan has been used extensively showed high environmental contamination with concentrations of carbofuran and its two toxic metabolites 3-hydroxycarbofuran and 3-ketocarbofuran, separately, ranging from 0.010-1.009 mg/kg of dry surface soil, 0.005-0.495 mg/L in water samples from two rivers flowing through the farms and bdl-2.301 mg/L in water samples from ponds and dams located close to the farms. Maize plant samples contained these residues in concentrations ranging from 0.04-1.328 mg/kg of dry plant tissue. The significantly high concentration levels of carbofuran and its metabolites, 3-ketocarbofuran and 3-hydroxycarbofuran, found in various matrices demonstrate that Furadan was used extensively in the two areas and that there was environmental distribution and exposure of residues in water which posed risks when used for domestic purposes or as drinking water for animals in two wildlife conservancies where the dams and ponds are located. Surface soil contamination was also high and posed risks through run-off into the dams and rivers as well as through secondary exposure to small birds and mammals.

AB  - Canadian Water Quality Guidelines (CWQG) are numerical or narrative limits that protect designated water uses. Development of CWQG is based on review of chromium's properties, uses, fate in the environment, ambient levels, accumulation in biota, and toxicity. Chromium's principal uses and entry into the environment include electroplating, production of paints and pigments, tanning, wood preservation, chromium chemicals production, metal smelting, and pulp and paper production. Concentrations of chromium in Canada range between 1 and 545,000 ng.m(-3) in air, 0.001 and 0.165 mg.L-1 in water, nondetectable and 31,000 mg.kg(-1) in sediments, 10 and 5000 mg.kg(-1) in soils, 0.006 and 18 mg.kg(-1) in plants, and 0.03 and 1.6 mg.kg(-1) in animals. In nature, trivalent chromium sorbs to various ligands and forms insoluble entities becoming unavailable for uptake by biota. Hexavalent chromium forms many soluble salts that can enter body membranes and induce a toxic response. Estimates of toxicity of hexavalent chromium to aquatic life range from 0.0006 mg.L-1 (reduction in algal growth) to 1000 mg.L-1 (decrease in rest time of Chironomus tentans). For trivalent chromium the toxicity ranges from 0.002 mg.L-1 (reduction in filtering rate of Perna perna) to 937 mg.L-1 (48-h LCS50 of Asellus aquaticus). Plants are affected by the concentrations of hexavalent chromium ranging from 0.16 mg.L-1 (growth reduction in lettuce) to 75 mg.L-1 (no effects in sweet orange). For trivalent chromium the toxicity ranges between 0.104 mg.L-1 (reduction in root growth of oats) and 50 mg.L-1 (stunted growth of corn and tomato). Terrestrial animals such as the beagle dog can be affected by concentrations exceeding 62.7 mg.L-1 (CrVI). Mice can tolerate 100 mg.L-1 of hexavalent chromium. Trivalent chromium has adverse effects on rats and mice at 28.0 mg.L-1. For freshwater life, guidelines of 0.001 (Cr VI; full) and 0.008 (Cr III; interim) mg.L-1 are recommended. For marine life, guidelines of 0.001 (Cr VI; draft) and 0.05 (Cr III; interim) mg.L-1 are recommended. Irrigation guidelines are set at 0.008 (Cr VI) and 0.005 (Cr III). A guideline of 0.05 mg.L-1 is recommended for drinking and livestock waters. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - In this study, amphibian tadpoles of Hypsiboas pulchellus were exposed to herbicide Liberty(A (R)), which contains glufosinate ammonium (GLA), for 48 h to the following concentrations: 0 (control), 3.55, 4.74, 6.32, 8.43, 11.25, 15, 20, 26.6, and 35.5 mg GLA L-1. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities, as well as swimming capabilities (swimming speed and mean distance) were measured in tadpoles whose concentrations displayed survival rates > 85 %. Our results reveal that sublethal concentrations of GLA significantly inhibited both AChE and BChE activities in tadpoles with respect to the control, showing a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect. The highest inhibition percentages of AChE (50.86 %) and BChE (53.02 %) were registered in tadpoles exposed to 15 mg GLA L-1. At this concentration, a significant increase of the swimming speed and mean distance were found in exposed tadpoles with respect to the control, as well as a negative and significant correlation between swimming speed and BChE activity, thus suggesting that this enzyme inhibition is related to an increase in swimming speed. Therefore, exposure of tadpoles to GLA in the wild at concentrations similar to those tested here may have adverse consequences at population level because neurotransmission and swimming performance are essential for tadpole performance and survival.

AB  - Endosulfan is a broad spectrum organochlorine pesticide that is still widely in use in many developing countries. Following application, endosulfan can get to watercourses through surface runoff from agricultural fields and disturb the non-target aquatic animals including freshwater fish species. Given that the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of the most recurrently used biomarkers of exposure to pesticides and there are controversial results concerning the effects of endosulfan exposure and AChE activity in fish, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of endosulfan in brain AChE activity and its gene expression pattern using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an animal model. Moreover, we have analyzed the effects of endosulfan exposure in different parameters of zebrafish swimming activity and in long-term memory formation. After 96 h of exposition, fish in the 2.4 mu g endosulfan/L group presented a significant decrease in AChE activity (9.44 +/- 1.038 mu mol SCh h(-1) mg protein(-1): p = 0.0205) when compared to the control group (15.87 +/- 1.768 mu mol SCh h(-1) mg protein(-1); p = 0.0205) which corresponds to approximately 40%. The down-regulation of brain AChE activity is not directly related with the transcriptional control as demonstrated by the RT-qPCR analysis. Our results reinforce AChE activity inhibition as a pathway of endosulfan-induced toxicity in brain of fish species. In addition, exposure to 2.4 mu g endosulfan/L during 96 h impaired all exploratory parameters evaluated: decreased line crossings (approximate to 21%, 273.7 +/- 28.12 number of line crossings compared to the control group 344.6 +/- 21.30, p = 0.0483), traveled distance (approximate to 20%, 23.44 +/- 2.127 m compared to the control group 29.39 +/- 1.585, p = 0.0281), mean speed (approximate to 25%, 0.03 +/- 0.003 m/s compared to the control group 0.04 +/- 0.002, p = 0.0275) and body turn angle (approximate to 21%, 69.940 +/- 4871 absolute turn angle compared to the control group 88.010 +/- 4560, p = 0.0114). These results suggest that endosulfan exposure significantly impairs animals' exploratory performance, and potentially compromises their ecological and interspecific interaction. Our results also showed that the same endosulfan exposure did not compromise animals' performance in the inhibitory avoidance apparatus. These findings provide further evidence of the deleterious effects of endosulfan exposure in the nervous system. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus at 9 days post-hatch were exposed in semi-static experiments to the carbamate insecticide carbofuran, which is applied in agricultural systems in Brazil. Although the molecular mechanism of carbofuran toxicity is well known, a detailed understanding of the ecological mechanisms through which carbofuran effects can propagate towards higher levels of biological organization in fish is incomplete. Mortality rates were quantified for larvae exposed for 96 h to 8.3, 40.6, 69.9, 140, 297 and 397 mu/L carbofuran, and the LC(50) 96 h was 214.7 mu g/L. In addition, the biochemical biomarker cholinesterase inhibition and behavioral biomarkers related to vision, swimming, prey capture and predator avoidance were quantified in individual larvae, as well as their growth in weight. The behavioral parameters were quantified by analysis of digitally recorded videos of individual larvae within appropriate experimental setups. The activity of the enzyme cholinesterase decreased after exposure to carbofuran with a lowest observed effects concentration (LOEC) of 69.9 mu g/L Visual acuity deficits were detected after carbofuran exposure with a LOEC of 40.6 mu g/L Swimming speed decreased with carbofuran exposure, with a LOEC of 397.6 mu g/L The number of attacks to prey (Daphnia magna nauplii) decreased in larvae exposed to carbofuran, with a LOEC of 397.6 mu g/L Growth in weight was significantly reduced in a dose dependent manner, and all carbofuran groups exhibited a statistically significant decrease in growth when compared to controls (p<0.05). The number of predator attacks necessary to capture larvae decreased after exposure to carbofuran, and the LOEC was 69.9 mu g/L These results show that exposure of sensitive early life stages of tilapia O. niloticus to sublethal concentrations of carbofuran can affect fundamental aspects of fish larval ecology that are relevant to recruitment of fish populations, and that can be better understood by the application of behavioral biomarkers.

TI  - Changes in behavior and brain acetylcholinesterase activity in mosquito fish, Gambusia affinis in response to the sub-lethal exposure to chlorpyrifos.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
LA  - English
AB  - Sub-lethal studies of chlorpyrifos, O,O-diethyl-O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl) phosphorothioate on mosquito fish, Gambusia affinis were carried out in vivo, for 20 days to assess the locomotor behavior in relation to bioaccumulation and interaction with a targeted enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC: 3.1.1.7). Fish exposed to sub-lethal concentration of 60 microg/L (1/5 of LC 50) were under stress, and reduced their locomotor behavior like distance travelled per unit time (m/min) and swimming speed (cm/sec) with respect to the length of exposure. The alteration in locomotor behavior of fish may be due to an accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter at synaptic junctions, due to the inhibition of AChE enzyme activity (40 to 55%) in brain and also bioaccumulation of the toxicant in different parts of fish. The bioaccumulation values indicated that the accumulation of chlorpyrifos was maximum in viscera followed by head and body. The average bio-concentration values are 0.109, 0.009 and 0.004 microg/g for viscera, head and body with depuration rates of 2.24, 1.69 and 0.39 ng/h respectively. It is evident from the results that the sub-lethal concentration [1/5 of LC 50; equivalent to Lowest Observed Effect Concentration (LOEC)] of chlorpyrifos can able to alter the locomotor behavior of G. affinis in relation to the length of exposure. The findings revealed that the locomotor activity of test organism could be considered as a suitable marker to evaluate the affect of toxicant even at LOEC levels.

AB  - Subacute studies of monocrotophos [Dimethyl (E)-l-methyl-2-(methyl-carbamoyl) vinyl phosphate] on mosquito fish, Gambusia affinis, were carried out in vivo for 24 days to assess the locomotor behavior, structural integrity of gill, and targeted enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC: 3.1.1.7) interactions. Monocrotophos (MCP) can be rated as moderately toxic to G. affinis, with a median lethal concentration (LC50) of 20.49 +/- 2.45 mgL(-1). The fish exposed to sublethal concentration of LC10 (7.74 mgL(-1)) were under stress and altered their locomotor behavior, such as distance traveled per unit time (m min(-1)) and swimming speed (cm sec(-1)) with respect to the length of exposure. Inhibition in the activity of brain AChE and deformities in the primary and secondary lamellae of gill may have resulted in failure of exchange of gases. The maximum inhibition of 95% of AChE activity was observed on days 20 and 24. Morphological aberrations in the gills were also studied during exposure to the sublethal concentration of monocrotophos for a period ranging from 8 to 24 days. The extent of damage in gill was dependent on the duration of exposure. The findings revealed that inhibition in brain AChE activity and structural alteration in gill were responsible for altering the locomotor behavior of exposed fish.

AB  - Global declines in amphibians likely have multiple causes, including widespread pesticide use. Our knowledge of pesticide effects on amphibians is largely limited to short-term (4-d) toxicity tests conducted under highly artificial conditions to determine lethal concentrations (LC50). We found that if we used slightly longer exposure times (10-16 d), low concentrations of the pesticide carbaryl (3-4% of LC50(4-d)) killed 10-60% of gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) tadpoles. If predatory cues also were present, the pesticide became 2-4 times more lethal, killing 60-98% of tadpoles. Thus, under more realistic conditions of increased exposure times and predatory stress, current application rates for carbaryl can potentially devastate gray treefrog populations. Further, because predator-induced stress is ubiquitous in animals and carbaryl's mode of action is common to many pesticides, these negative impacts may be widespread in nature.

AB  - The field of toxicology has traditionally assessed the risk of contaminants by using laboratory experiments and a range of pesticide concentrations that are held constant for short periods of time (1-4 days). From these experiments, one can estimate the concentration that causes no effect on survival. However, organisms in nature frequently experience multiple applications of pesticides over time rather than a single constant concentration. In addition, organisms are embedded in ecological communities that can propagate indirect effects through a food web. Using outdoor mesocosms, we examined how low concentrations (10-250 mu g/L) of a globally common insecticide (malathion) applied at various amounts, times, and frequencies affected aquatic communities containing zooplankton, phytoplankton, periphyton, and larval amphibians (reared at two densities) for 79 days. All application regimes caused a decline in zooplankton, which initiated a trophic cascade in which there was a bloom in phytoplankton and, in several treatments, a subsequent decline in the competing periphyton. The reduced periphyton had little effect on wood frogs (Rana sylvatica), which have a short time to metamorphosis. However, leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) have a longer time to metamorphosis, and they experienced large reductions in growth and development, which led to subsequent mortality as the environment dried. Hence, malathion (which rapidly breaks down) did not directly kill amphibians, but initiated a trophic cascade that indirectly resulted in substantial amphibian mortality. Importantly, repeated applications of the lowest concentration (a "press treatment'' consisting of seven weekly applications of 10 mu g/L) caused larger impacts on many of the response variables than single "pulse'' applications that were 25 times as great in concentration. These results are not only important because malathion is the most commonly applied insecticide and is found in wetlands, but also because the mechanism underlying the trophic cascade is common to a wide range of insecticides, offering the possibility of general predictions for the way in which many insecticides impact aquatic communities and the populations of larval amphibians.

AB  - Organophosphates, a type of neurotoxicant pesticide, are used globally for the treatment of pests on croplands and are therefore found in a large number of conventional foods. These pesticides are harmful and potentially deadly if ingested or inhaled in large quantities by causing a significant reduction in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the central and peripheral nervous system. However, much less is known about the effects of exposure to small quantities of the pesticides on neural systems and behavior during development. In the current study we used zebrafish larvae in order to determine the effects of two of the most widely used organophosphates, chlorpyrifos and malathion, on zebrafish behavior and AChE activity. Embryos and larvae were exposed to the organophosphates during different time points in development and then tested at 5 days post-fertilization for behavioral, neurodevelopmental and AChE abnormalities. The results of the study indicate that chlorpyrifos and malathion cause opposing behaviors in the larvae such as swim speed (hypoactivity vs. hyperactivity) and rest. Additionally, the pesticides affect only certain behaviors, such as thigmotaxis, during specific time points in development that are unrelated to changes in AChE activity. Larvae treated with malathion but not chlorpyrifos also had significantly smaller forebrain and hindbrain regions compared to controls by 5 days postfertilization. We conclude that exposure to very low concentrations of organophosphate pesticides during development cause abnormalities in behavior and brain size. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neurobehavioral disorders such as anxiety, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders are typically influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Although several genetic risk factors have been identified in recent years, little is known about the environmental factors that either cause neurobehavioral disorders or contribute to their progression in genetically predisposed individuals. One environmental factor that has raised concerns is chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide that is widely used in agriculture and is found ubiquitously in the environment. In the present study, we examined the effects of sub-chronic chlorpyrifos exposure on anxiety-related behavior during development using zebrafish larvae. We found that sub-chronic exposure to 0.01 or 0.1 mu M chlorpyrifos during development induces specific behavioral defects in 7-day-old zebrafish larvae. The larvae displayed decreases in swim speed and thigmotaxis, yet no changes in avoidance behavior were seen. Exposure to 0.001 mu M chlorpyrifos did not affect swimming, thigmotaxis, or avoidance behavior and exposure to 1 mu M chlorpyrifos induced behavioral defects, but also induced defects in larval morphology. Since thigmotaxis, a preference for the edge, is an anxiety-related behavior in zebrafish larvae, we propose that sub-chronic chlorpyrifos exposure interferes with the development of anxiety-related behaviors. The results of this study provide a good starting point for examination of the molecular, cellular, developmental, and neural mechanisms that are affected by environmentally relevant concentrations of organophosphate pesticides. A more detailed understanding of these mechanisms is important for the development of predictive models and refined health policies to prevent toxicant-induced neurobehavioral disorders.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos is a common organophosphate insecticide that has been widely detected in surface waters that provide habitat for Pacific salmon in the western United States. Although chlorpyrifos is known to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the brain and muscle of salmonids, the relationship between sublethal AChE inhibition and more integrative indicators of neuro-behavioral impairment are poorly understood. This is particularly true for exposures that reflect the typical range of pesticide concentrations in the aquatic environment. To directly compare the effects of chlorpyrifos on AChE activity and salmon behavior, we exposed juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kistitch) to chlorpyrifos (0-2.5 mug/L) for 96 h. A computer-assisted, three-dimensional video imaging system was used to measure spontaneous swimming and feeding behaviors in control and chlorpyrifos-exposed fish. After the behavioral trials, brain and muscle tissues were collected and analyzed for AChE activity. Chlorpyrifos inhibited tissue AChE activity and all behaviors in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, brain AChE inhibition and reductions in spontaneous swimming and feeding activity were significantly correlated. Benchmark concentrations for sublethal neurotoxicity (statistical departure values) were <0.5 mug/L and were similar for both neurochemical and behavioral endpoints. Collectively, these results indicate a close relationship between brain AChE inhibition and behavioral impairment in juvenile coho exposed to chlorpyrifos at environmentally realistic concentrations.

AB  - This book chapter gives an overview of synthetic pyrethroids in agricultural surface waters with particular emphasis on the aspects of exposure, effects and risk mitigation. Exposure from agricultural sources is largely short-term in nature and edge-of-field runoff appears to be a rather important source of entry for both aqueous-phase and particle-associated compounds. Concentrations of pyrethroids detected vary between a few nanograms in water up to several hundred micrograms in sediments or suspended particles. Three case studies on pyrethroid effects are included. Interspecific (predation) and intraspecific (cannibalism) interactions increased the susceptibility of model communities to pulse exposure with fenvalerate in artificial stream microcosms. Another stream microcosm study with cypermethrin that simulated agricultural runoff conditions with elevated turbidity levels indicated the importance of reduced bioavailability under field conditions in which there is naturally more suspended and dissolved material than in controlled laboratory studies. This study also suggested the behavioural reactions of mayfly nymphs as important, i.e. nymphs exposed to higher flow rates reduced their pyrethroid exposure by a flow avoidance behaviour. A third study used in situ bioassays with the amphipod species Gammarus pulex in a stream system receiving transient fenvalerate runoff. Here, an avoidance reaction was evident in that the amphipods actively migrated from a site contaminated with fenvalerate into an uncontaminated tributary during the runoff event. Hence, under field conditions, avoidance reactions of mobile non-target organisms appear to be a relevant process which, if not considered, may lead to overestimation of real-world toxicity e.g. in in situ studies while there may be no manifest responses at the in-stream population level. Due to the relatively low water solubility of pyrethroids, in stream mitigation measures using aquatic plants such as vegetated ditches or constructed wetlands appear to be a valuable management tool. A case study is presented below, which demonstrates that 300-m stretches of vegetated ditches effectively mitigated concentrations of 666 mu g/L bifenthrin or 375 mu g/L lambda-cyhalothrin experimentally-added to simulate a storm runoff event. It may be concluded, that by incorporating vegetated drainage ditches or constructed wetlands into a watershed management program for pyrethroids, that agriculture can continue to decrease the potential impact of nonpoint-sources to downstream aquatic receiving systems.

AB  - Pesticides represent an important threat for natural populations. While their effects are assessed on short terms acute exposure, some of their harmful consequences may only become apparent when combined with other stressors, notably natural ones, such as predation. Here, we investigated in a laboratory experiment how exposure to a common fungicide (fenpropimorph) would affect the responses to predation in the common frog Rana temporaria, The concentrations of fungicide we used were comparable to those found in nature (0, 2, or 11 mu g/L). The higher concentration of fungicide reduced tadpole activity late in the experiment, and only 7% of the tadpoles reached metamorphosis. In the lower concentration, the ability to respond adaptively to predator presence was not affected, but the costs (delayed metamorphosis, smaller relative body size) of this response were increased. Our results highlight the need to investigate sublethal effects of pesticides on organismal performance if assessment of pesticides real impact is to be obtained.

AB  - While physiological biomarkers exist to verify exposure of amphibians in natural populations to agricultural chemicals, the ecological relevance of changes in these parameters is often difficult to determine. We compare the relationship between tadpole cholinesterase (ChE; a common enzymatic biomarker of exposure to OP pesticides) and measures of size and swim speed in four native North American species of anurans (Hyla chrysoscelis, Rana sphenocephala, Acris crepitans, and Gastrophryne olivacea). We used four environmentally realistic levels (1, 10, 100 and 200 mu g/l) of a commonly used organophosphate pesticide (OP), chlorpyrifos, and examined tadpole response at the conclusion of 4 days of exposure. We further examined if the presence or absence of pond sediment influenced tadpole responses, and, in two species, we determined how a 12-day exposure influenced responses. We found species-specific differences in response to the pesticide, with H. chrsysoscelis and G. olivacea being most sensitive; however, the levels of inhibition of ChE activity were generally not sufficient to exert an effect on swim speed as we measured it. Generally, tadpole mass was reduced 20-35% in the highest concentration after 4 days of exposure. We found the presence of sediment to influence these responses, although the effects were not consistent among species. Given these differences in ecologically relevant responses, we recommend exercising caution when making generalizations across different anuran amphibian taxa regarding responses to pesticide exposure.

AB  - Because habitats are increasingly exposed to multiple stressors simultaneously, assessing the interactive effects of stressors is crucial for understanding how populations respond to human-altered habitats. Salinization of freshwater habitats is increasing and has the potential to interact with other stressors. Chemical pollutants also contribute to habitat degradation in freshwater environments, and both salinity and various pesticides can harm amphibians. The present study used a factorial experiment to investigate the effect of elevated salinity alone and in combination with each of 3 pesticidesatrazine, carbaryl, and glyphosateon life history and behavior of southern toad larvae (Anaxyrus terrestris). Tadpoles were negatively affected by elevated salinity and by exposure to the insecticide carbaryl, with the most deleterious outcomes associated with both stressors combined. Carbaryl exposure led to reduced survival as well as sublethal effects on growth, activity and feeding behavior, escape response swimming, and time to metamorphosis. Tadpoles reared at elevated salinity were also smaller and less active, and ultimately metamorphosed later and at smaller size. Together, carbaryl and elevated salinity had a synergistic effect, resulting in particularly poor growth, depressed activity and feeding, and sluggish escape swimming among tadpoles exposed to both stressors simultaneously. These results suggest that both elevated salinity and carbaryl represent threats for amphibian populations and that pesticide exposure in salinized habitats may pose a particularly high risk.

AB  - Atrazine (ATR) and chlorpyrifos (CPF) are widely used pesticides in agricultural practices throughout world. It has resulted in a series of toxicological and environmental problems, such as impacts on many non-target aquatic species, including fish. The spleen and head kidney in the bony fish are the major hematopoietic organs, and play a crucial part in immune responses. This study evaluated the subchronic effects of ATR and CPF on the mRNA and protein levels of HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90 in the immune organs of common carp and compared the acute and subchronic effects of ATR and CPF on the swimming speed (SS) of common carp. The results of acute toxicity tests showed that the 96 h-LC50 of AIR and CPF for common carp was determined to be 2.142 and 0.582 mg/L, respectively. Meanwhile, acute and subacute toxicity of ATR and CPF in common carp resulted in hypoactivity. We also found that the mRNA and protein levels of HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90 genes were induced in the spleen and head kidney of common carp exposed to ATR and CPF in the subchronic toxicity test. Our results indicate that ATR and CPF are highly toxic to common carp, and hypoactivity in common carp by acute and subchronic toxicity of ATR and CPF may provide a useful tool for assessing the toxicity of triazine herbicide and organophosphorous pesticides to aquatic organisms. In addition, the results from the subchronic toxicity test exhibited that increasing concentration of AIR and CPF in the environment causes considerable stress for common carp, suggesting that AIR and CPF exposure cause immunotoxicity to common carp.
