Although the mixed success of organic farming in enhancing biodiversity has been attributed to differences in taxa and landscape context, no studies have focused on the effect of macro-scale factors such as climate and topography. This study provides the first assessment of the impact of macro-scale factors on the effectiveness of within-farm management on biodiversity, using spiders in Japan as an example. A multilevel modelling approach revealed that reducing pesticide applications increases spider abundance, particularly in areas with high precipitation, which were also associated with high potential spider abundance. Using the model we identified areas throughout Japan that can potentially benefit from organic farming. The alteration of local habitat-abundance relations by macro-scale factors could explain the reported low spatial generality in the effects of organic farming and patterns of habitat association.","[Amano, Tatsuya; Kusumoto, Yoshinobu; Baba, Yuki G.; Hamasaki, Kenji; Tanaka, Koichi; Yamamoto, Shori] Natl Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Biodivers Div, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; [Amano, Tatsuya] Univ Tokyo, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Lab Biodivers Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Okamura, Hiroshi] Fisheries Res Agcy, Natl Res Inst Far Seas Fisheries, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2368648, Japan",National Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences (NIAES) Japan; University of Tokyo; Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA),"Amano, T (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Conservat Sci Grp, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",amatatsu830@gmail.com,"Okamura, Hiroshi/AAV-4162-2021; Amano, Tatsuya/E-7367-2010; OKAMURA, HIROSHI/AAS-2637-2021","Amano, Tatsuya/0000-0001-6576-3410; Baba, Yuki/0000-0003-1742-6916","Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan [3111]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21580241] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan(Ministry of Agriculture Forestry & Fisheries - Japan); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was based on the project 'Selection of functional biodiversity indicators and development of assessment methods' (3111), supported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan.

The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to pesticides increases the susceptibility of hares to F. tularensis and modulates the course of the infection. METHODS: Experimental hares were allocated to a) control, b) paraoxon-treated, c) F tularensis-treated, and d) paraoxon-and-F. tularensis-treated groups of five specimens on a random basis and subcutaneously inoculated with a wild F. tularensis subsp. holarctica strain (a single dose of 9 x 10(8) CFU pro toto) and/or injected a sublethal dose of paraoxon (100 mu g/kg). Group differences were evaluated using survival curves, oxidative stress responses as well as caspase-3 and acetylcholinesterase activities in whole blood samples collected on day 2 post exposure. RESULTS: The paraoxon-and-F. tularensis-treated group showed a rapid onset of clinical signs and all deaths occurred on days 2 and 3 post exposure. F. tularensis-inoculated hares survived from 3 to 10 days, while only one hare died on day 12 in the paraoxon-treated group. Survival curves in the three exposed groups were significantly different from the control and median survival in F. tularensis-inoculated and paraoxon-and-F. tularensis-treated hares amounted to 7 and 2 days, respectively. Compared with controls, significant responses included an eight- and seven-fold activation of caspase-3 in E tularensis-inoculated and paraoxon-and-F. tularensis-treated hares, respectively, and a 1.5-fold decrease of blood acetylcholinesterase activities in the paraoxon-treated and paraoxon-and-F. tularensis-treated groups. There was a 1.3- to 1.4-fold decrease of the ferric reducing antioxidant power in blood of F. tularensis-inoculated hares and the paraoxon- and-F. tularensis-treated group, respectively. The blood lipid peroxidation levels were of no differences among the four experimental groups. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study can help understand the pathogenesis of tularemia and mortality of hares in agricultural habitats. Use of anticholinesterase agents in agriculture can pose a threat of infectious disease outbreaks and higher mortality in wildlife populations.","[Bandouchova, Hana; Kral, Jiri; Ondracek, Karel; Osickova, Jitka; Damkova, Veronika; Vitula, Frantisek; Pikula, Jiri] Univ Vet & Pharmaceut Sci Brno, Fac Vet Hyg & Ecol, Dept Vet Ecol & Environm Protect, Brno 61242, Czech Republic; [Pohanka, Miroslav] Univ Def, Fac Mil Hlth Sci, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Treml, Frantisek] Univ Vet & Pharmaceut Sci Brno, Fac Vet Med, Dept Infect Dis & Microbiol, Brno 61242, Czech Republic",University of Veterinary Sciences Brno; University of Defence - Czech Republic; University of Veterinary Sciences Brno,"Pikula, J (corresponding author), Univ Vet & Pharmaceut Sci Brno, Fac Vet Hyg & Ecol, Dept Vet Ecol & Environm Protect, Palackeho 1-3, Brno 61242, Czech Republic.",pikulaj@vfu.cz,"Pohanka, Miroslav/D-7607-2012; Bandouchova, Hana/AAI-1213-2020; Pikula, Jiri/V-8620-2018","Pohanka, Miroslav/0000-0001-8804-8356; Pikula, Jiri/0000-0001-8747-9365; Bandouchova, Hana/0000-0003-0373-7940","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (Czech Republic); Internal Grant Agency of the University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno [MSM 6215712402, 78/2010/FVHE]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (Czech Republic)(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech RepublicCzech Republic Government); Internal Grant Agency of the University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno","The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (Czech Republic) and the Internal Grant Agency of the University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno supported projects MSM 6215712402 and 78/2010/FVHE, respectively.",,43,14,14,0,15,MAGHIRA & MAAS PUBLICATIONS,MUNSBACH,"MAGHIRA & MAAS S A R L, 6C, RUE GABRIEL LIPPMANN, L-5365 MUNSBACH, LUXEMBOURG",0172-780X,2354-4716,,NEUROENDOCRINOL LETT,Neuroendocrinol.

The Central Science Laboratory (CSL) has contributed to WIIS by providing the required laboratory skills for the determination of bee diseases and the expert analytical experience necessary to determine low-level pesticide residues and interpret these results. The results from WIIS form part of the pesticide regulatory process coordinated by the Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) and are published each year. This paper has reviewed the data from WIIS over the 10 year period from 1994 to 2003. The overall trend is that suspected poisoning incidents, reported by beekeepers and the general public, have declined from 56 incidents per year to 23 incidents per year. The number of these incidents that have been attributed to pesticide poisoning has also declined, from 25 incidents to five incidents per year. The possible reasons for these changes and the circumstances involved in the bee poisoning incidents are discussed. However, the source of the pesticide in bee poisoning incidents is often uncertain and the likely cause of these incidents and any trends over time are also discussed. (C) Crown copyright 2007.

Insecticides may elicit lethal and sublethal effects of different natures that may affect various biological systems of the honey bee. The first step in the induction of toxicity by a chemical is the interaction between the toxic compound and its molecular target. The action on the molecular target can lead to the induction of observable or non-visible effects. The toxic substance may impair important processes involved in cognitive functions, behaviour or integrity of physiological functions. This review is focused on the neural effects of insecticides that have repercussions on (a) cognitive functions, including learning and memory, habituation, olfaction and gustation, navigation and orientation; (b) behaviour, including foraging and (c) physiological functions, including thermoregulation and muscle activity.","[Belzunces, Luc P.; Tchamitchian, Sylvie; Brunet, Jean-Luc] INRA, Lab Toxicol Environm, UR Abeilles & Environm 406, F-84000 Avignon, France",INRAE,"Belzunces, LP (corresponding author), INRA, Lab Toxicol Environm, UR Abeilles & Environm 406, Site Agroparc, F-84000 Avignon, France.",luc.belzunces@avignon.inra.fr,"BRUNET, Jean-Luc/ABE-9178-2021; , Belzunces/P-7061-2019","BRUNET, Jean-Luc/0000-0002-3827-1135; , Belzunces/0000-0003-1798-9962; Tchamitchian, Marc/0000-0002-9251-2403",,,,,237,127,145,13,243,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",0044-8435,1297-9678,,APIDOLOGIE,Apidologie,MAY,2012,43,3,,,,,348,370,,10.1007/s13592-012-0134-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13592-012-0134-0,,,23,Entomology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Entomology,958MX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000305243700009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Following the worldwide adoption of spinosad-based products for integrated and organic farming, an increasing number of ecotoxicological studies have been published in the past 10 years. These studies are primarily related to the risk assessment of spinosad towards beneficial arthropods. This review takes into account recent data with the aim of (i) highlighting potentially adverse effects of spinosyns on beneficial arthropods (and hence on ecosystem services that they provide in agroecosystems), (ii) clarifying the range of methods used to address spinosyn side effects on biocontrol agents and pollinators in order to provide new insights for the development of more accurate bioassays, (iii) identifying pitfalls when analysing laboratory results to assess field risks and (iv) gaining increasing knowledge on side effects when using spinosad for integrated pest management (IPM) programmes and organic farming. For the first time, a thorough review of possible risks of spinosad and novel spinosyns (such as spinetoram) to beneficial arthropods (notably natural enemies and pollinators) is provided. The acute lethal effect and multiple sublethal effects have been identified in almost all arthropod groups studied. This review will help to optimise the future use of spinosad and new spinosyns in IPM programmes and for organic farming, notably by preventing the possible side effects of spinosyns on beneficial arthropods.

This review summarizes, for the first time, 15 years of research on the hazards of neonicotinoids to bees including honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees. The focus of the paper is on three different key aspects determining the risks of neonicotinoid field concentrations for bee populations: (1) the environmental neonicotinoid residue levels in plants, bees and bee products in relation to pesticide application, (2) the reported side-effects with special attention for sublethal effects, and (3) the usefulness for the evaluation of neonicotinoids of an already existing risk assessment scheme for systemic compounds. Although environmental residue levels of neonicotinoids were found to be lower than acute/chronic toxicity levels, there is still a lack of reliable data as most analyses were conducted near the detection limit and for only few crops. Many laboratory studies described lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on the foraging behavior, and learning and memory abilities of bees, while no effects were observed in field studies at field-realistic dosages. The proposed risk assessment scheme for systemic compounds was shown to be applicable to assess the risk for side-effects of neonicotinoids as it considers the effect on different life stages and different levels of biological organization (organism versus colony).

The commercial glyphosate-based herbicide Accord is approved for use in wetlands and ponds because it is designed to be safer to aquatic wildlife than other herbicide formulations (e.g., Roundup or Atrazine); however, field experiments are needed to determine whether there are direct, indirect, or sublethal effects on amphibians or effects on wetland community structure. We conducted a replicated field experiment in constructed ponds to test for both the effects of Accord and predator (Tiger Salamanders, Ambystoma tigrinum) density on amphibians and aquatic invertebrates. Herbicide treatment had significant density-dependent effects on Tiger Salamander growth, development, and survival. The survival of anurans and aquatic invertebrates was also affected by herbicide treatment and predator density. At certain Tiger Salamander densities, the community structure was altered such that some species became more common with herbicide treatment, whereas others became less common. Behavior assays of salamander larvae suggest that herbicide treatment alters predator-prey relationships in the experimental pond communities. These results suggest that competition and predation may mediate indirect effects of this herbicide on the aquatic fauna. We conclude that exposure to Accord poses less of a risk to the ecology of amphibians than do other formulations of glyphosate-based herbicides.","[Brodman, Robert; Newman, W.

It is well known that natural environmental chemicals can cause goiter or thyroid imbalance. However, the effects of synthetic chemicals on thyroid function have received little attention, and there is much controversy over their potential clinical impact, because few studies have been conducted in humans. This article reviews the literature on possible thyroid disruption in wildlife, humans, and experimental animals and focuses on the most studied chemicals: the pesticides DDT, amitrole, and the thiocarbamate family, including ethylenethiourea, and the industrial chemicals polyhalogenated hydrocarbons, phenol derivatives, and phthalates. Wildlife observations in polluted areas clearly demonstrate a significant incidence of goiter and/or thyroid imbalance in several species. Experimental evidence in rodents, fish, and primates confirms the potentiality for thyroid disruption of several chemicals and illustrates the mechanisms involved. In adult humans, however, exposure to background levels of chemicals does not seem to have a significant negative effect on thyroid function, while exposure at higher levels, occupational or accidental, may produce mild thyroid changes. The impact of transgenerational, background exposure ill utero on fetal neurodevelopment and later childhood cognitive function is now under scrutiny. There are several studies linking a lack of optimal neurological function in infants and children with high background levels of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and/or co-contaminants, but it is unclear if the effects are caused by thyroid disruption in utero or direct neurotoxicity.","World Wildlife Fund, Wildlife & Contaminants Program, Washington, DC 20037 USA",World Wildlife Fund,"Brucker-Davis, F (corresponding author), World Wildlife Fund, Wildlife & Contaminants Program, 1250 24th St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",,,,,,,,362,372,405,1,92,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1050-7256,1557-9077,,THYROID,Thyroid,SEP,1998,8,9,,,,,827,856,,10.1089/thy.1998.8.827,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/thy.1998.8.827,,,30,Endocrinology & Metabolism,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Endocrinology & Metabolism,124UC,9777756,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000076199600015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Effects of pesticides on terrestrial life stages of amphibians such as juvenile and adult frogs, toads and newts are little understood and a specific risk assessment for pesticide exposure, mandatory for other vertebrate groups, is currently not conducted. We studied the effects of seven pesticide products on juvenile European common frogs (Rana temporaria) in an agricultural overspray scenario. Mortality ranged from 100% after one hour to 40% after seven days at the recommended label rate of currently registered products. The demonstrated toxicity is alarming and a large-scale negative effect of terrestrial pesticide exposure on amphibian populations seems likely. Terrestrial pesticide exposure might be underestimated as a driver of their decline calling for more attention in conservation efforts and the risk assessment procedures in place do not protect this vanishing animal group.","[Bruehl, Carsten A.; Alscher, Annika] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, D-76829 Landau, Germany; [Schmidt, Thomas] Harlan Labs Ltd, CH-4452 Itingen, Switzerland; [Pieper, Silvia] Fed Environm Agcy, D-06844 Dessau, Germany; [Alscher, Annika] Innovat Environm Serv IES Ltd, CH-4108 Witterswil, Switzerland",University of Koblenz & Landau,"Brühl, CA (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, Campus Landau,Fortstr 7, D-76829 Landau, Germany.",bruehl@uni-landau.de,"Bruhl, Carsten A/F-3385-2012; Schmidt, Thomas/ABE-9991-2020","Bruhl, Carsten A./0000-0003-1332-535X; Pieper, Silvia/0000-0003-3844-876X","Federal Environment Agency (UBA), Germany [FKZ 3709 65 421]","Federal Environment Agency (UBA), Germany(University of Buenos Aires)","We would like to thank Thomas Eltz, Susan.

There is a clear philosophy a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a savvy prior on models that is a function of sample Size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used.

For example, aboveground. oral visitors provide pollination services, while belowground arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhance nutrient capture. Traditionally in ecology, these processes were studied in isolation, reinforcing the prevailing assumption that these above- and belowground processes were also functionally distinct. More recently, there has been a growing realization that the soil surface is not a barrier to many ecological interactions, particularly those involving plants (who live simultaneously above and below ground). Because of the potentially large impact that mycorrhizae and. oral visitors can have on plant performance and community dynamics, we designed an experiment to test whether these multi-species mutualisms were interdependent under field conditions. Using benomyl, a widely used fungicide, we suppressed AMF in a native grassland, measuring plant, fungal, and floral-visitor responses after three years of fungal suppression. AMF suppression caused a shift in the community of. oral visitors from large-bodied bees to small-bodied bees and flies, and reduced the total number of. oral visits per flowering stem 67% across the 23 flowering species found in the plots. Fungal suppression has species-specific effects on. oral visits for the six most common flowering plants in this experiment. Exploratory analyses suggest these results were due to changes in. oral-visitor behavior due to altered patch-level. oral display, rather than through direct effects of AMF suppression on. oral morphology. Our findings indicate that AMF are an important, and overlooked, driver of. oral-visitor community structure with the potential to affect pollination services. These results support the growing body of research indicating that interactions among ecological interactions can be of meaningful effect size under natural field conditions and may influence individual performance, population dynamics, and community structure.","[Cahill, James F., Jr.; Smith, Glen R.; Shore, Bryon H.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Elle, Elizabeth] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",University of Alberta; Simon Fraser University,"Cahill, JF (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",jc.cahill@ualberta.ca,"Cahill, James F/B-6147-2015","Cahill, James F/0000-0002-4110-1516",,,,,51,73,95,8,149,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2008,89,7,,,,,1791,1801,,10.1890/07-0719.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-0719.1,,,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,331JC,18705367,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000258007500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The risk to the developing organism can also stem from direct exposure of the offspring after birth or hatching. In addition, transgenerational exposure can result from the exposure of the mother to a chemical at any time throughout her life before producing offspring due to persistence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in body fat, which is mobilized during egg laying or pregnancy and lactation.

Reptiles are particularly good models for studying endocrine altering compounds due to the fact that different species of reptiles have varying modes of gender determination (genotypic sex determination or temperature-dependent sex determination) and parity modes (oviparity or viviparity). This review focuses both on laboratory and field studies of contaminant-induced endocrine alterations in reptiles. Laboratory studies of oviparous reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination reveal that embryonic exposure to natural hormones and many man-made chemicals (including the ubiquitous PCBs and common herbicides) can permanently alter the functioning of the reproductive system.

Over 1000 incidents were investigated to establish their causes: approved use, misuse or deliberate abuse, and the compounds, species and mode of application involved. It was found that most registered incidents are due to deliberate abuse. Approved use is responsible for only a minor fraction of the incidents, and these are due to particular practices such as use of treated seed, bait or wood preservatives and the spraying of grassland. Hardly any incidents were due to crop-spraying. The reason why so few incidents are registered for normal crop-spraying is discussed: do they not occur, or are the casualties not registered?

Pesticides may affect estuarine microorganisms via spills, runoff, and drift. Both the structure and the function of microbial communities may be impaired by pesticide toxicity. Pesticides may also be metabolized or bioaccumulated by microorganisms. Mechanisms of toxicity vary, depending on the type of pesticide and the microbial species exposed. Herbicides are generally most toxic to phototrophic microorganisms, exhibiting toxicity by disrupting photosynthesis. Atrazine is the most widely used and most extensively studied herbicide. Toxic effects of organophosphate and organochlorine insecticides on microbial species have also been demonstrated, although their mechanisms of toxicity in such nontarget species remain unclear. There is a great deal of variability in the toxicity of even a single pesticide among microbial species. When attempting to predict the toxicity of pesticides in estuarine ecosystems, effects of pesticide mixtures and interactions with nutrients should be considered. The toxicity of pesticides to aquatic microorganisms, especially bacteria and protozoa, is an area of research requiring further study.","US Dept Commerce, NOAA, Natl Ocean Serv, Ctr Coastal Environm Hlth & Biomol Res, Charleston, SC 29412 USA; Colorado Sch Mines, Environm Sci & Engn Div, Golden, CO 80401 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Ocean Service, NOAA; Colorado School of Mines","DeLorenzo, ME (corresponding author), US Dept Commerce, NOAA, Natl Ocean Serv, Ctr Coastal Environm Hlth & Biomol Res, 219 Ft Johnson Rd, Charleston, SC 29412 USA.",marie.delorenzo@noaa.gov,"Carneiro, Fernanda/E-9513-2013","Carneiro, Fernanda/0000-0001-6389-4564",,,,,111,366,425,24,292,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0730-7268,1552-8618,,ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM,Environ.

It is possible to find examples where insecticides have impacted disastrously on all these variables and others where the hazards posed have been (through accident or design) ameliorated. In this review, we examine what can currently be surmised about the direct and indirect long-term, field impacts of insecticides upon the environment. We detail specific examples, describe current insecticide use patterns, consider the contexts within which insecticide use occurs and discuss the role of regulation and legislation in reducing risk. We consider how insecticide use is changing in response to increasing environmental awareness and inevitably, as we discuss the main constraints to insecticide use, we suggest why they cannot easily be discarded.","Rothamsted Res, Plant & Invertebrate Ecol Div, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; Univ Queensland, Sch Intergrat Biol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research; University of Queensland,"Devine, GJ (corresponding author), Rothamsted Res, Plant & Invertebrate Ecol Div, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England.",greg.devine@bbsrc.ac.uk,"Devine, Gregor J/H-1141-2014; Furlong, Michael/A-3314-2013","Devine, Gregor J/0000-0001-6312-0390; Furlong, Michael/0000-0002-1465-8087",,,,,232,185,213,7,144,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-048X,1572-8366,,AGR HUM VALUES,Agric.

Past reviews, using vote-counting methods, have described pollution as one of the major threats faced by amphibians. However, vote-counting methods lack strong statistical power, do not permit one to determine the magnitudes of effects, and do not compare responses among predefined groups. To address these challenges, we conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured the effects of different chemical pollutants (nitrogenous and phosphorous compounds, pesticides, road deicers, heavy metals, and other wastewater contaminants) at environmentally relevant concentrations on amphibian survival, mass, time to hatching, time to metamorphosis, and frequency of abnormalities. The overall effect size of pollutant exposure was a medium decrease in amphibian survival and mass and a large increase in abnormality frequency. This translates to a 14.3% decrease in survival, a 7.5% decrease in mass, and a 535% increase in abnormality frequency across all studies. In contrast, we found no overall effect of pollutants on time to hatching and time to metamorphosis. We also found that effect sizes differed among experimental venues and among types of pollutants, but we only detected weak differences among amphibian families. These results suggest that variation in sensitivity to contaminants is generally independent of phylogeny. Some publication bias (i.e., selective reporting) was detected, but only for mass and the interaction effect size among stressors. We conclude that the overall impact of pollution on amphibians is moderately to largely negative. This implies that pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations pose an important threat to amphibians and may play a role in their present global decline.","[Egea-Serrano, Andres; Torralva, Mar] Univ Murcia, Dept Zool & Antropol Fis, Fac Biol, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Relyea, Rick A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Tejedo, Miguel] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Seville 41092, Spain",University of Murcia; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Biologica de Donana (EBD),"Egea-Serrano, A (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Dept Zool & Antropol Fis, Fac Biol, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",aegea@um.es,"TORRALVA, MAR/R-5545-2019",,"Direccion General de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica (MICINN) [CGL2004-01872/BOS, CGL2009-12767-C02-02]; Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo predoctoral fellowship; National Science Foundation; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1119430] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Direccion General de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica (MICINN); Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo predoctoral fellowship; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"This research was partially funded by project (CGL2004-01872/BOS and CGL2009-12767-C02-02) from Direccion General de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica (MICINN), conceded to Miguel Tejedo.

Previous models estimating the impact on wildlife of chemicals used in agro-ecosystems typically have not included the variety of pathways, including both dermal and oral, by which individuals are exposed. The present model contains four submodels simulating (1) foraging behavior of individual birds, (2) chemical applications to crops, (3) transfers of chemicals among soil, insects, and small mammals, and (4) transfers of chemicals to birds via ingestion and dermal exposure. We demonstrate use of the model by simulating the impacts of a variety of commonly used herbicides, insecticides, growth regulators, and defoliants on western burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) that winter in agricultural landscapes in southern Texas, United States. The model generated reasonable movement patterns for each chemical through soil, water, insects, and rodents, as well as into the owl via consumption and dermal absorption. Sensitivity analysis suggested model predictions were sensitive to uncertainty associated with estimates of chemical half-lives in birds, soil, and prey, sensitive to parameters associated with estimating dermal exposure, and relatively insensitive to uncertainty associated with details of chemical application procedures (timing of application, amount of drift). Nonetheless, the general trends in chemical accumulations and the relative impacts of the various chemicals were robust to these parameter changes. Simulation results suggested that insecticides posed a greater potential risk to owls of both sublethal and lethal effects than do herbicides, defoliants, and growth regulators under crop scenarios typical of southern Texas, and that use of multiple indicators, or endpoints provided a more accurate assessment of risk due to agricultural chemical exposure. The model should prove useful in helping prioritize the chemicals and transfer pathways targeted in future studies and also, as these new data become available, in assessing the relative danger to other birds of exposure to different types of agricultural chemicals.

Depending on their type, dose, and persistence in the environment, they can have impact even on non-target species such as beneficial insects (honeybees) in different ways, including reduction in their survival rate and interference with their reproduction process. Honeybee Apis mellifera is a major pollinator and has substantial economical and ecological values. Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is a mysterious phenomenon in which adult honeybee workers suddenly abandon from their hives, leaving behind food, brood, and queen. It is lately drawing a lot of attention due to pollination crisis as well as global agriculture and medical demands. If the problem of CCD is not resolved soon enough, this could have a major impact on food industry affecting world's economy a big time. Causes of CCD are not known. In this overview, I discuss CCD, biogenic amines-based-pesticides (neonicotinoids and formamidines), and their disruptive effects on biogenic amine signaling causing olfactory dysfunction in honeybees. According to my hypothesis, chronic exposure of biogenic amines-based-pesticides to honeybee foragers in hives and agricultural fields can disrupt neural cholinergic and octopaminergic signaling. Abnormality in biogenic amines-mediated neuronal signaling impairs their olfactory learning and memory, therefore foragers do not return to their hive - a possible cause of CCD. This overview is an attempt to discuss a hypothetical link among biogenic amines-based pesticides, olfactory learning and memory, and CCD. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Sensitive species may be impaired by sublethal effects or decimated by lethality, and this ecological alteration may initiate a trophic cascade or a release from competition that secondarily leads to responses in tolerant species. Contaminants may exert direct effects on keystone facilitator and foundation species, and contaminant-induced changes in nutrient and oxygen dynamics may alter ecosystem function. Thus, populations and communities in nature may be directly and/or indirectly affected by exposure to pollutants. While the direct effects of toxicants usually reduce organism abundance, indirect effects may lead to increased or decreased abundance. Here we review 150 papers that reference indirect toxicant effects in aquatic environments. Studies of accidental contaminant release, chronic contamination and experimental manipulations have identified indirect contaminant effects in pelagic and benthic communities caused by many types of pollutants. Contaminant-induced changes in behavior, competition and predation/grazing rate can alter species abundances or community composition, and enhance, mask or spuriously indicate direct contaminant effects. Trophic cascades were found in 60% of the manipulative studies and, most commonly, primary producers increased in abundance when grazers were selectively eliminated by contaminants. Competitive release may also be common, but is difficult to distinguish from trophic cascades because few experiments are designed to isolate the mechanism(s) causing indirect effects. Indirect contaminant effects may have profound implications in environments with strong trophic cascades such as the freshwater pelagic. In spite of their undesirable environmental influence, contaminants can be useful manipulative tools for the study of trophic and competitive interactions in natural communities.

Poisoning events were classified as confirmed (n = 205) when supported by findings of greater than or equal to50% inhibition of cholinesterase (ChE) activity in brain tissue and the detection of a specific pesticide in the gastrointestinal contents of one or more carcasses. Suspected poisonings (n = 130) were defined as cases where brain ChE activity was greater than or equal to50% inhibited or a specific pesticide was identified in gastrointestinal contents. The 335 avian mortality events occurred in 42 states. Washington, Virginia, and Ohio had the highest frequency of events, with 24 (7.2%), 21 (6.3%), and 20 (6.0%) events, respectively. A total of 8877 carcasses of 103 avian species in 12 orders was recovered. Because carcass counts underestimate total mortality, this represents the minimum actual mortality. Of 24 different pesticides identified, the most frequent were famphur (n = 59; 18%), carbofuran (n = 52; 15%), diazinon (n = 40; 12%), and fenthion (n = 17; 5.1%). Falconiformes were reported killed most frequently (49% of all die-offs) but Anseriformes were found dead in the greatest numbers (64% of 8877 found dead).

Although North America was of special interest for regulatory reasons, the review was extended to western Europe because the most extensive and intensive work has been done there. The half-life of herbicides in the environment ranges from less than 1 month to more than 1 year. Wildlife within fields is most likely to be exposed to herbicides, particularly when fields are planted with crops (e.g. corn, soybean, wheat, cotton) which are routinely sprayed. Wildlife is also likely to be exposed in non-crop habitats adjoining croplands, primarily from direct overspray (especially during aerial application), and drift during and/or volatilisation after application, The most conclusive scientific evidence for direct effects of herbicides on arable weeds, and associated indirect effects on insects and birds exists in the United Kingdom. Evidence for similar effects in North America is primarily circumstantial at present. Little work has been done anywhere on impacts of herbicides on plants and their associated fauna in non-crop habitats adjoining treated fields. Chemical farming (in particular, the use of herbicides) has dramatically altered the habitat pattern of temperate landscapes in North America and western Europe. Strong evidence exists for adverse effects of changes in habitat pattern on beneficial insects and arthropods in the United Kingdom, and on birds in North America and western Europe. Toxicity testing guidelines for nontarget plant protection need to be developed and enforced to support pesticide registration. In addition, research is needed to include more ecologically relevant plant species in laboratory tests, to develop multi-species tests (particularly in the field), to improve methods for risk assessment, and to develop options for mitigating risks. Large scale, long-term trans-disciplinary research of different farming systems is needed, particularly in North America, to integrate and better evaluate ecological, agronomic, and socio-economic costs and benefits of agricultural herbicide use in temperate landscapes.","ENVIRONM CANADA, CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERV, NATL WILDLIFE RES CTR, HULL, PQ K1A 0H3, CANADA",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada,,,,,,,,,262,176,207,3,132,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-8809,1873-2305,,AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON,Agric.

The fundamental features and mechanisms of OP-induced immunotoxicity are illustrated with reference to parathion, chlorpyrifos, malathion, and diazinon. Immunotoxicity may be direct via inhibition of serine hydrolases or esterases in components of the immune system, through oxidative damage to immune organs, or by modulation of signal transduction pathways controlling immune functions. Indirect effects include modulation by the nervous system, or chronic effects of altered metabolism/nutrition on immune organs. Immunotoxicities are varied and include pathology of immune organs, and decreased humoral and/or cell mediated immunity. Altered non-specific immunity, decreased host resistance, hypersensitivity and autoimmunity are also features of immunotoxicity; although not all of these have been conclusively demonstrated in terms of pollutant exposure and immunotoxic effects in wildlife within individual experiments. Immunotoxicological biomarkers and biological monitoring tools are urgently needed to assess the extent of immunotoxicity in wildlife. Selection of universal biomarkers is hampered by the physiological diversity of immune systems in animals. However, by drawing on evidence from human epidemiology and tiered approaches in mammalian immunotoxicity evaluation, a selection of generic biomarkers of immunotoxicity in animals is suggested. Priorities for future research are also identified.","Univ Plymouth, Dept Sci Biol, Plymouth Environm Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Plymouth,"Galloway, T (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Dept Sci Biol, Plymouth Environm Res Ctr, 6 Queen Ann Terrace,Darke Circus, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",tgalloway@plymouth.ac.uk,"Galloway, Tamara/C-1662-2009","Galloway, Tamara/0000-0002-7466-6775",,,,,130,355,397,5,194,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0963-9292,1573-3017,,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Ecotoxicology,FEB-AUG,2003,12,1-4,,,,,345,363,,10.1023/A:1022579416322,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1022579416322,,,19,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,648BB,12739880,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000181129000029,View Full Record in Web of Science

There are numerous examples of links between pollution and increased susceptibility to disease in wildlife species, including immunosuppression in harbour seals feeding on fish from contaminated sites, altered immune function in riverine fish and decreased host resistance in birds exposed to pollutants. Laboratory tests have identified potential immunological hazards posed by a range of anthropogenic chemicals in mammals and higher vertebrates. However, few reports have considered the ecological relevance of pollution-induced immunosuppression in invertebrate phyla, which constitute around 95% of all animal species and occupy key structural and functional roles in ecosystems. In this paper effects of chemicals on immune function in invertebrates are briefly reviewed and biomarkers of immunotoxicity are identified. Examples of new approaches for the measurement of immunological inflammatory reactions and stress in molluscan haemocytes are detailed. The relevance of defining the immune system as a target organ of toxicity in invertebrates is discussed and an integrated approach for the use of immunological biomarkers in environment management is proposed, combining measures of immune function and organismal viability at the biochemical, cellular and population level.","Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Environm Res Ctr Biol Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Plymouth,"Galloway, TS (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Environm Res Ctr Biol Sci, Drake Circus, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",,"Galloway, Tamara/C-1662-2009","Galloway, Tamara/0000-0002-7466-6775; Depledge, Michael/0000-0002-7216-0439",,,,,164,284,309,4,125,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0963-9292,1573-3017,,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Ecotoxicology,FEB,2001,10,1,,,,,5,23,,10.1023/A:1008939520263,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008939520263,,,19,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,395ZX,11227817,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000166612800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Accordingly, the developmental immunotoxic potential of imidacloprid was investigated. Oral exposure was initiated in timed pregnant female Wistar rats on gestation day 6 (GD 6) till GD 21. On GD 20, half of the gravid dams were sacrificed, and in utero fetal development was assessed. In the other half of the dams, administration was continued till weaning on postnatal day 21 (PND 21) and maternal toxicity was investigated. A subgroup of weaned pups was sacrificed to assess immunotoxicity parameters. The other half of the pups were exposed to irnidacloprid till PND 42, and immunotoxicity was assessed. The findings revealed post-implantation loss in the highest dose group, indicating the risk of abortion. Soft tissue abnormalities and skeletal alterations were observed in the highest dose group. Humoral immunity was assessed by estimating hemagglutination titer and immunoglobulin production. Cell mediated immunity was assessed by Delayed Type Hypersensitivity, whereas, non-specific immunity was assessed by phagocytic index, and other phenotypic parameters. These data revealed that imidacloprid caused age-dependent adverse effects on the developing immunity which was aggravated when exposure continued throughout development, leading to a compromised immune system.

Bees contribute approximately 80% of insect pollination, so it is important to understand and mitigate the causes of current declines in bee populations(4-6). Recent studies have implicated the role of pesticides in these declines, as exposure to these chemicals has been associated with changes in bee behaviour(7-11) and reductions in colony queen production(12). However, the key link between changes in individual behaviour and the consequent impact at the colony level has not been shown. Social bee colonies depend on the collective performance of many individual workers. Thus, although field-level pesticide concentrations can have subtle or sublethal effects at the individual level(8), it is not known whether bee societies can buffer such effects or whether it results in a severe cumulative effect at the colony level. Furthermore, widespread agricultural intensification means that bees are exposed to numerous pesticides when foraging(13-15), yet the possible combinatorial effects of pesticide exposure have rarely been investigated(16,17). Here we show that chronic exposure of bumblebees to two pesticides (neonicotinoid and pyrethroid) at concentrations that could approximate field-level exposure impairs natural foraging behaviour and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success. We found that worker foraging performance, particularly pollen collecting efficiency, was significantly reduced with observed knock-on effects for forager recruitment, worker losses and overall worker productivity. Moreover, we provide evidence that combinatorial exposure to pesticides increases the propensity of colonies to fail.","[Gill, Richard J.; Ramos-Rodriguez, Oscar; Raine, Nigel E.] Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Gill, RJ (corresponding author), Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",richard.gill@rhul.ac.uk; nigel.raine@rhul.ac.uk,"Raine, Nigel/AAK-6425-2020","Raine, Nigel/0000-0001-6343-2829; Gill, Richard/0000-0001-9389-1284","Insect Pollinator Initiative; Living with Environmental Change programme, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Wellcome Trust; Scottish Government; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [BB/I000178/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I000178/1] Funding Source: researchfish; BBSRC [BB/I000178/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Insect Pollinator Initiative; Living with Environmental Change programme, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Scottish Government; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC))","We thank M.J.F.

Wildlife observations provide considerable evidence that environmental contaminants can play a critical role in reproductive and developmental dysfunction. Early evidence leading to a widespread awareness of the impact of environmental chemicals on surrounding wildlife was observed in the Laurentian Great Lakes. A suite of reproductive and congenital defects was identified in birds, reptiles, and mammals alike that were attributed to high concentrations of organochlorine pesticides and industrial chemicals. Due to the ubiquitous and persistent nature of many anthropogenic chemicals, these defects, including thyroid dysfunction, hatching success, egg shell thinning, and gross birth deformities, have since been identified in numerous wildlife populations across the world. Certain wildlife taxa such as amphibians are especially vulnerable to chemical perturbation and are suffering alarming population declines. Amphibian field studies have found severe hindlimb and other developmental abnormalities and it has been demonstrated that the greater the agricultural intensity, the greater the number and severity of defects in toad populations. Alligators living in contaminated lakes have shown a significant reduction in penis size and fish exposed to tributyltin have shown tail deformities and abnormal eye development. Physiological and molecular responses to chemical insult are often conserved across vertebrates, alerting scientists and medical professionals alike that greater attention needs to be paid to the roles environmental contaminants play in the etiology of congenital disorders in both humans and wildlife.","[Hamlin, Heather J.; Guillette, Louis J., Jr.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Hamlin, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",hjhamlin@ufl.edu,"Hamlin, Heather/K-6235-2019","Hamlin, Heather/0000-0002-9042-5509","National Institute of Environmental Health [PR471470]; US Environmental Protection Agency [CR 826357-01-1, CR 162460-91-6]",National Institute of Environmental Health; US Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency),Work described here from the Guillette laboratory was funded in part by grants from the National Institute of Environmental Health (PR471470) and US Environmental Protection Agency (CR 826357-01-1 and CR 162460-91-6).

Large zooplankton species, which generally are superior to small zooplankton species in competition, are also more sensitive to insecticides. Relatively low insecticide concentrations, which damage only large taxa (Daphnia), may affect the population dynamics of other zooplankton indirectly through altered competitive relationships. The effects of insecticide on the zooplankton community are also influenced by factors such as temperature, chemical properties (e.g. degradation rate), population trends among the organisms, community structure (presence or absence of predators), and timing of the chemical application. These factors modify interrelationships between organisms and, therefore, control the recovery process of the zooplankton community following insecticide impacts. Results to date suggest that insecticide stress decreases the average size of the organisms, reduces energy transfer efficiency, elongates the food chain and sometimes increases species richness.

As a result, atrazine is the most commonly detected pesticide contaminant of ground, surface, and drinking water. Atrazine is also a potent endocrine disruptor that is active at low, ecologically relevant concentrations. Previous studies showed that atrazine adversely affects amphibian larval development. The present study demonstrates the reproductive consequences of atrazine exposure in adult amphibians. Atrazine-exposed males were both demasculinized (chemically castrated) and completely feminized as adults. Ten percent of the exposed genetic males developed into functional females that copulated with unexposed males and produced viable eggs. Atrazine-exposed males suffered from depressed testosterone, decreased breeding gland size, demasculinized/feminized laryngeal development, suppressed mating behavior, reduced spermatogenesis, and decreased fertility. These data are consistent with effects of atrazine observed in other vertebrate classes. The present findings exemplify the role that atrazine and other endocrine-disrupting pesticides likely play in global amphibian declines.","[Hayes, Tyrone B.; Khoury, Vicky; Narayan, Anne; Nazir, Mariam; Park, Andrew; Brown, Travis; Adame, Lillian; Chan, Elton; Stueve, Theresa; Gallipeau, Sherrie] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lab Integrat Studies Amphibian Biol, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Dept Integrat Biol,Energy Resources Grp,Grp Endoc, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hayes, Tyrone B.; Khoury, Vicky; Narayan, Anne; Nazir, Mariam; Park, Andrew; Brown, Travis; Adame, Lillian; Chan, Elton; Stueve, Theresa; Gallipeau, Sherrie] Univ Calif Berkeley, Mol Toxicol Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Buchholz, Daniel] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Biol Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"Hayes, TB (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lab Integrat Studies Amphibian Biol, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Dept Integrat Biol,Energy Resources Grp,Grp Endoc, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",tyrone@berkeley.edu,,"Stueve, Theresa/0000-0002-0076-4380","Park Water Company; Mitchell Kapor Foundation; David Foundation; Cornell-Douglas Foundation; Wallace Foundation; Class of '43 Endowed Chair; University of California Toxic Substances Research and Teaching Program; National Science Foundation; Hewlett Packard; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; University of California, Berkeley","Park Water Company; Mitchell Kapor Foundation; David Foundation; Cornell-Douglas Foundation; Wallace Foundation; Class of '43 Endowed Chair; University of California Toxic Substances Research and Teaching Program(University of California System); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Hewlett Packard; Howard Hughes Medical Institute(Howard Hughes Medical Institute); University of California, Berkeley(University of California System)","We thank Roger Liu for generating the ZZ colony.

However, organisms in their natural settings rarely experience optimal conditions. On the contrary, during most of their lifetime they are forced to cope with sub-optimal conditions and occasionally with severe environmental stress. Interactions between the effects of a natural stressor and a toxicant can sometimes result in greater effects than expected from either of the stress types alone. The aim of the present review is to provide a synthesis of existing knowledge on the interactions between effects of natural and chemical (anthropogenic) stressors. More than 150 studies were evaluated covering stressors including heat, cold, desiccation, oxygen depletion, pathogens and immunomodulatory factors combined with a variety of environmental pollutants. This evaluation revealed that synergistic interactions between the effects of various natural stressors and toxicants are not uncommon phenomena. Thus, synergistic interactions were reported in more than 50% of the available studies on these interactions. Antagonistic interactions were also detected, but in fewer cases. Interestingly, about 70% of the tested chemicals were found to compromise the immune system of humans as judged from studies on human cell lines. The challenge for future studies will therefore be to include aspects of combined stressors in effect and risk assessment of chemicals in the environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A recent assessment found that nearly one-third (32%, 1,856 species) of the world's amphibian species are threatened. Amphibians have existed on the earth for over 300 million years, yet in just the last two decades there have been an alarming number of extinctions, nearly 168 species are believed to have gone extinct and at least 2,469 (43%) more have populations that are declining. Infectious diseases have been recognized as one major cause of worldwide amphibian population declines. This could be the result of the appearance of novel pathogens, or it could be that exposure to environmental stressors is increasing the susceptibility of amphibians to opportunistic pathogens. Here I review the potential effects of stressors on disease susceptibility in amphibians and relate this to disease emergence in human and other wildlife populations. I will present a series of case studies that illustrate the role of stress in disease outbreaks that have resulted in amphibian declines. First, I will examine how elevated sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific since the mid-1970s have affected climate over much of the world and could be setting the stage for pathogen-mediated amphibian declines in many regions. Finally, I will discuss how the apparently rapid increase in the prevalence of amphibian limb deformities is linked to the synergistic effects of trematode infection and exposure to chemical contaminants.","Nature Conservancy, N Amer Conservat Reg, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA",Nature Conservancy,"Kiesecker, JM (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, N Amer Conservat Reg, 117 E Mt,Suite 201, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA.",jkiesecker@tnc.org,,,National Institutes of Health/National Science Foundation Ecology of Infectious Diseases [1R01ES11067-01]; Nature Conservancy; Research Institute for Humanity and Nature,National Institutes of Health/National Science Foundation Ecology of Infectious Diseases(National Science Foundation (NSF)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Nature Conservancy; Research Institute for Humanity and Nature,"Thanks to Cheri Kiesecker, Mike Rubbo, Ryan Peterson, Gia Vigiano, Sara Storrs, Julian Avery, and Andrew Blaustein for providing technical assistance; and thanks to Mike Rubbo, Lisa Belden, Kat Shea, Billy Costigan, Colin Sullivan, and Frank Costello for discussions that shaped this concept.

We examined influences of soybean agriculture on trematode parasitism of larval amphibians (grey tree frogs; Hyla versicolor) to assess the potential effects of a commonly applied pesticide (glyphosate) and landscape factors relative to previous field studies focusing on the herbicide atrazine. Overall, trematode parasite infection did not differ between soybean-adjacent and nonagricultural ponds (87.7% and 72.6% mean infection, respectively). However, host-generalist echinostome species were more common in tadpoles from soybean-associated ponds (86.3% mean infection versus 36.2% in nonagricultural ponds) as well as sites with large or short average distances to forest cover and roads, respectively. In contrast, the occurrence of a host-specialist (Alaria sp.) group was greater in nonagricultural ponds (50.3% mean infection versus 9.8% in soybean-associated ponds) and increased with shorter distances to the closest forest patch and smaller average forest distance. Because glyphosate was not detected at any site and landscape influences were parasite-specific, we suggest that agriculture may have broad effects on wildlife diseases through habitat alterations that affect pathogen transmission via host habitat suitability. Notably, nonagricultural ponds had a lower mean distance to the nearest forest patch and lower mean forest distance compared with soybean-adjacent ponds. As a result, we emphasize the need for wider investigations of habitat perturbations generally associated with agriculture for host-pathogen interactions, and consequently, wildlife conservation and management strategies.","[Koprivnikar, Janet; Redfern, Julia C.] Brandon Univ, Dept Biol, John R Brodie Sci Ctr, Brandon, MB R7A 6A9, Canada",Brandon University,"Koprivnikar, J (corresponding author), Brandon Univ, Dept Biol, John R Brodie Sci Ctr, 270 18th St, Brandon, MB R7A 6A9, Canada.",koprivnikarj@brandonu.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Brandon University Research Council; NSERC,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Brandon University Research Council; NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"This work was supported by grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and from the Brandon University Research Council to J.K., as well as an NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Assistantship (USRA) to J.C.R.",,59,28,33,1,62,"WILDLIFE DISEASE ASSOC, INC",LAWRENCE,"810 EAST 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0090-3558,1943-3700,,J WILDLIFE DIS,J.

These pesticides inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and thus have potential to interfere with behaviors that may be essential for salmon survival. Although the effects of individual anticholinesterase insecticides on aquatic species have been studied for decades, the neurotoxicity of mixtures is still poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: We assessed whether chemicals in a mixture act in isolation (resulting in additive AChE inhibition) or whether components interact to produce either antagonistic or synergistic toxicity. METHODS: We measured brain AChE inhibition in juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) exposed to sublethal concentrations of the organophosphates diazinon, malathion, and chlorpyrifos, as well as the carbamates carbaryl and carbofuran. Concentrations of individual chemicals were normalized to their respective median effective concentrations (EC50) and collectively fit to a nonlinear regression. We used this curve to determine whether toxicologic responses to binary mixtures were additive, antagonistic, or synergistic. RESULTS: We observed addition and synergism, with a greater degree of synergism at higher exposure concentrations. Several combinations of organophosphates were lethal at concentrations that were sublethal in single-chemical trials. CONCLUSION: Single-chemical risk assessments are likely to underestimate the impacts of these insecticides on salmon in river systems where mixtures occur. Moreover, mixtures of pesticides that have been commonly reported in salmon habitats may pose a more important challenge for species recovery than previously anticipated.","[Laetz, Cathy A.; Baldwin, David H.; Collier, Tracy K.; Scholz, Nathaniel L.] NOAA Fisheries, SW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Hebert, Vincent] Washington State Univ, Food & Environm Qual Lab, Richland, WA USA; [Stark, John D.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Ecotoxicol Program, Puyallup, WA USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Washington State University; Washington State University,"Scholz, NL (corresponding author), NOAA Fisheries, SW Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",nathaniel.scholz@noaa.gov,"Scholz, Nathaniel L/L-1642-2013","Scholz, Nathaniel L/0000-0001-6207-0272",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Protected Resources; Coastal Storms Program,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Protected Resources(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Coastal Storms Program,The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Protected Resources and Coastal Storms Program provided financial support for this research.,,48,221,249,1,152,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

This study presents a new approach for the investigation of predator prey interactions between zebrafish (Danio rerio) and midge larvae (Chironomus riparius) impaired by chlorpyrifos (CHP), a neurotoxic insecticide. With a simple experimental design including four different treatments: (1) control, (2) predator exposed, (3) prey exposed and (4) both, predator and prey, exposed, we were able to detect by visual observation an increase in the feeding rate of zebrafish preying on exposed chironomids after acute (2 h) exposure to 6 mu g/l CHP. Previously, a decrease in the burrowing behaviour of exposed chironomid larvae was observed. However, when pre-exposing simultaneously both predators and prey, no significant differences in the feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. This suggests an impairment in prey recognition of the exposed zebrafish. At a lower CHP concentration (1 mu g/l), no differences in feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. We therefore propose the use of trophic interactions as parameters in higher tier studies for chemical testing and evaluation of ecotoxicological risk assessment.","[Langer-Jaesrich, Miriam; Kienle, Cornelia; Koehler, Heinz-R.] Univ Tubingen, Dept Anim Physiol Ecol, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany; [Gerhardt, Almut] LimCo Int, D-49477 Ibbenburen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Langer-Jaesrich, M (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Dept Anim Physiol Ecol, Konrad Adenauer Str 20, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany.",langermiriam@gmx.de; cornelia.kienle@gmx.de; Heinz-R.Koehler@uni-tuebingen.de; Almutg@web.de,"Köhler, Heinz-R./AAL-1350-2021; Kienle, Cornelia/ABG-5199-2020","Kienle, Cornelia/0000-0002-7695-6549",,,,,53,16,20,1,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0963-9292,1573-3017,,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Ecotoxicology,OCT,2010,19,7,,,,,1294,1301,,10.1007/s10646-010-0516-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-010-0516-x,,,8,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,666HN,20628814,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-03,WOS:000283105500014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Within the Bacteria domain, in addition to the large groups of microorganisms (Alphaprotobacteria, Betaprobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Cytophaga-Flavobacterium), the analysis also involved the presence of bacteria predisposed to degraded pesticides in natural environments: Pseudomonas spp. and Alcaligenes spp. The quantity dynamics of aquatic microorganisms indicated that bacteria and fungi under the influence of long-term exposure to DDT can adapt to the presence of this pesticide in water. No modifying effect of DDT was observed on the quantity of microorganisms or the pattern of seasonal relationships in the eutrophic lake. Changes were shown in the percentage share of large groups of bacteria in the community of microorganisms as was an effect of contamination on the species diversity of fungi.

We reported a man who developed respiratory failure and shock after ingestion of neonicotinoid insecticide. A detailed literature review found that respiratory, cardiovascular and certain neurological presentations are warning signs of severe neonicotinoid intoxication.

In the western US, pesticides have contaminated many surface waters that provide habitat for endangered salmon. These iconic species depend on the productivity of rivers, lakes, and estuaries to provide food for juvenile growth, a key determinant of subsequent marine survival. Despite extensive societal investments in salmon habitat restoration in recent years, the role of pesticides as a limiting factor for salmon recovery has received little attention. Pesticides can be toxic to primary producers and macroinvertebrates, thereby limiting salmon population recovery through adverse, bottom-up impacts on aquatic food webs. The integration of toxicology, environmental chemistry, population biology, community ecology, landscape ecology, conservation biology, and environmental policy is needed to better understand these indirect effects of pesticides on endangered species. We highlight key information gaps and discuss how future research on pesticides and food webs can most effectively guide the long-term conservation of imperiled fish species.","[Macneale, Kate H.; Kiffney, Peter M.; Scholz, Nathaniel L.] NOAA Fisheries, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Ecotoxicol & Environm Fish Hlth Program, Seattle, WA USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Scholz, NL (corresponding author), NOAA Fisheries, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Ecotoxicol & Environm Fish Hlth Program, Seattle, WA USA.",Nathaniel.Scholz@noaa.gov,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009; Scholz, Nathaniel L/L-1642-2013","Scholz, Nathaniel L/0000-0001-6207-0272",,,,,50,54,58,2,109,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1540-9295,1540-9309,,FRONT ECOL ENVIRON,Front.

However, the persistence and health of amphibian populations are likely to be compromised by the escalating use of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals. This review examines some of the issues relating to exposure of amphibian populations to these chemicals and places emphasis on mechanisms of toxicity. Several mechanisms are highlighted, including those that may disrupt thyroid activity, retinoid pathways, and sexual differentiation. Special emphasis is also placed on the various interactions that may occur between different agro-chemicals and between chemicals and other environmental factors. We also examine the indirect effects on amphibian populations that occur when their surrounding pond communities are altered by chemicals. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The area is devoted to rice farming and receives large amounts of pesticides. Industrial pollutants are also carried to the delta by the river. The information accumulated during the last 25 year on the effect of such pollution on the biota is reviewed in order to identify the existing gaps and needs for management. Organochlorine pesticides were legally used until 1977, which has resulted in the widespread presence of these compounds in the Ebro delta biota. Lethal, sublethal or other detrimental effects of these pesticides on wildlife in the area were poorly investigated, but negative effects on the reproduction of ducks and herons were reported. Nowadays, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are the main responsible of organochlorine pollution in the area: concentrations in biota samples are higher than levels observed in nearby coastal areas, as a result of the significant PCB inputs by the river which, in 1990, were evaluated at 126 kg yr(-1). The massive use of herbicides is thought to have contributed to the elimation of macrophyte vegetation in the lagoons during the eighties, which had strong consequences on diving ducks and coot populations. Weed control is also related to the loss of biodiversity held by rice fields. The massive and inadequate use of organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides (involving more than 20 000 t yr(-1)) has produced some waterbird mortality events, and may have direct and indirect effects on other non-target organisms. The accumulation in the soil of lead pellets used in waterfowl shooting is estimated to kill some 16 300 waterbirds in the Ebro delta every year.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Vet, Dept Farmacol & Toxicol, Toxicol Lab, Bellaterra, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,,tox@cc.uab.es,"Mañosa, Santiago/R-6693-2018; Guitart, Raimon/N-2755-2015; Mateo, Rafael/A-3117-2011","Guitart, Raimon/0000-0002-8396-0407; Mateo, Rafael/0000-0003-1307-9152; Manosa, Santi/0000-0003-0681-1552",,,,,85,113,116,1,99,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

Pesticides are used widely to kill unwanted organisms in crops, public areas, homes and gardens and medicinally to kill parasites. Many are proven or suspected to be EDs. Ancient physiological similarities between different vertebrate groups suggest that disorders observed in wildlife may indicate risks to humans. This makes accurate risk assessment and effective legislation difficult. In this paper, the hazardous properties of pesticides which are known to have ED properties are reviewed in order to assess the implications for risk assessment. As well as data on sources of exposure in the United Kingdom (UK) an assessment of the evidence on the health effects of ED pesticides is also included. In total, 127 have been identified from the literature and their effects and modes of action are listed in this paper. Using the UK as a case study, the types and quantities of pesticides used, and their methods of application are assessed, along with their potential pathways to humans. In the UK reliable data are available only for agricultural use, so non-agricultural routes of pesticide exposure have been poorly quantified. The exposure of people resident in or visiting rural areas could also have been grossly under-estimated. Material links between ED pesticide use and specific illnesses or deformities are complicated by the multifactorial nature of disease, which can be affected by factors such as diet. Despite these difficulties, a large body of evidence has accumulated linking specific conditions to ED pesticides in wildlife and humans. A more precautionary approach to the use of ED pesticides, especially for non-essential purposes is proposed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All fights reserved.","[McKinlay, R.; Plant, J. A.; Bell, J. N.

We applied a bifactorial multigeneration study in order to test if GCC conditions alter the effects of low pesticide concentrations on life history and genetic diversity of the aquatic model organism Chironomus riparius. Experimental populations of the species were chronically exposed to a low concentration of the fungicide pyrimethanil (half of the no-observed-adverse-effect concentration: NOAEC/2) under two dynamic present-day temperature simulations (11.0-22.7 degrees C; 14.0-25.2 degrees C) and one future scenario (16.5-28.1 degrees C). During the 140-day multigeneration study, survival, emergence, reproduction, population growth, and genetic diversity of C. riparius were analyzed. Our results reveal that high temperature and pyrimethanil act synergistically on the midge C. riparius. In simulated present-day scenarios, a NOAEC/2 of pyrimethanil as derived from a life-cycle toxicity test provoked only slight-to-moderate beneficial or adverse effects on C. riparius. In contrast, exposure to a NOAEC/2 concentration of pyrimethanil at a thermal situation likely for a summer under GCC conditions uncovered adverse effects on mortality and population growth rate. In addition, genetic diversity was considerably reduced by pyrimethanil in the future scenario, but only slightly under current climatic conditions. Our multigeneration study under near-natural (climatic) conditions indicates that not only the impact of climate change, but also low concentrations of pesticides may pose a reasonable risk for aquatic insects in future.","[Mueller, Ruth; Seeland, Anne; Jagodzinski, Lucas S.; Diogo, Joao B.; Nowak, Carsten; Oehlmann, Joerg] LOEWE Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Mueller, Ruth; Seeland, Anne; Oehlmann, Joerg] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Aquat Ecotoxicol, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [Jagodzinski, Lucas S.] Natl Univ Ireland, Sc Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Cork, Ireland; [Diogo, Joao B.; Nowak, Carsten] Nat Hist Museum, D-63571 Gelnhausen, Germany; [Diogo, Joao B.; Nowak, Carsten] Senckenberg Res Inst, D-63571 Gelnhausen, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; University College Cork; Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN),"Müller, R (corresponding author), LOEWE Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",ruthmueller@bio.uni-frankfurt.de,"Oehlmann, Jörg/B-4565-2010; Muller, Ruth/GXA-1300-2022; Muller, Ruth/D-2551-2009; Nowak, Carsten/A-4466-2014","Oehlmann, Jörg/0000-0002-6075-2701; Muller, Ruth/0000-0003-3909-3876; Nowak, Carsten/0000-0002-3139-1951","Hesse's Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and the Arts","Hesse's Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and the Arts","Funded by the research funding programme 'LOEWE, Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlich-okonomischer Exzellenz' of Hesse's Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and the Arts.",,61,28,29,4,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of contaminants in marine biota in the Canadian Arctic and where possible, discusses biological effects. The geographic coverage of information on contaminants such as persistent organochlorines (OCs) (PCBs, DDT- and chlordane-related compounds, hexachlorocyclohexanes, toxaphene) and heavy metals (mercury, selenium, cadmium, lead) in tissues of marine mammal and sea birds is relatively complete. Ah major beluga, ringed seal and polar bear stocks along with several major sea bird colonies have been sampled and analysed for OC and heavy metal contaminants. Studies on contaminants in walrus are limited to Fore Basin and northern Quebec stocks, while migratory harp seals have only been studied recently at one location. Contaminant measurements in bearded seal, harbour seal, bowhead whale and killer whale tissues from the Canadian Arctic are very limited or non-existent. Many of the temporal trend data for contaminants in Canadian Arctic biota are confounded by changes in analytical methodology, as well as by variability due to age/size, or to dietary and population shifts. Despite this, studies of OCs in ringed seal blubber at Holman Island and in sea birds at Prince Leopold Island in Lancaster Sound show declining concentrations of PCBs and DDT-related compounds from the 1970s to 1980s then a levelling off during the 1980s and early 1990s. For other OCs, such as chlordane, HCH and toxaphene, limited data for the 1980s to early 1990s suggests few significant declines in concentrations in marine mammals or sea birds. Temporal trend studies of heavy metals in ringed seals and beluga found higher mean concentrations of mercury in more recent (1993/1994) samples than in earlier collections (1981-1984 in eastern Arctic, 1972-1973 in western Arctic) for both species. Rates of accumulation of mercury are also higher in present day animals than 10-20 years ago. Cadmium concentrations in the same animals (eastern Arctic only) showed no change over a 10-year period. No temporal trend data are available for metals in sea birds or polar bears. There have been major advances in knowledge of specific biomarkers in Canadian Arctic biota over the past few years. The species with the most significant risk of exposure to PCBs and OC pesticides may be the polar bear which, based on comparison with EROD activity in other marine mammals (beluga, ringed seal), appears to have elevated CYP1A-mediated activity. The MFO enzyme data for polar bear, beluga and seals suggest that even the relatively low levels of contaminants present in Arctic animals may not be without biological effects, especially during years of poor feeding.

For each of 30 declining species, attention is focused on: (1) the external causes of population declines, (2) the demographic mechanisms and (3) experimental tests of proposed external causal factors, together with the outcome of (4) specific conservation measures and (5) agri-environment schemes. Although each species has responded individually to particular aspects of agricultural change, certain groups of species share common causal factors. For example, declines in the population levels of seed-eating birds have been driven primarily by herbicide use and the switch from spring-sown to autumn-sown cereals, both of which have massively reduced the food supplies of these birds. Their population declines have been associated with reduced survival rates and, in some species, also with reduced reproductive rates. In waders of damp grassland, population declines have been driven mainly by land drainage and the associated intensification of grassland management. This has led to reduced reproductive success, as a result of lowered food availability, together with increased disturbance and trampling by farm stock, and in some localities increased nest predation. The external causal factors of population decline are known (with varying degrees of certainty) for all 30 species considered, and the demographic causal factors are known (again with varying degrees of certainty) for 24 such species. In at least 19 species, proposed causal factors have been tested and confirmed by experiment or by local conservation action, and 12 species have been shown to benefit (in terms of locally increased breeding density) from options available in one or more agri-environment schemes. Four aspects of agricultural change have been the main drivers of bird population declines, each affecting a wide range of species, namely: (1) weed-control, mainly through herbicide use; (2) the change from spring-sown to autumn-sown cereal varieties, and the associated earlier ploughing of stubbles and earlier crop growth; (3) land drainage and associated intensification of grassland management; and (4) increased stocking densities, mainly of cattle in the lowlands and sheep in the uplands. These changes have reduced the amounts of habitat and/or food available to many species. Other changes, such as the removal of hedgerows and 'rough patches', have affected smaller numbers of species, as have changes in the timings of cultivations and harvests. Although at least eight species have shown recent increases in their national population levels, many others seem set to continue declining, or to remain at a much reduced level, unless some relevant aspect of agricultural practice is changed.","Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Monks Wood Res Stn, Huntingdon PE28 2LS, Cambs, England",UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),"Newton, I (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Monks Wood Res Stn, Abbots Ripton, Huntingdon PE28 2LS, Cambs, England.",ine@ceh.ac.uk,"Newton, Ian/AAV-5830-2021","Newton, Ian/0000-0002-7757-4008",,,,,186,536,615,8,341,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0019-1019,1474-919X,,IBIS,Ibis,OCT,2004,146,4,,,,,579,600,,10.1111/j.1474-919X.2004.00375.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2004.00375.x,,,22,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,857QA,,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000224132200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This review examines one of the consequences of climate change that has only recently attracted attention: namely, the effects of climate change on the environmental distribution and toxicity of chemical pollutants. A review was undertaken of the scientific literature (original research articles, reviews, government and intergovernmental reports) focusing on the interactions of toxicants with the environmental parameters, temperature, precipitation, and salinity, as altered by climate change. Three broad classes of chemical toxicants of global significance were the focus: air pollutants, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including some organochlorine pesticides, and other classes of pesticides. Generally, increases in temperature will enhance the toxicity of contaminants and increase concentrations of tropospheric ozone regionally, but will also likely increase rates of chemical degradation. While further research is needed, climate change coupled with air pollutant exposures may have potentially serious adverse consequences for human health in urban and polluted regions. Climate change producing alterations in: food webs, lipid dynamics. ice and snow melt, and organic carbon cycling could result in increased POP levels in water, soil, and biota. There is also compelling evidence that increasing temperatures could be deleterious to pollutant-exposed wildlife. For example, elevated water temperatures may alter the biotransformation of contaminants to more bioactive metabolites and impair homeostasis. The complex interactions between climate change and pollutants may be particularly problematic for species living at the edge of their physiological tolerance range where acclimation capacity may be limited. In addition to temperature increases, regional precipitation patterns are projected to be altered with climate change. Regions subject to decreases in precipitation may experience enhanced volatilization of POPs and pesticides to the atmosphere. Reduced precipitation will also increase air pollution in urbanized regions resulting in negative health effects, which may be exacerbated by temperature increases. Regions subject to increased precipitation will have lower levels of air pollution, but will likely experience enhanced surface deposition of airborne POPs and increased run-off of pesticides. Moreover, increases in the intensity and frequency of storm events linked to climate change could lead to more severe episodes of chemical contamination of water bodies and surrounding watersheds. Changes in salinity may affect aquatic organisms as an independent stressor as well as by altering the bioavailability and in some instances increasing the toxicity of chemicals. A paramount issue will be to identify species and populations especially vulnerable to climate-pollutant interactions, in the context of the many other physical, chemical, and biological stressors that will be altered with climate change. Moreover, it will be important to predict tipping points that might trigger or accelerate synergistic interactions between climate change and contaminant exposures, (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Noyes, Pamela D.; McElwee, Matthew K.; Miller, Hilary D.; Clark, Bryan W.; Van Tiem, Lindsey A.; Walcott, Kia C.; Erwin, Kyle N.; Levin, Edward D.] Duke Univ, Integrated Toxicol & Environm Hlth Program, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Noyes, Pamela D.; McElwee, Matthew K.; Miller, Hilary D.; Clark, Bryan W.; Van Tiem, Lindsey A.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [McElwee, Matthew K.] Natl Inst Environm Hlth Sci, Mol Toxicol Lab, NIH, DHHS, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA",Duke University; Duke University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS),"Levin, ED (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Integrated Toxicol & Environm Hlth Program, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",edlevin@duke.edu,"Levin, Edward/GLV-2991-2022","Noyes, Pamela/0000-0003-1654-4056; McElwee, Matthew/0000-0003-1659-6112",NIH; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)),"This review is supported [in part] by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

The current view of plant diversity effects on element cycling is based on short-term grassland studies that discount possibly slow belowground feedbacks to aboveground diversity. Furthermore, these grasslands were established on formerly arable land associated with changes in soil properties, e. g., accumulation of organic matter. We hypothesize that the plant diversity-N cycle relationship changes with time since establishment. We assessed the relationship between plant diversity and (1) aboveground and soil N storage and (2) NO3-N and NH4-N availability in soil between 2003 and 2007 in the Jena Experiment, a grassland experiment established in 2002 in which the number of plant species varied from 1 to 60. The positive effect of plant diversity on aboveground N storage (mainly driven by biomass production) tended to increase through time. The initially negative correlation between plant diversity and soil NO3-N availability disappeared after 2003. In 2006 and 2007, a positive correlation between plant diversity and soil NH4-N availability appeared which coincided with a positive correlation between plant diversity and N mineralized from total N accumulated in soil. We conclude that the plant diversity-N cycle relationship in newly established grasslands changes with time because of accumulation of organic matter in soil associated with the establishment. While a positive relationship between plant diversity and soil N storage improves soil fertility and reduces fertilizing needs, increasingly closed N cycling with increasing plant diversity as illustrated by decreased NO3-N concentrations in diverse mixtures reduces the negative impact of agricultural N leaching on groundwater resources.","[Oelmann, Yvonne] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Integrated Nat Sci, Dept Geog, D-56070 Koblenz, Germany; [Buchmann, Nina] ETH, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Gleixner, Gerd; Habekost, Maike; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef; Steinbeiss, Sibylle] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; [Habekost, Maike] BASF, D-67117 Limburgerhof, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Rosenkranz, Stephan] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Geog, Earth Syst Sci Res Ctr, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Steinbeiss, Sibylle] German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Groundwater Ecol, Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen, Neuherberg, Germany; [Temperton, Vicky M.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Chem & Dynam Geosphere, ICGIII Phytosphere Inst, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Weigelt, Alexandra] Univ Leipzig, Dept Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers, Inst Biol 1, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Weisser, Wolfgang W.] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Wilcke, Wolfgang] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Koblenz & Landau; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Max Planck Society; BASF; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Leipzig University; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of Bern,"Oelmann, Y (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Integrated Nat Sci, Dept Geog, Univ Str 1, D-56070 Koblenz, Germany.",yvonneoelmann@uni-koblenz.de; nina.buchmann@ipw.agrl.ethz.ch; ggleix@bgc-jena.mpg.de; mhabe@bgc-jena.mpg.de; croscher@bgc-jena.mpg.de; stephan.rosenkranz@uni-mainz.de; dschulze@bgc-jena.mpg.de; sibylle.steinbeiss@helmholtz-muenchen.de; v.temperton@fz-juelich.de; alexandra.weigelt@uni-jena.de; wolfgang.weisser@uni-jena.de; wolfgang.wilcke@giub.unibe.ch,"Wilcke, Wolfgang/P-4620-2016; Gleixner, Gerd/O-4215-2019; Weigelt, Alexandra/JCN-8278-2023; Oelmann, Yvonne/J-8730-2016; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014; Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Weisser, Wolfgang W/B-9718-2014","Wilcke, Wolfgang/0000-0002-6031-4613; Gleixner, Gerd/0000-0002-4616-0953; Weigelt, Alexandra/0000-0001-6242-603X; Oelmann, Yvonne/0000-0003-3513-6568; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/0000-0001-6188-9219; Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Weisser, Wolfgang W/0000-0002-2757-8959; Temperton, Vicky/0000-0003-0543-4521",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG [FOR 456],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank the many people who helped with the management of the experiment and the many student helpers to all the helpers who assisted during the weeding campaigns.

Changes in climate variability are often associated with altered disturbance regimes and temporal patterns of resource availability. Here we show that increased variability of soil nutrients strongly promotes another key process of global change, plant invasion. In experimental plant communities, the success of one of the world's most invasive plants, Japanese knotweed, is two-to four-fold increased if extra nutrients are not supplied uniformly, but in a single large pulse, or in multiple pulses of different magnitudes. The superior ability to take advantage of variable environments may be a key mechanism of knotweed dominance, and possibly many other plant invaders. Our study demonstrates that increased nutrient variability can promote plant invasion, and that changes in environmental variability may interact with other global change processes and thereby substantially accelerate ecological change.","[Parepa, Madalin; Fischer, Markus; Bossdorf, Oliver] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Dept Biol, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Bossdorf, O (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Dept Biol, Altenbergrain 21, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland.",bossdorf@ips.unibe.ch,"Bossdorf, Oliver/A-8328-2008; Parepa, Madalin/G-4352-2011; Fischer, Markus/C-6411-2008","Bossdorf, Oliver/0000-0001-7504-6511;",Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A_122408]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [31003A_122408] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),We thank Bernhard Schmid for his feedback on the manuscript.

Initial reports included unintentional poisoning of birds from ingestion of spent lead shot and predator control agents, alkali poisoning of waterbirds, and die-offs from maritime oil spills. With the advent of synthetic pesticides in the 1930s and 1940s, effects of DDT and other pesticides were investigated in free-ranging and captive wildlife. In response to research findings in the US and UK, and the publication of Silent Spring in 1962, public debate on the hazards of pollutants arose and national contaminant monitoring programs were initiated. Shortly thereafter, population-level effects of DDT on raptorial and fish-eating birds were documented, and effects on other species (e.g., bats) were suspected. Realization of the global nature of organochlorine pesticide contamination, and the discovery of PCBs in environmental samples, launched long-range studies in birds and mammals. With the birth of ecotoxicology in 1969 and the establishment of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry in 1979, an international infrastructure began to emerge. In the 1980s, heavy metal pollution related to mining and smelting, agrichemical practices and non-target effects, selenium toxicosis, and disasters such as Chernobyl and the Exxon Valdez dominated the field. Biomarker development, endocrine disruption, population modeling, and studies with amphibians and reptiles were major issues of the 1990s. With the turn of the century, there was interest in new and emerging compounds (pharmaceuticals, flame retardants, surfactants), and potential population-level effects of some compounds. Based upon its history, wildlife toxicology is driven by chemical use and misuse, ecological disasters, and pollution-related events affecting humans. Current challenges include the need to more thoroughly estimate and predict exposure and effects of chemical-related anthropogenic activities on wildlife and their supporting habitat.","US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Rattner, BA (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, BARC E 308,10300 Baltimore Ave, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.",Barnett_Rattner@usgs.gov,,,,,,,105,100,126,6,206,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0963-9292,1573-3017,,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Ecotoxicology,OCT,2009,18,7,,,,,773,783,,10.1007/s10646-009-0354-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-009-0354-x,,,11,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,488AC,19533341,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000269319900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is a critical knowledge gap because the shape of this relationship indicates the extent to which loss of the first few species will influence biomass production. Using two long-term (>= 13 years) biodiversity experiments, we show that the effects of diversity on biomass productivity increased and became less saturating over time. Our analyses suggest that effects of diversity-dependent ecosystem feedbacks and interspecific complementarity accumulate over time, causing high-diversity species combinations that appeared functionally redundant during early years to become more functionally unique through time. Consequently, simplification of diverse ecosystems will likely have greater negative impacts on ecosystem functioning than has been suggested by short-term experiments.","[Reich, Peter B.; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2753, Australia; [Tilman, David; Isbell, Forest; Mueller, Kevin; Hobbie, Sarah E.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Tilman, David] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Flynn, Dan F.

Therefore, lady beetle populations are exposed to lambdacyhalothrin sprays that may foster tolerance to this insecticide. This study was conducted to confirm the occurrence of resistance in the lady beetle Eriopis connexa (Germar) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) to lambda-cyhalothrin and to characterize the inheritance of resistance after eight progressive selection with insecticide dosages based on the LD50 determined for the F1 generation. Dose-mortality curves were determined for parental populations, F1 hybrids and backcross progenies. Parameters regarding the heritability of resistance to lambda-cyhalothrin in E. connexa allow estimating 10-fold increase in the initial LD50 after 54.5 generations of successive selections. The resistance of E. connexa to lambda-cyhalothrin was characterized as autosomally inherited and incompletely dominant, and influenced by a major gene with possible influence of secondary genes. Additionally, the resistance in E. connexa varies from functionally dominant to functionally recessive depending on the dose used. These findings indicate that insecticide resistance in E. connexa can be selected in the field as determined for field-collected individuals, and subsequently enhanced under laboratory conditions. Its characterization presented here is an important step toward linking biological and chemical control within pest management regarding the lady beetle and lambda-cyhalothrin targeting different pest groups.

In an effort to resolve the controversy, we conducted a qualitative meta-analysis on the effects of ecologically relevant atrazine concentrations on amphibian and fish survival, behavior, metamorphic traits, infections, and immune, endocrine, and reproductive systems. DATA SOURCES: We used published, peer-reviewed research and applied strict quality criteria for inclusion of studies in the meta-analysis. DATA SYNTHESIS: We found little evidence that atrazine consistently caused direct mortality of fish or amphibians, but we found evidence that it can have indirect and sublethal effects. The relationship between atrazine concentration and timing of amphibian metamorphosis was regularly non-monotonic, indicating that atrazine can both accelerate and delay metamorphosis. Atrazine reduced size at or near metamorphosis in 15 of 17 studies and 14 of 14 species. Atrazine elevated amphibian and fish activity in 12 of 13 studies, reduced antipredator behaviors in 6 of 7 studies, and reduced olfactory abilities for fish but not for amphibians. Atrazine was associated with a reduction in 33 of 43 immune function end points and with an increase in 13 of 16 infection end points. Atrazine altered at least one aspect of gonadal morphology in 7 of 10 studies and consistently affected gonadal function, altering spermatogenesis in 2 of 2 studies and sex hormone concentrations in 6 of 7 studies. Atrazine did not affect vitellogenin in 5 studies and increased aromatase in only I of 6 studies. Effects of atrazine on fish and amphibian reproductive success, sex ratios, gene frequencies, populations, and communities remain uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is much left to learn about the effects of atrazine, we identified several consistent effects of atrazine that must be weighed against any of its benefits and the costs and benefits of alternatives to atrazine use.","[Rohr, Jason R.; McCoy, Krista A.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Rohr, JR (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, SCA 110,4202 E Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",jasonrohr@gmail.com,"Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021",,"National Science Foundation [DEB 0516227]; U.S. Department of Agriculture [NRI 2006-01370, 2009-35102-0543]; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency STAR [R833835]; EPA [150194, R833835] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency STAR(United States Environmental Protection Agency); EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"Funds were provided by grants from the National Science Foundation (DEB 0516227), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (NRI 2006-01370 and 2009-35102-0543), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency STAR grant R833835) to J.R.R.",,120,235,288,18,190,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

In a field study, here we show that the widely used herbicide, atrazine, was the best predictor ( out of more than 240 plausible candidates) of the abundance of larval trematodes ( parasitic flatworms) in the declining northern leopard frog Rana pipiens. The effects of atrazine were consistent across trematode taxa. The combination of atrazine and phosphate - principal agrochemicals in global corn and sorghum production - accounted for 74% of the variation in the abundance of these often debilitating larval trematodes ( atrazine alone accounted for 51%). Analysis of field data supported a causal mechanism whereby both agrochemicals increase exposure and susceptibility to larval trematodes by augmenting snail intermediate hosts and suppressing amphibian immunity. A mesocosm experiment demonstrated that, relative to control tanks, atrazine tanks had immunosuppressed tadpoles, had significantly more attached algae and snails, and had tadpoles with elevated trematode loads, further supporting a causal relationship between atrazine and elevated trematode infections in amphibians. These results raise concerns about the role of atrazine and phosphate in amphibian declines, and illustrate the value of quantifying the relative importance of several possible drivers of disease risk while determining the mechanisms by which they facilitate disease emergence.","[Rohr, Jason R.; Raffel, Thomas R.; Halstead, Neal] Univ S Florida, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Rohr, Jason R.; Raffel, Thomas R.] Penn State Univ, Penn State Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Schotthoefer, Anna M.; Lieske, Camilla; Beasley, Val R.] Univ Illinois, Coll Vet Med, Urbana, IL 61802 USA; [Carrick, Hunter J.] Penn State Univ, Sch Forest Resources, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Hoverman, Jason T.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Forest Wildlife & Fisheries, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Johnson, Catherine M.; Johnson, Lucinda B.; Schoff, Patrick K.] Univ Minnesota, Nat Resources Res Inst, Duluth, MN 55811 USA; [Piwoni, Marvin D.] Illinois Waste Management & Res Ctr, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth,"Rohr, JR (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",jasonrohr@gmail.com,"Hoverman, Jason/AGR-0056-2022; Carrick, Hunter/IUP-4379-2023; Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021","Hoverman, Jason/0000-0002-4002-2728; Johnson, Catherine/0000-0003-3241-9394; Johnson, Catherine/0000-0003-3133-9616","National Science Foundation [DEB-0809487]; US Department of Agriculture [NRI 2008-00622, NRI 2008-01785]; US Environmental Protection Agency STAR [R825867, R833835]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [0809487] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; EPA [150194, R833835] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); US Environmental Protection Agency STAR(United States Environmental Protection Agency); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"We thank J.

A major concern with the adoption of Bt crops is their potential impact on nontarget organisms including biological control organisms. Regulatory frameworks should advocate a step-wise (tiered) approach to assess possible nontarget effects of Bt crops. Laboratory and glasshouse studies have revealed effects on natural enemies only when Bt-susceptible, sublethally damaged herbivores were used as prey or host, with no indication of direct toxic effects. Field studies have confirmed that the abundance and activity of parasitoids and predators are similar in Bt and non-Bt crops. In contrast, applications of conventional insecticides have usually resulted in negative impacts on biological control organisms. Because Bt-transgenic varieties can lead to substantial reductions in insecticide use in some crops, they can contribute to integrated pest management systems with a strong biological control component.","Swiss Fed Res Stn Agroecol & Agr, Agroscope FAL Reckenholz, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Romeis, J (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Stn Agroecol & Agr, Agroscope FAL Reckenholz, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",Joerg.Romeis@fal.admin.ch,"Meissle, Michael/C-3127-2009; Romeis, Joerg/J-5360-2013","Meissle, Michael/0000-0002-5391-7715; Romeis, Joerg/0000-0003-3652-8360",,,,,123,499,594,1,355,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1087-0156,1546-1696,,NAT BIOTECHNOL,Nat.

Chrysoperla cameo has been shown to develop resistance to the insecticides in the field. Knowledge of the evolution and genetics of resistance to insecticides in natural enemies could enable to explain how effectively natural enemies can be implemented in different IPM systems. To examine this, a population of C carnea from Multan Pakistan was collected and was subjected to deltamethrin selection in the laboratory. Bioassays at generation G(1) gave resistance ratios of 47, 86, 137, 76 and 110 for deltamethrin, alphamethrin lambdacyhalothrin, chlorpyrifos and profenofos respectively compared with susceptible Lab-PK. Bioassays at G(4) with a deltamethrin-selected population (Delta-SEL) showed that selection gave resistance ratios of 896 and 30 for deltamethrin compared with the Lab-PK and UNSEL, respectively. Cross-resistance to other insecticides tested was observed in the selected population. A notable feature of the Delta-SEL strain was that resistance to deltamethrin, alphamethrin, lambdacyhalothrin, chlorpyrifos and profenofos did not decline over the course of four generations. Synergism tests with microsomal oxidase (MO) and esterase-specific inhibitors indicated that the deltamethrin resistance was associated with MO and, possibly, esterase activity. Reciprocal crosses between the Delta-SEL and Lab-PK strains indicated that resistance was autosomal and incompletely dominant. A direct test of monogenic inheritance suggested that resistance to deltamethrin was controlled by more than one locus. The broad spectrum of resistance, cross resistance, incompletely dominant mode of inheritance and stability of resistance to insecticides suggest that Delta-SEL population of C cameo could be compatible with most spray programs.

Pesticides add to and interact with other stressors of ecosystem processes, including surface-water diversions, losses of spawning and rearing habitats, nonnative species, and harmful algal blooms. Assessing the cumulative effects of pesticides on species or ecological functions has been difficult for historical, legal, conceptual, and practical reasons. To explore these challenges, we examine current-use (modern) pesticides and their potential connections to the abundances of fishes in the San Francisco Estuary (California). Declines in delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and other species have triggered mandatory and expensive management actions in the urbanizing estuary and agriculturally productive Central Valley. Our inferences are transferable to other situations in which toxics may drive changes in ecological status and trends.","[Scholz, Nathaniel L.] US Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Fleishman, Erica] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Brown, Larry] US Geol Survey, Sacramento, CA USA; [Werner, Inge] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anat Physiol & Cell Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Johnson, Michael L.] Univ Calif Davis, Aquat Ecosyst Anal Lab, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Brooks, Marjorie L.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Mitchelmore, Carys L.] Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA; [Schlenk, Daniel] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Scholz, NL (corresponding author), US Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA.",nathaniel.scholz@noaa.gov,"Scholz, Nathaniel L/L-1642-2013; Brooks, Marjorie L/M-5692-2014; Mitchelmore, Carys/E-5278-2012","Scholz, Nathaniel L/0000-0001-6207-0272; Mitchelmore, Carys/0000-0003-1373-4479","University of California, Santa Barbara [113325G004]; US Fish and Wildlife Service [113325G004]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","University of California, Santa Barbara(University of California System); US Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We appreciate the helpful comments of Kate Macneale, David Baldwin, Jana Labenia, Chris Mebane, Mark Munn, and Lisa Nowell on draft versions of the manusctipt.

Accordingly, a great deal of previous research has characterized physiological mechanisms of toxicity in animals exposed to contaminants. In contrast, effects of contaminants on fish behaviour are less frequently studied. Because behaviour links physiological function with ecological processes, behavioural indicators of toxicity appear ideal for assessing the effects of aquatic pollutants on fish populations. Here we consider the many toxicants that disrupt complex fish behaviours, such as predator avoidance, reproductive, and social behaviours. Toxicant exposure often completely eliminates the performance of behaviours that are essential to fitness and survival in natural ecosystems, frequently after exposures of lesser magnitude than those causing significant mortality. Unfortunately, the behavioural toxicity of many xenobiotics is still unknown, warranting their future study. Physiological effects of toxicants in the literature include disruption of sensory, hormonal, neurological, and metabolic systems, which are likely to have profound implications for many fish behaviours. However, little toxicological research has sought to integrate the behavioural effects of toxicants with physiological processes. Those studies that take this multidisciplinary approach add important insight into possible mechanisms of behavioural alteration. The most commonly observed links with behavioural disruption include cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition, altered brain neurotransmitter levels, sensory deprivation, and impaired gonadal or thyroid hormone levels. Even less frequently studied are the implications of interrelated changes in behaviour and physiology caused by aquatic pollutants for fish populations. We conclude that future integrative, multidisciplinary research is clearly needed to increase the significance and usefulness of behavioural Judicators for aquatic toxicology, and aim to highlight specific areas for consideration.

An emphasis on life histories and population fitness through the use of demography, other measures of population growth rate, field studies, and modeling are being exploited to derive better estimates of pesticide impacts on both target and nontarget species than traditional lethal dose estimates. We review the state of the art in demographic toxicology, an approach to the evaluation of toxicity that uses life history parameters and other measures of population growth rate. A review of the literature revealed that 75 studies on the use of demography and similar measures of population growth rate in toxicology have been published since 1962. Of these 75 studies, the majority involved arthropods. Recent evaluations have indicated that ecotoxicological analysis based on population growth rate results in more accurate assessments of the impacts of pesticides and other toxicants because measures of population growth rate combine lethal and sublethal effects, which lethal dose/concentration estimates (LD/LC50) cannot do. We contend that to advance our knowledge of toxicant impacts on arthropods, the population growth rate approach should be widely adopted.","Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Puyallup, WA 98371 USA; Univ Washington, Tacoma, WA 98402 USA",Washington State University; University of Washington; University of Washington Tacoma,"Stark, JD (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, 7612 Pioneer Way E, Puyallup, WA 98371 USA.",stark@puyallup.wsu.edu; banksj@u.washington.edu,"Banks, John E./AAN-2300-2020; Banks, John/D-4194-2012","Banks, John E./0000-0001-6793-7613;",,,,,120,510,603,3,152,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4170,1545-4487,,ANNU REV ENTOMOL,Annu.

Risk quotients are then compared to levels of concern (LOC) which vary depending upon the type of pesticide being evaluated and the type of organisms likely to be exposed. The LOC is supposed to account for all of the types of uncertainty associated with the risk assessment. There are several problems associated with this process. For example, populations do not respond the same way to wtoxicant exposures as do individuals. Populations, if thinned may compensate for losses and actually grow faster than expected. Furthermore, exposure to pesticides can result in a proportion of a population dying while the remaining individuals are impaired due to multiple sublethal effects. Another issue is that the few species that are used for the development of toxicity data may not be good representatives of the many species they are supposed to protect. These species are often chosen based on ease of rearing and evaluation, not because they are good representatives of many species. Susceptibility of a population to pesticides is influenced by life history traits and differences in life history traits are not considered in the current risk assessment process. It has also been shown that populations of organisms often exist as mixtures of life stages. The makeup of the population structure can greatly influence susceptibility to pesticides and this is also not considered in the risk assessment process. Furthermore, different life stages may exhibit vastly different susceptibility to toxicants, yet usually only one life stage is evaluated. In this chapter, the current risk assessment process and new approaches to improve risk assessment of pesticides are discussed. The new approach consists of developing population-level measures of toxicant effect that incorporate the total effect (lethal and multiple sublethal effects) followed by population modeling to determine the probability that specific concentrations of pesticides will drive populations to extirpation or whether populations will recover.","Washington State Univ, Puyallup Res & Extens Ctr, Puyallup, WA 98371 USA",Washington State University,"Stark, JD (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Puyallup Res & Extens Ctr, 2606 W Pioneer, Puyallup, WA 98371 USA.",starkj@wsu.edu,,,,,,,42,3,3,0,10,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0097-6156,1947-5918,978-0-8412-2703-3,ACS SYM SER,ACS Symp.

In contrast to nicotine, epibatidine, and other ammonium or iminium nicotinoids, which are mostly protonated at physiological pH, the neonicotinoids, are not protonated and have an electronegative nitro or cyano pharmacophore. Agonist recognition by the nicotinic receptor involves cation-pi interaction for nicotinoids in mammals and possibly a cationic subsite for interaction with the nitro or cyano substituent of neonicotinoids in insects.

In this project, active and passive biomonitoring experiments with brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) and stone loach (Barbatula barbatula) were performed in two small streams in southern Germany between 1995 and 1999 in parallel with investigations on contaminant mixtures in the laboratory in order to evaluate the suitability of biomarkers representing different levels of biological organization for the assessment of pollution in small streams. In addition to biomarker studies, the morphology of the test streams was characterized and limnological and chemical parameters were monitored. Early life stage tests and ecological studies of brown trout and stone loach population demography, of the fish assemblages, and the macro- and meiozoobenthos communities in the two test streams were included in the project. Several causality criteria were addressed by means of combined (1) laboratory and field studies, (2) chemical, biological, and statistical investigations, and (3) in vivo and in vitro studies that allowed establishment of cause-effect relationships at different biological levels. The comparison of results obtained at these levels allowed identification of mechanisms responsible for the respective effects (coherence of association, biological plausibility). Finally, individual responses (biomarkers, bioindicators) could be extrapolated to higher biological levels (population, community) thus addressing the criteria of 'time order' and 'coherence of association'.","Steinbeis Transfer Ctr Ecotoxicol & Ecophysiol, D-72108 Rotenburg, Germany; Univ Tubingen, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany; UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; Univ Bielefeld, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; Univ Hohenheim, Inst Zool, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; Heidelberg Univ, Dept Zool, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Steinbeis Transfer Ctr Appl & Environm Chem, D-72762 Reutlingen, Germany; Bavarian Environm Protect Agcy, D-86179 Augsburg, Germany; Geookol Consulting, D-82362 Weilheim, Germany; Inst Freshwater Biol & Inland Fisheries, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; Fed Inst Hlth Protect Consumers & Vet Med, Dept Assessment Chem, D-14191 Berlin, Germany; Bavarian Water Management Agcy, Dept Aquat Ecol Res, D-82407 Wielenbach, Germany; Univ Bern, Dept Anim Pathol, Ctr Fish & Wildlife Hlth, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; Consultants Aquat Ecol & Engn, A-4600 Wels, Austria",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Bielefeld; University Hohenheim; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); University of Bern,"Triebskorn, R (corresponding author), Steinbeis Transfer Ctr Ecotoxicol & Ecophysiol, Kreuzlingerstr 1, D-72108 Rotenburg, Germany.",stz.oekotox@gmx.de,"Köhler, Heinz-R./AAL-1350-2021; Luckenbach, Till/G-6482-2015; Segner, Helmut/D-5714-2014; Schuurmann, Gerrit/E-7962-2017","Luckenbach, Till/0000-0001-6204-1033; Schuurmann, Gerrit/0000-0002-3789-1703; Oberemm, Axel/0000-0002-4355-4404",,,,,34,21,23,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,1549-7860,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

Its relatively short half-life in the environment has been a major factor in its increased use and substitution for insecticides known to persist in the environment for long periods of time and accumulate in animal tissues. The relatively high water solubility of carbofuran coupled with its relatively low adsorption on soils and sediments permits natural surface waters to become a repository for excessive amounts of the insecticide escaping treated areas or being accidentally introduced into aquatic environments. Carbofuran's persistence is directly related to the pH of the water. The compound is stable in acid waters, but subject to increasing chemical hydrolysis as the water becomes more alkaline. Microbial populations in water, sediments, and flooded soils also reduce the persistence of carbofuran. Carbofuran is very toxic to fish. Generally, fish LC50S for carbofuran are below 1 mg/l. While accidental spraying of carbofuran poses a threat to the aquatic environment, a more serious threat is the carbofuran in runoff water from fields or orchards immediately after treatment. Localized fish kills have been reported in such instances.","ENVIRONM CANADA, INLAND WATERS DIRECTORATE, WATER QUAL BRANCH, OTTAWA K1A 0H3, ONTARIO, CANADA",Environment & Climate Change Canada,"TROTTER, DM (corresponding author), MONENCO CONSULTANTS LTD, DIV ENVIRONM, CALGARY, ALBERTA, CANADA.",,,,,,,,109,49,54,1,18,CRC PRESS LLC,BOCA RATON,"2000 CORPORATE BLVD NW, JOURNALS CUSTOMER SERVICE, BOCA RATON, FL 33431 USA",1040-838X,,,CRIT REV ENV CONTR,,,1991,21,2,,,,,137,176,,10.1080/10643389109388412,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10643389109388412,,,40,Environmental Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF153,,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:A1991GF15300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This review gives a brief history of the use of DDT in various countries and presents the results of epidemiologic and experimental studies of carcinogenesis. Even though its use has been prohibited in most countries for ecologic considerations, mainly because of its negative impact on wildlife, it is still used in some developing countries for essential public health purposes, and it is still produced for export in at least three countries. Due to its stability and its capacity to accumulate in adipose tissue, it is found in human tissues, and there is now not a single living organism on the planet that does not contain DDT. The possible contribution of DDT to increasing the risks for cancers at various sites and its possible role as an endocrine disruptor deserve further investigation. Although there is convincing experimental evidence for the carcinogenicity of DDT and of its main metabolites DDE and DDD, epidemiologic studies have provided contrasting or inconclusive, although prevailingly negative, results. The presence and persistence of DDT and its metabolites worldwide are still problems of great relevance to public health. Efficient pesticides that do not have the negative properties of DDT, together with the development of alternative methods to fight malaria, should be sought with the goal of completely banning DDT.","NN Blokhin Russian Canc Res Ctr, Moscow 115478, Russia; FF Erisman Fed Crime Hyg, Moscow, Russia; Aurisina, Trieste, Italy",N.N.

Studies published between 1980 and 2001 were reviewed. Most studies covered organophosphates and synthetic pyrethroids in lentic waters. The most sensitive taxa were representatives of crustaceans, insects and fish. Based on toxic units, threshold values were equivalent for compounds with a similar mode of action. This also accounted for the nature and magnitude of direct effects at higher concentrations. Although laboratory single species toxicity tests may not allow predictions on precise ecological effects, some generalisations on effects and recovery can be made with respect to acute standard laboratory EC50 data. The NOECecosystem usually is a factor of 10 or more higher than first tier acceptable concentrations, particularly in the case of single applications and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Acceptable concentrations, as set by the EU first tier approach, appear to be protective. Recovery of sensitive endpoints usually occurs within 2 months of the ( last) application when peak concentrations remain lower than (0.1 - 1) x EC50 of the most sensitive standard test species. The consistency of response patterns found in model ecosystem studies can be useful when estimating the ecological risks of pesticides. The use of an effect classification system was also helpful in evaluating effects.","Wageningen UR, Alterra, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Van Wijngaarden, RPA (corresponding author), Wageningen UR, Alterra, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",rene.vanwijngaarden@wur.nl,"van den brink, Paul/AAT-7144-2020; van den Brink, Paul J/E-8315-2013","van den brink, Paul/0000-0002-7241-4347;",,,,,131,158,178,1,125,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0963-9292,1573-3017,,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Ecotoxicology,APR,2005,14,3,,,,,355,380,,10.1007/s10646-004-6371-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-004-6371-x,,,26,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,913UE,15943110,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000228178200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

A number of studies have described behavioural effects caused to captive birds by neurotoxic pesticides, but it is very difficult to measure such effects in the field, which is a serous limitation given their potential to cause adverse effects at the population level. The mode of action, and the neurotoxic and behavioural effects of these compounds are briefly reviewed before considering evidence for their effects in the laboratory and field. Behavioural effects may cause adverse changes at the population level either directly or indirectly. Direct effects upon avian populations may be due to disturbances of reproduction, feeding, or avoidance of predation. Indirect effects on predators may be the consequence of direct action upon the prey population leading to either (1) reduction of numbers of the prey population, or (2) selective predation by the predator upon the most contaminated individuals within the prey population. Attention is given to the historic evidence for neurotoxic and behavioural effects of persistent organochlorine insecticides, raising the question of retrospective analysis of existing data for this once important and intensively studied class of compounds. Less persistent pesticides currently in use may also have neurotoxic effects upon birds in the field. Sometimes, as with some OPs, their effects may outlast the persistence of their residues, and the ecotoxicity and persistence of some may be affected by interactions with other environmental chemicals. The development of new mechanistic biomarker assays could improve understanding of behavioural effects and possible associated effects at the population level caused by such compounds in the field.","Cissbury, Colyton EX24 6NJ, Devon, England",,"Walker, CH (corresponding author), Cissbury, Colyton EX24 6NJ, Devon, England.",,"Moreira, Eder N/B-2309-2010",,,,,,50,51,68,1,89,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0963-9292,1573-3017,,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Ecotoxicology,FEB-AUG,2003,12,1-4,,,,,307,316,,10.1023/A:1022523331343,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1022523331343,,,10,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,648BB,12739877,,,,2024-03-03,WOS:000181129000026,View Full Record in Web of Science

Because there are survivors, evaluating efficacy for these new pesticides requires a subtler approach than simply counting dead animals. To address this problem we developed a demographic model that incorporates the biological complexities of age structure, temperature sensitivity, and pesticide persistence. We illustrate our approach using experimental data on the activity of Margosan-O, a derivative from the neem tree, applied to the pea aphid. We found that, although the activity of Margosan-O decreased with time after spray, it persisted for similar to 2 wk at 25 degrees C. To quantify the effectiveness of Margosan-O we introduced a new measure, a delay in population growth, since the result of a spray was short-term reduction in population growth from which the population will eventually recover. The practical question is then how long is the delay? We found the delay to be >5 d at 25 degrees C for 40-60 mu L/L of Margosan-O and longer at lower temperatures. Proper estimation of the delay required including the age selectivity and persistence of Margosan-O. We suggest that generally these new less lethal chemicals demand a new approach in toxicology both theoretically and experimentally.","Univ Washington, Dept Zool, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Washington State Univ, Puyallup Res & Extens Ctr, Puyallup, WA 98371 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Washington State University,"Wennergren, U (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Biol, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",,,,,,,,21,33,39,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Cereal grain and seeds of Polygonum (knotgrasses and persicarias), Stellaria (chickweeds) and Chenopodium (goosefoots) are important for the bird species considered. Seeds and green material of Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Brassicaceae are also widely used, the seeds of Asteraceae particularly by cardueline finches. Declining bird species are not associated with particular plant foods, but reductions in overall diversity and abundance of food plants have taken place in intensively managed arable land. Grassland intensification has reduced floral diversity, and the quantity and diversity of grass and broad-leaved seed produced, but some plant species of value to granivorous birds benefit from high-nitrogen environments and may increase in availability (e.g., Stellaria - chickweeds). During the breeding season, Acrididae (grasshoppers), Symphyta (sawflies), Araneae (spiders), Chrysomelidae (leaf-beetles), Curculionidae (weevils), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths and their larvae), Aphididae (aphids) and Tipulidae (crane-flies and their larvae) are important foods. The first four are associated with the diet of declining bird species, and all are sensitive to insecticide applications. Herbicide applications, increasing specialisation of farmland, loss of uncultivated field margin habitats, and ploughing are also associated with generally detrimental effects on invertebrate groups in arable habitats. In intensively managed grassland, loss of grasshoppers, ants, spiders and lepidopteran larvae removes an important source of food for younger chicks of a wide range of species. Some phytophagous taxa and predators, however, may be more abundant due to the greater standing biomass of plant material. Overall, intensification and specialisation of arable and grassland systems is likely to have reduced the availability of key invertebrate and seed foods for birds. However, there is also evidence that reversal of intensification, especially in arable systems can result in rapid recovery of these resources. In intensively managed farmland, uncultivated field margins, hedgerows, ditches and road verges are likely to become increasingly important sources of seed and invertebrate food for birds.
