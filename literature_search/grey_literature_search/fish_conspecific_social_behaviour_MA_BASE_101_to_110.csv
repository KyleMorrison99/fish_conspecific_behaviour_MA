Imidacloprid (IM) and thiamethoxam (TM) are neonicotinoids found together in Wisconsin surface waters, yet no studies have evaluated their combined toxicities to fish. The aim of this study was to better understand the potential for IM and IM:TM mixtures to activate the nAChR and to affect the development (hatching, length, survival) or behavior (embryonic motor activity, predator escape response) of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Embryos and larvae were exposed to IM or to mixtures of IM:TM. Only survival was significantly affected. Chronic exposure to 0.2 μg IM/L and 1:1 0.02 and 200 μg IM/L:μg TM/L resulted in reduced survival. Survival improved in those exposed to mixtures (1:1 2, 20 μg IM/L:μg TM/L, 1:4 0.05 μg IM/L: 0.20 μg TM/L, and 1:5 0.05 μg IM/L: 0.25 μg TM/L); however, high mortality was observed in controls. The effect on survival, but not behavior implies that IM and TM may have low affinities for the vertebrate nAChR and interact with a different system in the fish, which was supported by molecular modeling.","2023","2024-03-01 05:45:42","2024-03-01 05:45:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_US","","","","","","","","","","","Biology; Pesticides; Toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study provides basic toxicological information about two toad species, Bufo valliceps Wiegmann, 1833, and B. velatus Bragg & Sanders, 1951, in relation to two major agricultural pesticides, carbofuran and trifluralin, that are widely used and applied directly to the soil. Toads of both species were collected at a site in East Texas in 1993, 1994, and 1995, and maintained in captivity for several months to observe feeding behavior and general health. Animals were exposed dermally by ventral absorption for 6 hr to carbofuran or trifluralin. Toads were checked prior to the exposure and at 2, 4, and 6 hr for loss of righting reflex and hind-leg retraction, hyperactivity, iris contraction, and mass increase. Animals were also tested pre-and post-dosing for feeding response. Toads were frozen at 1 hr and 1 d post-dosing for brain cholinesterase (ChE) analysis. Trifluralin showed differences from controls only within the post-feeding test; dosed animals did not eat. There were significant differences between controls and toads exposed to carbofuran in all behavioral categories. A carbofuran concentration of approximately 5.5% of the highest recommended field application rate (2.5 gal/acre) caused loss of righting reflex in 30% of B. valliceps and 60% B velatus at 6 hr. Behavioral tests between species, with the exception of hyperactivity, revealed differences in sensitivities to carbofuran with B. velatus being more sensitive.

Sixteen 560-liter microcosms including prey, predator, and competitor populations were employed over a wide range of energy and habitat resource availability and exploitation of the top predator. Chronic exposure to the pesticide dieldrin was used to perturb systems near steady states. Empirical generalizations from ecological theory, productivity theory, and fishery exploitation theory were incorporated to explain in part such performances as development, structure, and persistence of the laboratory ecosystems, their communities, populations, and individual organisms. Dynamic (developmental) and near steady-state community structure and organization were detailed for guppy, amphipod, snail, planaria, and algae populations and for a benthic detritus and microorganism component. Near steady-state population performances including density, production, yield, and size-specific growth and reproduction were determined for the guppy population in order to demonstrate the concordance of life history, population, and community level performances with changes in environmental conditions. A system of isoclines on a series of interrelated resource-utilizer and competition phase planes was employed to gain a better understanding of the structure and apparent organization of the laboratory systems. The 16 systems were established with a 0.6 gram/day alfalfa ration, 20 percent of each tank bottom covered with gravel for invertebrate habitat, and 0, 10, 20, or 40 percent guppy exploitation per month. Exploitation directly affected the size of the guppy populations near steady state (through observed changes in production, yield, growth, and reproduction) and indirectly affected the size of snail and amphipod populations which responded to competition and/or predation from guppies. Following many months of near steady-state system behavior (i. e. restricted fluctuations of ...","","2024-03-01 05:45:42","2024-03-01 05:45:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","Oregon State University","","English [eng]","","","","","","","","","","","Aquatic ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Allowing traits to cluster into phenotypes may produce outcomes that are more clinically and biologically relevant. Additionally, environmental exposures often occur in a mixture. Accounting for such a possibility may reduce bias that results from assuming exposures are independent. We sought to estimate associations between organophosphorus pesticides and neurodevelopment after accounting for these possibilities. Methods: A prospective birth cohort of 404 mother/infant pairs were followed from pregnancy until the children were 6 and 7-9 years of age. Factor analysis was performed on parent-report measures of child executive functioning and behavior, and performance-based measures of IQ. We estimated associations between demographic characteristics, maternal characteristics and environmental exposures during pregnancy and early childhood, and the neurodevelopmental factor scores after accounting for correlations among the factors. Results: We determined the existence of a seven factor solution. Smoking during pregnancy, canned fish consumption, maternal education, and HOME environment were associated with various factors. Prenatal exposure to ∑DMPs was associated with worse Internalizing factor scores but better Executive Functioning factor scores, while ∑DEPs were associated with worse Working Memory Index scores. Estimates were generally stronger for factor scores than for individual instrument-specific items. Conclusions: Associations between prenatal exposure to OPs and worse internalizing behaviors and working memory scores are supported by prior findings in both human and animal studies. Associations with improved executive functioning are not supported by prior literature and may be a result of residual confounding by maternal executive functioning and dietary sources of OPs. A phenotypic outcome modeling approach may provide advantages ...","2016","2024-03-01 05:45:42","2024-03-01 05:45:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate School","","English","","","","","","","","","","","anxiety; childhood development; Environmental health; Epidemiology; mixtures; Neurodevelopment; organophosphate pesticides; organophosphorus pesticides; Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Als zusätzlicher interagierender Faktor wurde der Einfluss von Sauerstoffmangel auf die Toxizität von Substanzen miteinbezogen. Zur Untersuchung von komplexen Interaktionen wurde das Räuber-Beute-Verhalten zwischen Zebrabärblingen und Chironomiden-Larven (Chironomus riparius) analysiert. Einen weiteren Teil dieser Arbeit bilden Untersuchungen mit komplexen Kohlenwasserstoff-Mischungen in Form der water accomodated fraction von Rohöl und deren Auswirkungen auf das Verhalten von marinen Amphipoden (Corophium volutator), ebenso wie Halbfreilandversuche mit Süsswasseramphipoden (Gammarus pulex). Meine Untersuchungen haben gezeigt, dass Effekte verschiedener Substanzen auf Amphipoden und Fische auf verschiedenen biologischen Organisationsebenen und in umweltrelevanten Konzentrationen auftreten. Es konnte nachgewiesen werden, dass abiotische Parameter die Wirkung von Schadstoffen modifizieren. Bei der Untersuchung von Schadstoffmischungen mit gleichen oder unterschiedlichen Wirkmechanismen war in der Mehrheit der Fälle eine additive Wirkung der kombinierten Stressoren zu beobachten, die in der Regel auch für alle untersuchten Parameter (Enzymaktivität, Bewegungsaktivität, Entwicklungsstörungen, Mortalität) konsistent vorhanden war. Auswirkungen des neurotischen Insektizids Chlorpyrifos auf Interaktionen zwischen Fischen und Chironomiden konnten in umweltrelevanten Konzentrationsbereichen detektiert werden. Die Wirkung der water accommodated fraction von Rohöl, die ein großes Problem für aquatische Organismen in Küstenlebensgemeinschaften darstellt, konnte durch Änderungen im Verhalten des marinen Amphipoden Corophium volutator angezeigt werden. Für die kontinuierliche Überwachung der Gewässerqualität an Monitoringstationen hat sich der einheimische Bachflohkrebs Gammarus pulex als geeigneter und relevanter Testorganismus erwiesen, da er auf komplexe Schadstoffmischungen im Oberflächenwasser sensitiv reagiert. Insgesamt haben sich Verhaltensparameter in der vorliegenden Arbeit als integrative, relevante und sensitive Parameter bei den verschiedenen Fragestellungen bewährt, die auch zur Analyse von interspezifischen Interaktionen dienen können. Zur Beurteilung der Auswirkungen von Schadstoffen auf Organismen in der Umwelt sollten abiotische Parameter und Mischungen von Chemikalien miteinbezogen werden. Des Weiteren sind biochemische Messungen, ebenso wie Verhaltenstests, wichtig, um die Toxizität von Schadstoffen adäquat beurteilen zu können. Für ein integriertes Verständnis der Auswirkungen von Chemikalien auf aquatische Organismen sollte daher eine Batterie verschiedener Methoden, ebenso wie realistischere Expositionsszenarien berücksichtigt werden. ; In this work, the effects of various single substances (pesticides and metals) as well as binary mixtures of them on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and larvae were assessed on biochemical, developmental, and organism levels. The influence of oxygen depletion on the toxicity of substances was included as an additional interacting factor. To analyse complex interactions, the predator-prey behaviour between zebrafish and chironomid larvae (Chironomus riparius) was investigated. Another aspect of this work were studies on complex mixtures of hydrocarbons such as the water accommodated fraction of crude oil, and their effects on the behaviour of marine amphipods (Corophium volutator), as well as semi-field experiments with freshwater amphipods (Gammarus pulex). My investigations showed that effects of various substances in environmentally relevant concentration ranges are exerted on different levels of biological organisation, both in amphipods and fish. It could be shown that abiotic parameters modify the effects of pollutants. When investigating mixtures of substances with similar or different modes of action, additivity occurred in the majority of cases which usually were consistent for all investigated parameters (enzyme activity, locomotor activity, developmental impairment, mortality). Effects of the neurotoxic insecticide chlorpyrifos on the interactions between fish and chironomids could be detected in environmentally relevant concentration ranges. The effects of the water accommodated fraction of crude oil which represents a great risk for aquatic organisms in costal habitats were displayed by alterations in the behaviour of the marine amphipod Corophium volutator. For a continuous monitoring of water quality in monitoring stations, the resident amphipod Gammarus pulex proved to be a suitable and relevant test organism, as it responds sensitive to complex mixtures of pollutants in surface waters. In summary, behavioural parameters proved to be integrative, relevant and sensitive parameters for the different research topics/questions in the present work, and can also be recommended to be used to analyse interspecific interactions. To judge on the effects of pollutants on aquatic organisms in the environment, abiotic parameters as well as mixtures of pollutants should be included. Additionally, biochemical measurements as well as behavioural tests are important, to adequately assess the toxicity of pollutants. Therefore, for an integrated understanding of the effects of chemicals on aquatic organisms, a battery of different methods as well as more realistic exposure scenarios should be taken into account.","2009","2024-03-01 05:45:42","2024-03-01 05:45:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universität Tübingen","","de_DE","","","","","","","","","","","570; Acetylcholinesterase; Bewegung; Biomonitoring; Early life stage test; ecotoxiology; Embryotest; Locomotion; MixTox model; MixTox Modell; Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor®; Umwelttoxikologie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the persistence, runoff and vertical distribution of widely used active ingredients (a.i.: imidacloprid, metalaxyl, mefonoxam, pendimethalin, rimsulfuron, carbofuran) are investigated and an analytical methodology for the simultaneous determination of their residues in water and soil is developed. Finally, the effect of the application of herbicides on the native flora of the cultivated areas is investigated. The results show: In experimental fields, the half-life of active substances ranged from 7.4 to 27.2 days, on the surface soil layer. The physicochemical properties of active ingredient, the tobacco and maize crops, the soil slope (%) effect on the half-life of active ingredient. The losses due to surface runoff for all active ingredients were less than 1% of the applied dose. The soil slope, the solubility of the active ingredient and the cultivation practices influenced the surface runoff of the pesticides. Detection of pesticide residues in deeper soil layers in an attempt to visualize the leaching of pesticides has shown that 4/5 active ingredient can move to greater soil depths, indicating that heavy irrigation and rainfall immediately after the application of pesticides can increase the risk of contamination of groundwater. In contrast, the active ingredient rimsulfuron appears to be rapidly degraded. Its half-life on maize soil columns is 5 days. At 45 days of application, no rimsulfuron was detected at all analyzed soil depths, indicating its inability to contaminate groundwater aquifers.

The aim of the study was to evaluate various agricultural products found locally as substitutes of peat and straw in the biomixture. For this reason 3 different laboratory studies (degradation, sorption and leaching studies) were conducted in our laboratory. The organic substrates included in the study were various lignocellulosic materials and composts or peat. Soils with different physicochemical characteristics were also included in the study. Analytical methods for pesticide residues determination in biomixtures and soil were developed and evaluated. The chromatographic analysis of the 9 pesticides included in the study (terbuthylazine, dimethoate, metalaxyl-M, metribuzin, buprofezin, chlorpyrifos, iprodione, indoxacarb, azoxystrobin) was performed by gas chromatography with NPD and ECD detectors, while the analysis of the metabolites of terbuthylazine, metribuzin and chlorpyrifos were performed by HPLC with UV detector.
