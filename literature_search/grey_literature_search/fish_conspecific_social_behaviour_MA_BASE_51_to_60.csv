Temperature rising affect the toxic properties of pollutants and the sensitiveness of organisms to chemicals stress. Inversely, chemical exposure may decrease the thermal tolerance of ectothermic species, as fish. In this context, we studied the response of a biological model in aquatic toxicology, the goldfish (Carassius auratus), to individual and combined chemical and thermal stresses. In this aim, we exposed the goldfish to environmental relevant concentrations of herbicide and fungicide mixtures at two temperatures for 96 hours or 16 days. The fish responses were assessed from the molecular level to individual endpoints, including omic approaches (proteomic and metabolomic), biochemical analyses (cortisol, antioxidant defenses, cellular energy allocation), indexes (somatic and condition factors) and behavioral assays (sediment reworking, activity, exploration and feeding). Our results showed that individual chemical or thermal stresses induced a general stress response including biochemical, metabolic, physiological and behavioral compensations. The absence of deleterious effect on the global condition of fish suggested the implementation of an efficient and adaptive stress response, while the hypoactivity of fish exposed to pesticide mixtures could entrain a decreased performance and fitness into the wild. At the opposite, the combined chemical and thermal stresses induced reciprocal inactivation of the stress response, with antagonism effect on cortisol secretion, antioxidant defense induction and metabolic compensation. However, increased effect on behavioral traits and decreased global condition of fish were observed. Our study showed that temperature rising sensitized fish to pesticide exposure. Finally, inhibited stress response in fish exposed to pesticide cocktails raises concerns about species conservation an ecosystem under multiple pressures. ; Les changements ...","2015","2024-03-01 05:38:20","2024-03-01 05:38:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","HAL CCSD","","fr","","","","","","","","","","","[SDV.EE]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Ecology; Carassius auratus; Changements climatiques; Climate change; environment; Etude multi-échelles; Fongicides; Fungicides; Herbicides; Multi-level study; Réponse de stress; Stress response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Para ello, se llevaron a cabo ensayos de depredación combinando tratamientos con depredador y presas expuestos y no expuestos a plaguicidas, sobre los cuales se evaluaron y contrastaron las respuestas etológicas y metabólicas. Los resultados demostraron que el tratamiento donde depredador y presas no fueron expuestos a plaguicidas presentó las mayores tasas de depredación, mientras que el tratamiento donde depredador y presas fueron simultáneamente expuestos a los plaguicidas presentó las menores tasas de depredación. Los renacuajos expuestos a F, Gly y TFS redujeron la actividad natatoria y la respiración, y además, alteraron los niveles normales de actividad de la AChE y la BChE, al igual que S. marmoratus.

To that effect, predation tests, mixing treatments with both, predator and prey being exposed and not exposed to pesticides, were carried out and their ethological and metabolic responses were evaluated and contrasted. Results showed that the treatment where predator and prey were not exposed to pesticides presented higher predation rates, whereas the treatment where predator and prey were simultaneously exposed to pesticides showed the lowest predation rates. Tadpoles exposed to F, Gly and TFS reduced their swimming activity as well as their breathing, and also, modified the normal levels of AChE and BChE activity, same as S. marmoratus did. As a conclusion, this study demonstrated that pesticides F, Gly and TFS altered the interaction between predator and prey among S. marmoratus and amphibian larvae, interfering in ethological responses from prey and metabolic ones from both, prey and predator. ; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas ; Universidad Nacional del Litoral","2015","2024-03-01 05:38:20","2024-03-01 05:38:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","spa","","","","","","","","","","","Anguilas; Behavior; Comportamiento; Eels; Enzimas; Enzymes; Interacción depredador-presa; Pesticides; Plaguicidas; Predator-prey interaction; Renacuajos; Tadpoles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Salmonid populations in the Bay-Delta have been declining, including the endangered Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Previous studies suggest that estrogenic compounds can inhibit smoltification, and the pyrethroid pesticide bifenthrin has been shown to have estrogenic effects. Thus, the objective of my research was to investigate the effects of bifenthrin and climate change stressors on the neuroendocrine response of juvenile salmonids. Trout alevin and fry were exposed to 110C, 16.40C and 190C temperatures and then immediately challenged to sea water (SW) for 24 hours. Trout parr were slowly acclimated to SW and simultaneously exposed to the same temperature regime. Estradiol-17β, cortisol, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine hormone levels were measured in blood serum or whole animal homogenates using ELISAs. Brain growth hormone 1, brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2, and gill Na+/K+ ATPase mRNA levels were measured using qPCR. Alevin were more sensitive to salinity than temperature, and fry were more susceptible to increasing temperatures, thus demonstrating stage-dependent responses to climate change stressors. To evaluate the combined effects of bifenthrin and temperature, Chinook alevin, fry, and parr were exposed to the same temperature stressors for 10 days (alevin) or 14 days (fry and parr) and, in the final 96 hours of rearing, fish were exposed to 0, 0.15, or 1.5µg/L bifenthrin. The same endpoints were measured as in the trout, with the addition of quantifying testosterone levels, the expression of brain dopamine receptor 2α, and measuring brain dopamine levels. In addition, a predator avoidance Y-Maze behavioral assay was conducted on parr. Bifenthrin significantly impacted olfactory-mediated predator avoidance behaviors in parr.

These salamanders can be used for both field- and lab-based work as they are human-tolerant (Arenas et al. 2015). Some of the biological fields using RBS as a model organism include terrestrial ecology, amphibian ecology, evolutionary biology, regeneration, ecotoxicology, and animal behavior (Fisher-Reid et al. 2021). These salamanders are ecologically influential in forest ecosystems, where their biomass in some locations exceeds that of birds during peak breeding season and may be equal to that of all small mammals combined (Burton & Likens 1975). Of the eight most studied salamanders RBS is the only Plethodontid salamander; RBS is an important inclusion considering that more than half of all salamander species are part of the family Plethodontidae and many of the species are declining (Fisher-Reid et al. 2021). Because RBS are highly philopatric and abundant, studies of its population genetics have been used to ask biogeographic questions at a variety of spatial and temporal scale (Fisher-Reid et al. 2013, Cameron et al. 2017). In ecotoxicology, RBS have been used to study how military waste products and pesticides enter and affect terrestrial food webs (Johnson et al. 2004, 2007, 2010; Bazar et al. 2008, 2009, 2010). In animal behavior, RBS has been used to describe changes in territorial behavior based on food availability (Jaeger et al. 2016). Considering that amphibians are the most threatened vertebrate class due anthropogenic changes to their habitat, it is important that more amphibian model organisms are included in research so that we may understand them better with the aim to conserve them. This master’s research and thesis focuses on two ways in which we can use RBS as a model organism.

For practicality it is important that as many pesticides as possible are compared using a common technique. Mass spectrometry is the method of choice for multi-residue detection techniques, because of its sensitivity and specificity. This thesis comprises a detailed analysis and critical review of the mass spectrometric behaviour of over 600 commonly encountered pesticides and related compounds. The work described in this thesis was undertaken in two tranches, one old and one new. The former experimental work was performed during the author’s employment at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food (Harpenden, Hertfordshire, UK) and at Unilever Research (Colworth House, Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire, UK). The data helped underpin the analytical work of the UK national pesticide residues monitoring surveillance team and the pesticide formulations safety team. Qualitative and quantitative aspects were both important, e.g. for identification and characterisation of active ingredients, contaminants and degradation products in technical pesticide formulations, as well as unambiguous detection and/or confirmation of residue levels in UK fruit and vegetables. The latter experimental work was undertaken recently (2015) at the Cardiff School of Chemistry during the preparation of this thesis. The newly acquired data helped confirm the validity and robustness of the original data, and helped to better understand them. Understanding the complex and sometimes unexpected behaviour of molecules during their extraction/analysis is essential, especially when performing trace analysis at the parts per billion level. Rationalisation of the mass spectrometric fragmentation pathways of these compounds was undertaken in order to better understand the fundamental processes taking place in the mass spectrometer. This improved understanding was essential in order to ensure the ...","2015","2024-03-01 05:38:21","2024-03-01 05:38:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","QD Chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is compounded by regional differences in temperature, wind patterns, underwater topography, and primary productivity that extend from the ocean’s surface to depths of thousands of meters. Many organisms that inhabit the marine environment navigate many environmental changes as they move between regions in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The ability to navigate through different habitat types indicates that marine animals may be adaptable to multiple environments; however, it also suggests that they may be exposed to multiple hazards, including hazards of anthropogenic origin. Rates of anthropogenic inputs of chemicals and litter to the atmosphere and the ocean are increasing. However, many effects of anthropogenic compounds on marine life are only beginning to be understood. In this dissertation, I assessed foraging ecology, contaminants, and the effects of contaminants, in seabirds, which are unique among marine animals because they hunt for fishes and squid from the air, but breed on land. Land-based breeding enables them to be easily studied, and they are good samplers of the vast ocean because they travel tens to thousands of kilometers from the breeding colony to forage. I first tested the hypothesis that seabirds’ foraging behaviors are related to local oceanographic habitats, and that they exhibit behavioral plasticity to exploit the marine environment. GPS-tracking and remotely-sensed environmental data of four species of boobies (Sula spp.) demonstrated adaptable behaviors that changed depending on the type of oceanographic habitat in which boobies foraged (e.g. based on depth, sea surface temperature and topography). Second, I measured blood-based persistent organic pollutants (POP) and mercury contaminant concentrations in boobies and two species of frigatebirds (Fregata spp.) from four colonies in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. I combined blood-based contaminant measurements with two measures of foraging ecology ...","2018","2024-03-01 05:38:21","2024-03-01 05:38:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","eScholarship, University of California","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Biology; Ecology; Environmental science; Gulf of California; Hawaii; marine ecology; ornithology; Pacific Ocean; pesticide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The general objective was to understand the effects of the pesticide on the early life stages of the fish, and to evaluate the suitability of these stages as indicators of contaminated environments. Egg, yolk-sac and larval stages that had been exposed to 300, 120, 90, 60, 30, 10, 5, and 0 g/L of Lindane at 25°C exhibited a 14d-LC of 44 g/L. Similarly, the same stages exposed to 300, 120, 90, 60, 30, 10, and 0 g/L of Lindane at 18°C exhibited a 14d-LC of 37 g/L. Lower temperature thus seemed to increase the susceptibility of the fish to the pesticide. Mortality data were also used to determine the sensitivity of the early developmental stages of fish to the pesticide. At 25°C, the larval stage was the most sensitive stage. At 18°C, on the other hand, the most sensitive stage was the yolk-sac. Results obtained from experiments in which Lindane doses were applied at different intervals within the 14d-period supported these observations. Low temperatures had a marked effect on the sensitivity of the fathead minnow to Lindane. Embryos exposed to Lindane at 18°C showed different temporal distribution of mortality than those at 25°C. A delay in hatching and emergence of smaller larvae were also noted at 18°C. Lordoscoliosis, edemas and hemorrhages were the most common morphological changes induced by the pesticide during the larval stage. The frequency of these abnormalities was linearly related to doses of Lindane. Impaired swimming behavior was also noted, but it was not related to dosages. ; Master of Science","1990","2024-03-01 05:38:21","2024-03-01 05:38:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","Virginia Tech","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Fathead minnow -- Effect of pesticides on; Hexachlorobenzene -- Toxicology; LD5655.V855 1990.T387","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
