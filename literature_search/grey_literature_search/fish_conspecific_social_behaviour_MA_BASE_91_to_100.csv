Global warming is causing sea levels to rise and reducing the supply of food in the oceans. The ecological balance of the ocean has been disturbed by invasive species and cholera. Many pesticides and nutrients used in agriculture end up in the coastal waters, resulting in oxygen depletion that kills marine plants and shellfish. Meanwhile the supply of fish is declining due to overfishing. Yet to flourish, humankind requires healthy oceans; the oceans generate half of the oxygen we breathe, and, at any given moment, they contain more than 97% of the worldâ€™s water. Oceans provide at least a sixth of the animal protein people eat. Living oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reduce climate change impacts. Many civil society groups (NGOs) are trying to protect this shared resource. As example, OceanMind uses satellite data and artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze the movements of vessels and compare their activities to historical patterns. The NGO can thus identify damaging behavior such as overfishing ; data governance, AI, free trade, FTA, personal data, data protection","","2024-03-01 05:43:57","2024-03-01 05:43:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The RIVM conclusion was subsequently rewritten to form an environmental synopsis. The present report describes the procedure followed and the results obtained in the evaluation of the environmental effects of these chemicals. Pesticides have been evaluated on the basis of the test results submitted with regard to their behaviour in soil and water, their effects on organisms present in the environment, such as birds, aquatic organisms (algae, crustaceans and fish), bees and earthworms, and their bioaccumulation potential. Behaviour in soil concerns the rate and route of conversion of a pesticide and its sorption to soil particles. The risks of leaching to the saturated soil layers and of accumulation in the plough layer one year after application of the chemical have been estimated using the Support Group M model developed for this purpose. Behaviour in water includes the rates of hydrolysis and photolysis, and especially the rate and route of conversion of a pesticide in water/sediment systems. Several proposals have been made for classification systems of environmental properties of pesticides in general. A classification system for persistence in particular is badly needed for the intercomparison of the pesticides. It appeared that various data necessary for the evaluation are still lacking for many pesticides. The report also makes proposals for developing several aspects of the evaluation, such as behaviour in air, risks to terrestrial organisms and risks of biomagnification. ; DGM/SR","2012","2024-03-01 05:43:58","2024-03-01 05:43:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu RIVM","","en","","","","","","","","","","","12; 91-1; bees; behaviour in soil; behaviour in water; bioaccumulation; birds; classification; earthworms; environmental characteristics; persistence; pesticides; toxicity; water organisms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Zebrafish (Danio rerio), Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) and Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rams) are popular freshwater animal models. However, their behavioral use in aquatic toxicology research is generally ham pered by oversimplified behavioral tasks and the fact that they are not well-developed animal models for toxicology. Here, this study presented a comparative analysis of multiple behavioral traits (i.e.,anxiety-like behavior, novel object recognition, social preferences, habituation to light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus, and spatial learning and memory). We found that only medaka (d-rR) presented a weak or no response to repeated light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus. In addition, no significant behavioral changes were observed for the three species of juvenile fish models after 7 days of exposure to 0.01% v/v carrier solvents (i.e., ethanol, acetone, and DMSO). In contrast to zebrafish and Chinese rare minnow, medaka showed no significant changes in spatial memory after subacute exposure to 1 mg/L imidacloprid or 2.5 mu g/L chlorpyrifos (cpf); instead, a hyperactivity response in the open field test and reduced social time were induced by cpf and imidacloprid, respectively. Our results suggest that: (1) behavioral effects are negligible when using <0.01% v/v carrier solvents for behavioral assessment: (2) given the differences in sensitivities of behavioral responses, a single behavior used alone as an endpoint may be insufficient for estimating the toxic impacts of pesticides or other environmental contaminants. In conclusion, these results could have major implications for aquatic toxicology research and water quality monitoring and ecoioxicological risk assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Pesticides are toxic to aquatic biota which form important components of the food chain such as fishes. Fishes are important sources of protein in nation-state’s diet. So a detailed understanding of the pollutant effect on fishes would be rewarding for fish conservation and fishery development. Cypermethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid pesticide and potential toxic pollutant contaminating aquatic ecosystems, was investigated in the present study for acute toxicity. Indian major carp (Cirrhinus mrigala) were selected for the bioassay experiments. Experimental fish were subjected to different concentrations of cypermethrin ranging from 0.40 to 6.40μg/l for 96 hrs in test containers. The static renewal test method of acute toxicity test was used. Water temperature was regulated at 26.8 ± 3° C. In addition, behavioral changes such as loss of schooling behaviour, swimming near the water surface, hyper activity, erratic movements, seizures, loss of buoyancy, darting movements and hitting against the walls of test tanks at each cypermethrin concentration were observed for the individual fish. Data acquired from the cypermethrin acute toxicity tests were evaluated using the arithmetic method of Karber. The 96 hr LC50 value for Cirrhinus mrigala was estimated as 4.57μg/l. The possible variation in the LC 50 values can be attributed to toxicant sensitivity, its concentration and duration of exposure. ; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)","2018","2024-03-01 05:43:58","2024-03-01 05:43:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","Akinik Publications","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cirrhinus mrigala; Cypermethrin; LC50; Static renewal bioassay; Toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, our understanding of sublethal effects and underlying toxicologic mechanisms of GBHs are still limited, especially in amphibians. Here, the sublethal effects of a commercial GBH (KISSUN (R)) on tadpoles of a farmland dwelling frog, Microhyla fissipes, were investigated. The 10-d LC50 of ""KISSUN (R)"" GBH was 77.5 mg/L. Tadpoles exposed to 60-120 mg/L showed increased preference to higher temperature. After 10 days exposure, obvious growth suppression was observed in survived GBH-stressed tadpoles, characterized by dosage depended decrement in body mass, body width, total length, etc. GBH-stressed tadpoles also showed decreased tail length/snout-vent length ratio and smaller tail muscle fiber diameter. Comparative transcriptomics (control, 60 mg/L and 90 mg/L groups) was conducted to analyze the underlying molecular processes. GBH-stressed tadpoles showed downregulated transcription of ribosomal proteins and cytoskeleton proteins, which could explain their suppressed whole body and tail muscle growth. Moreover, GBH-stressed tadpoles showed transcriptional downregulation of carbohydrate and lipid catabolism, but upregulation of amino acid catabolism. It suggested a metabolic switch from carbohydrate and lipid to amino acid in these tadpoles. Accordingly, there was a trade-off between protein synthesis and energy production in respect to amino acid allocation, and it provided a metabolic explanation for why protein synthesis was downregulated and growth was suppressed in GBH-stressed tadpoles. In combination with existing literatures, we speculated that GBH might directly target the enzymes in carbohydrate and lipid catabolism, and this metabolic effect of GBH might be common to fish and amphibians. In conclusion, our study provided a systematic insight into the sublethal symptoms of GBH-stressed tadpoles, and a metabolic switch from carbohydrate and lipid to amino acid likely ...","2019","2024-03-01 05:43:58","2024-03-01 05:43:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","","英语","","","","","","","","","","","BEHAVIOR; CELL-GROWTH; CHRONIC TOXICITY; Energy metabolism; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; EXPRESSION; Functional traits; Glyphosate-based herbicide; Growth suppression; Metabolic switch; PESTICIDES; RIBOSOME BIOGENESIS; ROUNDUP; SEX-RATIOS; SURVIVAL; TEMPERATURE; Thermal preference; Toxicology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study aims to investigate the acute effects of MBA to juvenile red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. Firstly, a 96 h semi-static exposure was conducted to determine the Lethal Concentration 50 (LC50) values at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, as well as to assess the behavioral and morphological effects. A second 96 h exposure was conducted at an MBA concentration of 50% of the 96 h LC50 (72.62 mg/L) to assess the histological changes in the gill, perigastric organ, muscle, heart, stomach, and midgut. The results showed that MBA exhibited low acute toxicity with the 24, 48, 72 and 96 h LC50 values of 191.25 (179.37-215.75), 166.81 (159.49-176.55), 154.30 (148.36-160.59) and 145.24 (138.94-151.27) mg/L, respectively. MBA-exposed crayfish showed body jerk, belly arch, equilibrium loss, body and appendage sway, and lethargy; and the dead crayfish showed dark gray or grayish-white body color and separated cephalothorax and abdomen. At 72.62 mg/L, MBA exposure caused significant histopathological alterations, mainly including the cuticular and epithelial degeneration of all the gills; atrophy of tubule lumina and cellular vacuolation of the perigastric organs (61.15 +/- 9.90% of the tubules showed lesions); epithelial hyperplasia (48.40 +/- 9.00%), myocardial fibers and epithelial cell lysis (17.30 +/- 2.01%), and hemocytic infiltration of the hearts; cuticular swelling (15.82 +/- 2.98%) and vacuolate connective tissue (11.30 +/- 2.47%) of the stomachs; atrophied bladder cell and fragmented longitudinal muscles (95.23 +/- 4.77%) of the midguts; and slight myofibers fragmentation and lysis (7.37 +/- 0.53%) of the abdominal muscles. Our results indicate that MBA can cause behavioral, morphological and histopathological effects on juvenile P. clarkii at relatively high concentrations, but its acute toxicity is low compared with many other common herbicides.","2017","2024-03-01 05:43:58","2024-03-01 05:43:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","MDPI AG","","英语","","","","","","","","","","","acute toxicity; behavior; DEGRADATION-PRODUCTS; Environmental & Occupational Health; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; EXPOSURE; FISH; HERBICIDE ACETOCHLOR; histopathology; INSECTICIDE; JUVENILE; LC50; mixture of bensulfuron-methyl and acetochlor; PESTICIDES; Procambarus clarkii; Public; rice herbicide; RIVER-BASIN; TISSUE DISTRIBUTION; WATER","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various environmental pollutants of distinct physicochemical properties are able to impair the retinal development and function of teleost fishes, including dioxin-like pollutants, flame retardants, pesticides, perfluoroalkyl acids, retinoic acids and metals. Considering the availability of developmental and functional database, zebrafish has been the most frequently used as the teleost model to study aquatic visual toxicology. A diversity of visual deficits has been displayed for fishes across multiple levels of biological organizations (e.g., molecule, cell, histology, physiology and behavior). Covering sensitive developmental windows of eyes during early embryogenesis, acute or chronic exposure to xenobiotics can disturb the expressions of visual gene and protein markers, which affect the retinal neurogenesis and induce degeneration of neurons. Morphological structures and physiological responses of retina and optic rectum are then disorganized, eventually compromising the performance of visually-mediated behaviors and recruitment of individuals. Environmental pollutants can cross the blood-retina barrier and accumulate in eyes, which might impact visual system directly. In addition, pollutants are very likely to interrupt retinal development and function indirectly by disturbing the signaling of retinoids and thyroid. However, exact mechanisms of visual toxicity are largely unknown currently. In this review, the development and structure of retina and available tools for studying visual science are described briefly. Advances in visual toxicology are summarized in detail and outlooks for future visual toxicity studies are discussed.","2020","2024-03-01 05:43:58","2024-03-01 05:43:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","ELSEVIER","","英语","","","","","","","","","","","Aquatic toxicology; DECABROMODIPHENYL ETHER BDE-209; DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY; DIETARY EXPOSURE; EARLY-LIFE STAGES; EMBRYONIC EXPOSURE; LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; Marine & Freshwater Biology; PIKE ESOX-LUCIUS; POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; Retinoids; SUBLETHAL EXPOSURE; Thyroid; Toxic mechanism; Toxicology; Visual system; Visual toxicity; ZEBRAFISH LARVAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
