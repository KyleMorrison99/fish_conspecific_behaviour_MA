Insekticidi-neonikotionidi i piretroidi koji su obuhvaćeni u ovom završnom radu pokazali su da djeluju na živčani sustav pčele stvarajući neobjašnjive promjene u ponašanju pčelinje zajednice i najčešće dovodili do uginuća.Ti insekticidi u testiranim zajednicama utjecali su na podjelu rada među pčelama i imali ozbiljan utjecaj na preživljavanje zajednice. Otrovane pčele su stvarale pogreške u plesu te su sakupljačice pogrešno usmjeravali prema izvorima hrane.Utjecali u na smanjenje u proizvodnji potomaka,koji mogu biti štetniji za gubitak zajednice nego gubljenje pčela sakupljačica jer sakupljačice mogu biti brzo zamijenjene.Pesticidi su imali utjecaja na plodnost matice, one su i posljednje od populacije koje su ugibale i to zbog smanjenja populacije u broju radilica.U posljednjih godina zakonskom regulativom neke su grupe neonikotionida koje su najpogubnije za pčele zabranjene. ; The excessive use of pesticides, especially insecticides, in agricultural production has led to the disappearance of many honeybee colonies. Insecticides – neonicotionoids and pyrethroids that are included in this paper showed their impact on the nervous system of bees creating unexplained changes in the behaviour of bee colonies and it usually led to death. These insecticides in tested communities showed to have effect on the division of labour and had a serious impact on colony survival. Poisoned bees created errors in their dance and wrongly directed foraging bees to food resources. It resulted in decreased brood production, which can be more harmful for the loss of colonies than losing foraging bees because they can be quickly replaced. Pesticides have had an impact on the fertility of the queen bee. They are the last of the population to die due to worker bee population reduction. In recent years, legislation has prohibited usage of some neonicotinoid groups that are most lethal for bees.","2015","2024-03-01 05:40:42","2024-03-01 05:40:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sveučilište Josipa Jurja Strossmayera u Osijeku.

There is growing evidence that changes to water conditions due to global change and waterborne pollution can impair coral-reef fish sensory abilities to locate settlement habitats that maximize growth while minimizing mortality risk. However, the inner mechanisms of such impairments remain unknown. In this thesis, I have examined the recruitment phase of the convict surgeonfish Acanthurus triostegus, and determined that the ecological, morphological, physiological and behavioral changes occurring at recruitment correspond to a metamorphosis mediated by thyroid hormones (TH). Then, I investigated whether this metamorphosis is prone to endocrine disruption under anthropogenic disturbances such as elevated sea water temperature and agricultural pesticide pollution. I demonstrated that such pressures can reduce TH levels at a critical developmental stage in coral-reef fishes, impairing their metamorphic processes such as intestine remodeling, sensory organ maturation, and sensory abilities acquisition, further increasing their mortality rates. Overall, this thesis is a holistic analysis that addresses molecular, histological, anatomical, and behavioral assays of multiple stressors affecting coral-reef fish recruitment. It indicates the importance of a proper endocrine function during coral-reef fish recruitment, highlighting the need for a better understanding of these processes for coral-reef conservation. ; Le maintien et le renouvellement des populations de poissons coralliens dépendent en grande partie du recrutement larvaire, c’est-à-dire de l’installation des larves pélagiques dans les habitats récifaux adultes, et de leur survie après s’être métamorphosées en juvéniles.

Everyday an ever-increasing cocktail of intentional and unintentional chemical releases, as well as an unrelenting tidal wave of wastes, particularly plastic waste, enters our waterways and the marine environment.Ocean pollutants include persistent organic pollutants (POPs), endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), mercury and heavy metal compounds, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, oil, plastic wastes and their related chemicals (e.g., BPA, phthalates), personal care products and other industrial and agricultural emissions. We are only just becoming aware of the identity, volume and scope of many ocean pollutants. Their hazards and complex ecological interactions are still unknown.Many ocean pollutants do not have human health data or environmental fate information, and our understanding of the long-term impacts of endocrine disrupting chemicals on the reproduction and behaviour of fish and other marine organisms is still in its infancy.Chemicals enter the marine environment via atmospheric transport, runoff into waterways or by direct disposal into the ocean. It is estimated that 80% of marine chemical pollution originates on land. The vast majority of the global land surface is connected to the marine environment via river systems, so chemical and plastics pollution of rivers is inextricably linked with ocean pollution.","2018","2024-03-01 05:40:43","2024-03-01 05:40:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","IPEN ; National Toxics Network","","eng","","","","","","","","","","","Energy and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study aims to investigate the acute effects of MBA to juvenile red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. Firstly, a 96 h semi-static exposure was conducted to determine the Lethal Concentration 50 (LC50) values at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, as well as to assess the behavioral and morphological effects. A second 96 h exposure was conducted at an MBA concentration of 50% of the 96 h LC50 (72.62 mg/L) to assess the histological changes in the gill, perigastric organ, muscle, heart, stomach, and midgut. The results showed that MBA exhibited low acute toxicity with the 24, 48, 72 and 96 h LC50 values of 191.25 (179.37-215.75), 166.81 (159.49-176.55), 154.30 (148.36-160.59) and 145.24 (138.94-151.27) mg/L, respectively. MBA-exposed crayfish showed body jerk, belly arch, equilibrium loss, body and appendage sway, and lethargy; and the dead crayfish showed dark gray or grayish-white body color and separated cephalothorax and abdomen. At 72.62 mg/L, MBA exposure caused significant histopathological alterations, mainly including the cuticular and epithelial degeneration of all the gills; atrophy of tubule lumina and cellular vacuolation of the perigastric organs (61.15 +/- 9.90% of the tubules showed lesions); epithelial hyperplasia (48.40 +/- 9.00%), myocardial fibers and epithelial cell lysis (17.30 +/- 2.01%), and hemocytic infiltration of the hearts; cuticular swelling (15.82 +/- 2.98%) and vacuolate connective tissue (11.30 +/- 2.47%) of the stomachs; atrophied bladder cell and fragmented longitudinal muscles (95.23 +/- 4.77%) of the midguts; and slight myofibers fragmentation and lysis (7.37 +/- 0.53%) of the abdominal muscles.

Linuron is a phenylurea herbicide used to control a wide variety of vegetative weeds in agriculture in addition to residential applications. However, there are few studies that quantify its toxicity to early developmental stages of fish. The objectives of this study were to assess the acute toxicity of linuron to zebrafish embryos/larvae by measuring mortality, morphological deformities, oxidative respiration, gene expression, and locomotor activity via the Visual Motor Response test. Zebrafish embryos at similar to 6-h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to either embryo rearing medium (ERM), or one dose of 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mu M linuron for up to 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) depending on the assay. Zebrafish larvae exposed to linuron displayed pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, and spinal curvature. Oxidative respiration assessments in embryos using the Agilent XF(e)24 Flux Analyzer revealed that linuron decreased mean basal respiration and oligomycin-induced ATP-linked respiration in 30 hpf embryos at 20 mu M after a 24-hour exposure. In 7 dpf larvae, transcript abundance was determined for 6 transcripts that have a role in oxidative respiration (atp06, cox1, cox4-1, cox5a1, cytb, and nd1); the relative abundance of these transcripts was not altered with linuron treatment. A Visual Motor Response test was conducted on 7 dpf larvae to determine whether linuron (0.625 to 5 mu M) impaired locomotor activity. Larval activity in the dark period decreased in a dose dependent manner and there were indications of hypoactivity as low as 1.25 mu M. Transcript abundance was thus determined for tyrosine hydroxylase (th1) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (gad1b), two rate limiting enzymes that control the production of dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid respectively. The mRNA levels of gad1b = 0.019) were reduced with increasing concentrations of linuron while th1 (p = 0.056) showed a similar decreasing trend, suggesting that neurotransmitter biosynthesis may be altered with exposure to linuron. This study improves knowledge related to the toxicity mechanisms for linuron and is the first to demonstrate that this anti-androgenic chemical impairs oxidative respiration and exerts neurotoxic effects associated with neurotransmitter biosynthesis during early development. These data are significant for environmental risk assessment of agrochemicals.","2020","2024-03-01 05:40:43","2024-03-01 05:40:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","","英语","","","","","","","","","","","Agrochemical; ANTI-ANDROGENS; Behavior; BIOENERGETICS; ENDOCRINE; EXPOSURE; GENE-EXPRESSION; LARVAL ZEBRAFISH; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; Mitochondria; Neurosciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Neurotoxicity; Pesticide toxicity; POTENTIAL MECHANISMS; RESPONSES; Risk assessment; SYSTEM; Toxicology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
