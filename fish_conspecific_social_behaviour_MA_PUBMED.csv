Owing to climate change,  herbicides are the fastest growing sector of the pesticide industry and are  detected in surface water, groundwater, and sediments near agricultural areas. In  freshwater, organisms, including mussels, snails, frogs, and fish, are exposed to  various types and concentrations of herbicides. Invertebrates are sensitive to  herbicide exposure because their defense systems are incomplete. At the top of  the food chain in freshwater ecosystems, fish show high bioaccumulation of  herbicides. Herbicide exposure causes reproductive toxicity and population  declines in freshwater organisms and further contamination of fish used for  consumption poses a risk to human health. In addition, it is important to  understand how environmental factors are physiologically processed and assess  their impacts on reproductive parameters, such as gonadosomatic index and steroid  hormone levels. Zebrafish is a good model for examining the effects of herbicides  such as atrazine and glyphosate on embryonic development in freshwater fish.

All of these behaviors can be impaired or lost as a result of  exposure to toxic contaminants in surface waters. Historically, teleost olfaction  studies have focused on behavioral responses to anthropogenic contaminants (e.g.,  avoidance). More recently, there has been a shift towards understanding the  underlying mechanisms and functional significance of contaminant-mediated changes  in fish olfaction. This includes a consideration of how contaminants affect the  olfactory nervous system and, by extension, the downstream physiological and  behavioral processes that together comprise a normal response to naturally  occurring stimuli (e.g., reproductive priming or releasing pheromones). Numerous  studies spanning several species have shown that ecologically relevant exposures  to common pollutants such as metals and pesticides can interfere with fish  olfaction and disrupt life history processes that determine individual survival  and reproductive success. This represents one of the pathways by which toxic  chemicals in aquatic habitats may increasingly contribute to the decline and  at-risk status of many commercially and ecologically important fish stocks.  Despite our emerging understanding of the threats that pollution poses for  chemical communication in aquatic communities, many research challenges remain.  These include: (1) the determination of specific mechanisms of toxicity in the  fish olfactory sensory epithelium; (2) an understanding of the impacts of complex  chemical mixtures; (3) the capacity to assess olfactory toxicity in fish in situ;  (4) the impacts of toxins on olfactory-mediated behaviors that are still poorly  understood for many fish species; and (5) the connections between sublethal  effects on individual fish and the long-term viability of wild populations. This  review summarizes and integrates studies on fish olfaction-contaminant  interactions, including metrics ranging from the molecular to the behavioral, and  highlights directions for future research.",21/01/2010,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,Feb-26,,1,96,,Aquat Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,2009 Elsevier B.V.

The intensive applications of glyphosate-based herbicides  and its half-life in water lead to its presence in many aquatic ecosystems.  Whereas recent studies have reported neurotoxic effects of glyphosate including  autism-related effects, most of them used extremely high (mg/L to g/L)  concentrations, so it is still unclear if chronic, low environmentally relevant  concentrations of this compound (ng/L to μg/L) can induce neurotoxicity. In this  study we analyzed the neurotoxicity of glyphosate in adult zebrafish after  waterborne exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.3 and 3 μg/L)  for two weeks. Our data showed that exposed fish presented a significant  impairment of exploratory and social behaviors consistent with increased anxiety.  The anterior brain of the exposed fish presented a significant increase in  dopamine and serotonin levels, as well as in the DOPAC/dopamine and homovanillic  acid/dopamine turnover ratios. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in the  dopaminergic system, as th1, th2, comtb, and scl6a3 was downregulated. Finally,  the brain of exposed fish presented a significant increase in the catalase and  superoxide dismutase activities, with a concomitant decrease of glutathione  stores. These changes in the antioxidant defense system are consistent with the  observed increase in oxidative stress, reflected by the increase in the levels of  lipid peroxidation in the brain. The presented results show that current  glyphosate concentrations commonly found in many aquatic ecosystems may have  detrimental consequences on fish survival by decreasing exploration of the  environment or altering social interactions. Furthermore, as zebrafish is also a  vertebrate model widely used in human neurobehavioral studies, these results are  relevant not only for environmental risk assessment, but also for understanding  the risk of chronic low-dose exposures on human health.",2021-01,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,106253,,,146,,Environ Int,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

As a result, insecticides,  herbicides and fungicides are observed worldwide in aquatic environments and  accumulated in aquatic organism. Many insecticides, including organochlorine and  organophosphate, have long been banned long ago because of their high persistence  and non-target toxicity. However, previous studies have shown that persistent  pesticides remain in aquatic organisms. The immune system is the first defense  mechanism against exposure to persistent organic pollutants or pesticides that  have been released into the aquatic environment. Many insecticides have been  reported to cause immunotoxicity, which is represented by alteration of  phagocytic and lysozyme activity. Recent studies show that immunotoxicity by  insecticides exerts a more complex mechanism in fish. Insecticides induce  immunotoxic effects, such as the release of inflammatory cytokines from head  kidney macrophages and inhibition of immune cell proliferation in fish, which can  lead to death in severe cases. Even currently used pesticides, such as  pyrethroid, with low bioaccumulation have been shown to induce  immunotoxicological effects in fish when exposed continuously.

Glyphosate may be used alone, but it is commonly applied as  an active ingredient of the herbicide Roundup(®). This pesticide contains several  adjuvants, which may promote an unknown toxicity. The indiscriminate application  poses numerous problems, both for the health of the applicators and consumers,  and for the environment, contaminating the soil, water and leading to the death  of plants and animals. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is quickly gaining popularity in  behavioral research, because of physiological similarity to mammals, sensitivity  to pharmacological factors, robust performance, low cost, short spawning  intervals, external fertilization, transparency of embryos through larval stages,  and rapid development. The aim of this study was evaluate the effects of  glyphosate and Roundup(®) on behavioral and morphological parameters in zebrafish  larvae and adults. Zebrafish larvae at 3days post-fertilization and adults were  exposed to glyphosate (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5mg/L) or Roundup(®) (0.01, 0.065, and  0.5mg/L) for 96h. Immediately after the exposure, we performed the analysis of  locomotor activity, aversive behavior, and morphology for the larvae and  exploratory behavior, aggression and inhibitory avoidance memory for adult  zebrafish. In zebrafish larvae, there were significant differences in the  locomotor activity and aversive behavior after glyphosate or Roundup(®) exposure  when compared to the control group. Our findings demonstrated that exposure to  glyphosate at the concentration of 0.5mg/L, Roundup(®) at 0.065 or 0.5mg/L  reduced the distance traveled, the mean speed and the line crossings in adult  zebrafish. A decreased ocular distance was observed for larvae exposed at 0.5mg/L  of glyphosate. We verified that at 0.5mg/L of Roundup(®)-treated adult zebrafish  demonstrated a significant impairment in memory. Both glyphosate and Roundup(®)  reduced aggressive behavior. Our data suggest that there are small differences  between the effects induced by glyphosate and Roundup(®), altering morphological  and behavioral parameters in zebrafish, suggesting common mechanisms of toxicity  and cellular response.",01/12/2017,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,32-39,,,392,,Toxicology,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Genetic toxicology and environmental mutagenesis,,1879-3592 1383-5718,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2013.08.008,,"Epigenetics can play a role in interactions between chemicals and exposed species, between species and abiotic ecosystem components or between species of  the same or another population in a community. Technological progress and  advanced insights into epigenetic processes have led to the description of  epigenetic features (mainly DNA methylation) in many ecologically relevant  species: algae, plants, several invertebrates and fish. Epigenetic changes in  plants, insects and cladocerans have been reported to be induced by various  environmental stress factors including nutrition or water deficiency, grazing,  light or temperature alterations, social environment, and dissolved organic  matter concentrations. As regards chemicals, studies in rats and mice exposed to  specific pesticides, hydrocarbons, dioxins, and endocrine disrupting chemicals  demonstrated the induction of epigenetic changes, suggesting the need for further  research with these substances in an ecotoxicological context. In fish and  plants, exposure to polyaromatic hydrocarbons, metals, and soluble fractions of  solid waste affected the epigenetic status. A novel concept in ecotoxicological  epigenetics is the induction of transgenerational stress resistance upon chemical  exposure, as demonstrated in rice exposed to metals. Evaluating epigenetics in  ecotoxicological field studies is a second relatively new approach. A cryptic  lineage of earthworms had developed arsenic tolerance in the field, concurrent  with specific DNA methylation patterns. Flatfish caught in the framework of  environmental monitoring had developed tumours, exhibiting specific DNA  methylation patterns. Two main potential implications of epigenetics in an  ecotoxicological context are (1) the possibility of transgenerationally  inherited, chemical stress-induced epigenetic changes with associated phenotypes  and (2) epigenetically induced adaptation to stress upon long-term chemical  exposure. Key knowledge gaps are concerned with the causality of the relation  between epigenetic and phenotypic changes, the persistence of transgenerational  effects, the implications at population level and the costs of tolerance.  Epigenetic changes following exposure to multiple stressors constitute another  promising area of further research.",2014-04,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,36-45,,,764-765,,Mutat Res Genet Toxicol Environ Mutagen,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The use of pesticides contaminates the aquatic environment, threatening biodiversity and non-target  organisms such as fish. In this study, we investigated the effects of acute  exposure for 96 h hours to atrazine and diuron commercial formulations in  zebrafish (Danio rerio, wild-type AB) embryos and larvae and adult stages. We  observed a significant concentration-dependent survival decrease and hatching  delays in animals exposed to both herbicides and in the frequency of  malformations compared to the control groups. Morphological defects included  cardiac edema, tail reduction, and head malformation. At 7 days  post-fertilization (dpf), atrazine exposure resulted in a reduction in the head  length at 2, 2.5, and 5 mg/L and increased the ocular distance at 1, 2, 2.5, and  5 mg/L atrazine when compared to controls. At the same age, diuron increased the  ocular distance in animals exposed to diuron (1.0 and 1.5 mg/L) and no effects  were observed on the head length. We also evaluated a behavioral repertoire in  larvae at 7 dpf, and there were no significant differences in distance traveled,  mean speed, time in movement, and thigmotaxis for atrazine and diuron when  animals were individually placed in a new environment. The cognitive ability of  the larvae was tested at 7 dpf for avoidance and optomotor responses, and neither  atrazine nor diuron had significant impacts when treated groups were compared to  their corresponding controls.

Environmental exposures to mitochondrial toxicants occur widely and are  increasingly frequent. Exposures to these mitotoxicants may pose a serious threat  to organismal health and the onset of diseases by disrupting immunometabolic  pathways. In this study, we investigated whether the Complex I inhibitor rotenone  could alter C. elegans immunometabolism and disease susceptibility. C. elegans  embryos were exposed to rotenone (0.5 µM) or DMSO (0.125%) until they reached the  L4 larval stage. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by rotenone and  disruption of mitochondrial metabolism were evidenced by rotenone-induced  detrimental effects on mitochondrial efficiency and nematode growth and  development. Next, through transcriptomic analysis, we investigated if this  specific but mild mitochondrial stress that we detected would lead to the  modulation of immunometabolic pathways. We found 179 differentially expressed  genes (DEG), which were mostly involved in detoxification, energy metabolism, and  pathogen defense. Interestingly, among the down-regulated DEG, most of the known  genes were involved in immune defense, and most of these were identified as  commonly upregulated during P. aeruginosa infection. Furthermore, rotenone  increased susceptibility to the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14). However,  it increased resistance to Salmonella enterica (SL1344). To shed light on  potential mechanisms related to these divergent effects on pathogen resistance,  we assessed the activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response  (UPR(mt)), a well-known immunometabolic pathway in C. elegans which links  mitochondria and immunity and provides resistance to pathogen infection. The  UPR(mt) pathway was activated in rotenone-treated nematodes further exposed for  24 h to the pathogenic bacteria P. aeruginosa and S. enterica or the common  bacterial food source Escherichia coli (OP50). However, P. aeruginosa alone  suppressed UPR(mt) activation and rotenone treatment rescued its activation only  to the level of DMSO-exposed nematodes fed with E. coli. Module-weighted  annotation bioinformatics analysis was also consistent with UPR(mt) activation in  rotenone-exposed nematodes consistent with the UPR being involved in the  increased resistance to S. enterica. Together, our results demonstrate that the  mitotoxicant rotenone can disrupt C. elegans immunometabolism in ways likely  protective against some pathogen species but sensitizing against others.",2022,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,840272,,,13,,Front Immunol,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2022 Mello, Bergemann, Fisher, Chitrakar, Bijwadia, Wang, Caldwell, Baugh and Meyer.",,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 35273616  PMCID: PMC8902048,,,,*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins; *Caenorhabditis elegans/metabolism; Animals; Dimethyl Sulfoxide/metabolism; Escherichia coli/metabolism; immunotoxicity; innate immunity; invertebrate; metabolism; mitochondrial toxicants; mitoimmunity; pesticides; Pseudomonas aeruginosa/physiology; Rotenone/toxicity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The state when ROS  generation exceeds elimination leading to an increased steady-state ROS level has  been called ""oxidative stress."" Although ROS association with many pathological  states in animals is well established, the question of ROS responsibility for the  development of these states is still open. Fish represent the largest group of  vertebrates and they inhabit a broad range of ecosystems where they are subjected  to many different aquatic contaminants. In many cases, the deleterious effects of  contaminants have been connected to induction of oxidative stress. Therefore,  deciphering of molecular mechanisms leading to such contaminant effects and  organisms' response may let prevent or minimize deleterious impacts of oxidative  stress. This review describes general aspects of ROS homeostasis, in particular  highlighting its basic aspects, modification of cellular constituents, operation  of defense systems and ROS-based signaling with an emphasis on fish systems. A  brief introduction to oxidative stress theory is accompanied by the description  of a recently developed classification system for oxidative stress based on its  intensity and time course. Specific information on contaminant-induced oxidative  stress in fish is covered in sections devoted to such pollutants as metal ions  (particularly iron, copper, chromium, mercury, arsenic, nickel, etc.), pesticides  (insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides) and oil with accompanying pollutants.  In the last section, certain problems and perspectives in studies of oxidative  stress in fish are described.",2016-04,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,711-747,,2,42,,Fish Physiol Biochem,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Netherlands PMID: 26607273,,,,"Animals; Antioxidants; Biomarkers; Environmental Monitoring/*methods; Fishes/*physiology; Fungicides; Herbicides; Homeostasis; Insecticides; Metals, Heavy/toxicity; Oil; Oxidative damage; Oxidative Stress/*physiology; Pesticides/toxicity; Reactive oxygen species; Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism; Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This  paper reports a study on developing a hyperspectral plant sensing approach to  explore the spectral features of glyphosate-resistant (GR) and  glyphosate-sensitive (GS) plants to evaluate this approach using machine learning  algorithms to differentiate between GR and GS plants. RESULTS: On average, GR  plants have higher spectral reflectance compared with GS plants. The sensitive  spectral bands were optimally selected using the successive projections algorithm  respectively wrapped with the machine learning algorithms of k-nearest neighbors  (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) with Fisher linear  discriminant analysis (FLDA) to classify between GS and GS plants. At 3 weeks  after transplanting (WAT) KNN and SVM could not acceptably classify the GR and GS  plants but they improved significantly with the stages to have their overall  accuracies reaching 73% and 77%, respectively, at 5 WAT. RF and FLDA had a better  ability to classify the plants at 3 WAT but RF was low in accuracy at 2 WAT while  FLDA dropped accuracy to 50% at 4 WAT from 57% at 3 WAT and raised it to 73% at 5  WAT. CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies were conducted developing the hyperspectral  imaging approach to differentiate GR Palmer amaranth from GS Palmer amaranth and  GR Italian ryegrass from GS Italian ryegrass with classification accuracies of  90% and 80%, respectively. This study demonstrated that the hyperspectral plant  sensing approach could be developed to differentiate GR johnsongrass from  glyphosate-sensitive GS johnsongrass with the highest classification accuracy of  77%. The comparison with our previous studies indicated that the similar  hyperspectral approach could be used and transferred from classification across  different GR and GS weed biotypes, such as Palmer amaranth, Italian ryegrass and  johnsongrass, so it is highly possible for classification of more other GR and GS  weed biotypes as well. On the basis of classic pattern recognition approaches the  process of plant classification can be enhanced by modeling using machine  learning algorithms. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

Fish is a  staple and affordable food source, rich in animal protein, along with various  vitamins, essential amino acids, and minerals. Exposure of fish to microplastics,  pesticides, and various nanoparticles generates ROS and induces oxidative stress,  inflammation, immunotoxicity, genotoxicity, and DNA damage and alters gut  microbiota, thus reducing the growth and quality of fish. Changes in fish  behavioral patterns, swimming, and feeding habits were also observed under  exposures to the above contaminants.

Oil, heavy  metals, agrochemicals, sewage, medical wastes, plastics, algal blooms,  atmospheric pollutants, mariculture-related pollutants, as well as thermal and  noise pollution are the most threatening marine pollutants. The release of these  pollutants into the marine aquatic environment leads to significant ecological  degradation and a range of non-infectious disorders in fish. Marine pollutants  trigger numerous fish bacterial diseases by increasing microbial multiplication  in the aquatic environment and suppressing fish immune defense mechanisms. The  greater part of these microorganisms is naturally occurring in the aquatic  environment. Most disease outbreaks are caused by opportunistic bacterial agents  that attack stressed fish. Some infections are more serious and occur in the  absence of environmental stressors. Gram-negative bacteria are the most frequent  causes of these epizootics, while gram-positive bacterial agents rank second on  the critical pathogens list. Vibrio spp., Photobacterium damselae subsp.

Despite the benefits of aquaculture, the  rapid growth and intensification of production (so-called conventional  aquaculture) has raised concerns about food safety, fish welfare, and  environmental and social issues stemming from a tragedy of the commons. These  concerns need to be addressed to enable sustainable aquaculture development.  While the negative environmental impacts of aquaculture have been evaluated using  physical and chemical indicators, the social acceptance has not been fully  considered when evaluating aquaculture sustainability. With this backdrop, our  study investigates knowledge and beliefs towards shrimp aquaculture development  among two key stakeholder groups in Vietnam: the public and producers (shrimp  farmers). Our results show that stakeholders were concerned about the social and  environmental impacts of conventional shrimp aquaculture, although the different  stakeholder groups emphasized different aspects. The public believed biodiversity  loss and the overuse of antibiotics and pesticides to be more problematic  compared to producers, who believed water quality and disease outbreaks were the  main problems facing the industry. Following on from this, most respondents  perceived sustainable aquaculture production positively, implying social  acceptability for its development.

While  fenpropathrin was found to have neurotoxic effects in mammals, it remains unclear  whether it has similar effects on fish. Here, we used adult zebrafish to  investigate the impacts of fenpropathrin on fish social behaviors and neural  activity. Exposure of adult zebrafish to 500 ppb of fenpropathrin for 72 h  increased anxiety levels but decreased physical fitness, as measured by a novel  tank diving test and swimming tunnel test. Fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared  to spend more time in the conspecific zone of the tank, possibly seeking greater  comfort from their companions. Although learning, memory, and aggressive behavior  did not change, fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to have shorter fighting  durations. The immunocytochemical results showed the tyrosine hydroxylase  antibody-labeled dopaminergic neurons in the teleost posterior tuberculum  decreased in the zebrafish brain.

Separated from other neurotoxins, ROT induces a  Parkinson’s disease (PD)-related phenotype that mimics the associated clinical  spectrum by directly entering the central nervous system (CNS). It easily crosses  through the blood−brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in mitochondria.  Unfortunately, most of the existing data focus on locomotion. This is why the  present study aimed to bring novel evidence on how ROT alone or in combination  with different potential ant(agonists) might influence the social and aggressive  behavior using the counterclockwise rotation as a neurological pointer. Material  and Methods: Thus, we exposed zebrafish to ROT—2.5 µg/L, valproic acid (VPA)—0.5  mg/mL, anti-parkinsonian drugs (LEV/CARB)—250 mg + 25 mg, and probiotics  (PROBIO)—3 g for 32 days by assessing the anti-social profile and mirror tests  and counterclockwise rotation every 4 days to avoid chronic stress. Results: We  observed an abnormal pattern in the counterclockwise rotation only in the (a)  CONTROL, (c) LEV/CARB, and (d) PROBIO groups, from both the top and side views,  this indicating a reaction to medication and supplements administered or a normal  intrinsic feature due to high levels of stress/anxiety (p < 0.05). Four out of  eight studied groups—(b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, (e) ROT, and (f) ROT + VPA—displayed  an impaired, often antithetical behavior demonstrated by long periods of time on  distinct days spent on the right and the central arm (p < 0.05, 0.005, and  0.0005). Interestingly, groups (d) PROBIO, (g) ROT + LEV/CARB, and (h) ROT +  PROBIO registered fluctuations but not significant ones in contrast with the  above groups (p > 0.05). Except for groups (a) CONTROL and (d) PROBIO, where a  normalized trend in terms of behavior was noted, the rest of the experimental  groups exhibited exacerbated levels of aggression (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001)  not only near the mirror but as an overall reaction (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001).  Conclusions: The (d) PROBIO group showed a significant improvement compared with  (b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, and ROT-treated zebrafish (e−h).

They have low toxicity for warm-blooded living creatures, but high toxicity for both insects and fish. Therefore, it is  important to reduce the environmental impact of pyrethroids. Pyrethroic acids are  chiral compounds. An effective way to decrease pollution is to use enantio-pure  insecticide products instead of their racemic mixtures. Enantiomer-pure products  require enantiomer selective synthesis and analysis. The chiral selective  analysis of pyrethroic acids (an intermediate of pyrethroids) is also important  in terms of process control and from the point of view of their degradation  metabolism in the environment. This study used various enantiomeric selective  chromatographic methods for the separation of different pyrethroic acids,  including gas chromatography, supercritical fluid chromatography and capillary  electrophoresis. Systematic experiments were conducted to find the optimum  conditions for their chiral separation.

Studies have shown that this  compound is toxic to a variety of fish species at the concentrations of  environmental relevance. Glyphosate-based herbicides can affect fish biochemical,  physiological, endocrine, and behavioral pathways. Changes in behaviors such as  foraging, escaping from predators, and courtship can compromise the survival of  species and even communities. The behavior patterns of fish has been shown to be  a sensitive tool for risk assessment. In this sense, this review summarizes and  discusses the toxic effects of glyphosate and its formulations on the behavior of  fish in different life stages.

For correct food labelling, the detection and quantification of allergens are necessary. However, novel product  formulations and industrial processes produce new scenarios, which require much  more technological developments. For this purpose, OMICS technologies, especially  proteomics, seemed to be relevant in this context. This review summarises the  current knowledge and studies that used proteomics to study food allergens. In  the case of the allergenic proteins, a wide variety of isoforms,  post-translational modifications and other structural changes during food  processing can increase or decrease the allergenicity. Most of the plant-based  food allergens are proteins with biological functions involved in storage,  structure, and plant defence. The allergenicity of these proteins could be  increased by the presence of heavy metals, air pollution, and pesticides.  Targeted proteomics like selected/multiple reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM) have  been very useful, especially in the case of gluten from wheat, rye and barley,  and allergens from lentil, soy, and fruit. Conventional 1D and 2-DE  immunoblotting have been further widely used. For animal-based food allergens,  the widely used technologies are 1D and 2-DE immunoblotting followed by  MALDI-TOF/TOF, and more recently LC-MS/MS, which is becoming useful to assess  egg, fish, or milk allergens.

The unique structural and functional  attributes provide a nonspecific and versatile means of combating a variety of  microbial pathogens, i.e., fungi, bacteria, protozoa, and enveloped viruses. Some  defensins in plants involved in other functions include the development of metal  tolerance and the role in sexual reproduction, while most of the defensins make  up the innate immune system of the plants. Defensins are structurally and  functionally linked and have been characterized in various eukaryotic  microorganisms, mammals, plants, gulls, teleost species of fish, mollusks, insect  pests, arachnidan, and crustaceans. This defense mechanism has been improved  biotechnologically as it helps to protect plants from fungal attacks in  genetically modified organisms (GMO).

Through a series of laboratory experiments, this study  investigated the impact of exposure to chemical contaminant such as DDT or copper  (Cu), in combination with cold or warm temperature extremes on the marine medaka  fish Oryzias melastigma. The results showed that extreme seawater temperatures  (i.e., 15 and 32 °C in sub-tropical Hong Kong) exacerbated adverse chemical  impacts on the growth performance of O. melastigma, in particular at the high  thermal extreme. This was likely associated with an interruption of oxygen  consumption and aerobic scope. Most importantly, the results of acclimation  experiments, as reflected by thermal tolerance polygons, showed that chemical  exposure substantially narrowed the thermal tolerance of the medaka, making them  more vulnerable to temperature changes and extreme thermal events. Under dual  stresses of thermal extremes and chemical exposure, the medaka switched their  metabolic pathway to anaerobic respiration that might deplete their energy  reserve for chemical detoxification. Although stress proteins such as heat shock  proteins (HSP90) were up-regulated for cellular protection in the fish, such a  defensive mechanism was repressed with intensifying dual stresses at high  temperature and high chemical concentration. Bioconcentration of DDT or Cu  generally increased with increasing temperature and its exposure concentration.  Overall, these complex chemical-temperature interactions concomitantly exerted a  concerted adverse impact to O. melastigma.

The knowledge translation value remains: RCTs and CRCTs  can potentially stimulate changes of practice among stakeholders. Capitalising on  the knowledge translation value of RCTs requires more than the standard reporting  of trials. Those who are convinced by a trial and want to act, need to know how  the trial relates to their own context, what contributed to success, and what  might make it even more effective.

Over this period, the widely-used organochlorines were eventually  replaced by organophosphates, with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and  chlorpyrifos (CPF) as the principal prototypes. Considerable research has  characterized the risks of DDT and CPF individually, but little is known about  the toxicology of transitioning from one class of insecticides to another, as has  been commonplace for agricultural and pest control workers. This study used adult  zebrafish to investigate neurobehavioral toxicity following 5-week chronic  exposure to either DDT or CPF, to or their sequential exposure (DDT for 5 weeks  followed by CPF for 5 weeks). At the end of the exposure period, a subset of fish  were analyzed for brain cholinesterase activity. Behavioral effects were  initially assessed one week following the end of the CPF exposure and again at  14 months of age using a behavioral test battery covering sensorimotor responses,  anxiety-like functions, predator avoidance and social attraction. Adult  insecticide exposures, individually or sequentially, were found to modulate  multiple behavioral features, including startle responsivity, social approach,  predator avoidance, locomotor activity and novel location recognition and  avoidance. Locomotor activity and startle responsivity were each impacted to a  greater degree by the sequential exposures than by individual compounds, with the  latter being pronounced at the early (1-week post exposure) time point, but not  3-4 months later in aging. Social approach responses were similarly impaired by  the sequential exposure as by CPF-alone at the aging time point. Fleeing  responses in the predator test showed flee-enhancing effects of both compounds  individually versus controls, and no additive impact of the two following  sequential exposure. Each compound was also associated with changes in  recognition or avoidance patterns in a novel place recognition task in late  adulthood, but sequential exposures did not enhance these phenotypes. The  potential for chemical x chemical interactions did not appear related to changes  in CPF metabolism to the active oxon, as prior DDT exposure did not affect the  cholinesterase inhibition resulting from CPF. This study shows that the effects  of chronic adult insecticide exposures may be relevant to behavioral health  initially and much later in life, and that the effects of sequential exposures  may be unpredictable based on their constituent exposures.",2021-10,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,106985,,,87,,Neurotoxicol Teratol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, ATZ effects on  hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis key genes expression and early gonadal  development were evaluated in Odontesthes bonariensis larvae waterborne exposed  during the gonadal differentiation period. Fish were treated to 0, 0.7, 7.0, and  70 µg ATZ/L at 25 °C from the 2nd to 6th week after hatching (wah), and a group  was kept in clean water until the 12th wah. Parallelly, a group was submitted to  0.05 µg/L of ethinylestradiol (EE(2)) as a positive estrogenic control. From each  treatment, eight larvae were sampled at 6 wah for gene expression analysis and  twelve larvae at 12 wah for phenotypic sex histological determination. The  expression of gnrh1, lhb, fshb, and cyp19a1b was assessed in the head, and the  ones of amha, 11βhsd2, and cyp19a1a in the trunk.

A decrease in  reproduction success is one of the most well-documented signs of endocrine  disruption in fish. Estrogens are steroid hormones involved in the control of  important reproduction-related processes, including sexual differentiation,  maturation and a variety of others. Careful spatial and temporal balance of  estrogens in the body is crucial for proper functioning. At the final step of  estrogen biosynthesis, cytochrome P450 aromatase, encoded by the cyp19 gene,  converts androgens into estrogens. Modulation of aromatase CYP19 expression and  function can dramatically alter the rate of estrogen production, disturbing the  local and systemic levels of estrogens. In the present review, the current  progress in CYP19 characterization in teleost fish is summarized and the  potential of several classes of EDCs to interfere with CYP19 expression and  activity is discussed. Two cyp19 genes are present in most teleosts, cyp19a and  cyp19b, primarily expressed in the ovary and brain, respectively. Both aromatase  CYP19 isoforms are involved in the sexual differentiation and regulation of the  reproductive cycle and male reproductive behavior in diverse teleost species.  Alteration of aromatase CYP19 expression and/or activity, be it upregulation or  downregulation, may lead to diverse disturbances of the above mentioned  processes. Prediction of multiple transcriptional regulatory elements in the  promoters of teleost cyp19 genes suggests the possibility for several EDC classes  to affect cyp19 expression on the transcriptional level. These sites include cAMP  responsive elements, a steroidogenic factor 1/adrenal 4 binding protein site, an  estrogen-responsive element (ERE), half-EREs, dioxin-responsive elements, and  elements related to diverse other nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator  activated receptor, retinoid X receptor, retinoic acid receptor). Certain  compounds including phytoestrogens, xenoestrogens, fungicides and organotins may  modulate aromatase CYP19 activity on the post-transcriptional level. As is shown  in this review, diverse EDCs may affect the expression and/or activity of  aromatase cyp19 genes through a variety of mechanisms, many of which need further  characterization in order to improve the prediction of risks posed by a  contaminated environment to teleost fish population.",01/01/2008,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,31-62,,1,155,,Gen Comp Endocrinol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 17459383,,,,"*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Animals; Antifungal Agents/pharmacology; Aromatase/*genetics/physiology; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/physiology; Endocrine Disruptors/*toxicity; Enzyme Activation/drug effects; Estradiol Congeners/pharmacology; Fishes/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology; Organotin Compounds/pharmacology; Phytoestrogens/pharmacology; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/physiology; Reproduction/*drug effects/genetics; Sexual Behavior, Animal/drug effects",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

D.",DIRS-1 and the other tyrosine recombinase retrotransposons.,Cytogenetic and genome research,,1424-859X 1424-8581,10.1159/000084991,,"DIRS-1 is a retroelement from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Until recently only two related retrotransposons had been described: PAT from the  nematode Panagrellus redivivus and Prt1 from the zygomycete fungus Phycomyces  blakesleeanus. Analyses of the reverse transcriptase sequences encoded by these  three elements suggested that they were closely related to each other and more  distantly related to the Ty3/gypsy Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retroelements. They  have several unusual structural features that distinguish them from typical LTR  elements. For instance, they each encode a tyrosine recombinase (YR), but not a  DDE-type integrase or an aspartic protease. Although the DIRS-1-related elements  are bordered by terminal repeats these differ from typical LTRs in a number of  ways. In DIRS-1, for example, the terminal repeats are inverted (complementary),  non-identical in sequence, and the outer edges of the terminal sequences are  repeated (adjacent to each other) in the internal region. PAT has so-called  ""split"" direct repeats in which the unrelated terminal sequences appear as direct  repeats adjacent to each other in the internal region. The only repetition  displayed by Prt1 is the presence of short inverted terminal repeats, but the  sequenced copy of this element is believed to be a truncated version of an  element with a structure resembling DIRS-1. The unusual structure of the terminal  repeats of the DIRS1-like elements appears to be related to their replication via  free circular intermediates. Site-specific recombination is believed to integrate  the circle without creating duplications of the target sites. In recognition of  these important distinctions it is proposed that the retrotransposons that encode  tyrosine recombinases be called the tyrosine recombinase (or YR)  retrotransposons. Recently a large number of additional YR retrotransposons have  been described, including elements from fungi (zygomycetes and basidiomycetes),  plants (green algae) and a wide range of animals including nematodes, insects,  sea urchins, fish and amphibia, while remnants of elements related to DIRS-1  occur in the human genome. The complete set of YR retrotransposons can be divided  into two major groups, the DIRS elements and the Ngaro elements, the two groups  forming distinct clades on phylogenetic trees based on alignments of RT/RH and  recombinase sequences, and also having some structural distinctions. A third  group of transposable elements, which we call Cryptons, also carry tyrosine  recombinases. These elements do not encode a reverse transcriptase and so are  believed to be DNA transposons not retrotransposons. They have been detected in  several pathogenic fungi, including the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans,  and the ascomycetes Coccidioides posadasii and Histoplasma capsulatum. Sequence  comparisons suggest that the Crypton YRs are related to those of the YR  retrotransposons. We suggest that the YR retrotransposons arose from the  combination of a Crypton-like YR DNA transposon and the RT/RH encoding sequence  of a retrotransposon.",2005,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,575-588,,01-Apr,110,,Cytogenet Genome Res,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 16093711,,,,"*Retroelements; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Invertebrates/genetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Recombinases/*genetics; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Vertebrates/genetics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Toxicity originates during the metabolization  process, which may produce toxic metabolites or reactive oxygen species (ROS).  Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase  (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and levels of reduced glutathione  (GSH) indicate toxicants interacted with drug-metabolizing and antioxidant  systems, i.e., they are biomarkers of biotransformation and oxidative stress. We  meta-analytically quantified the impact of pesticides on the mean response and  variability of these biomarkers. Our goals were to verify (i) the overall effect  of pesticides on oxidative stress and biotransformation, and how each biomarker  respond to exposure; (ii) how the life stage of fish (juvenile and adult)  influence biomarkers variability and mean activity; (iii) to what extent fish sex  (male, female or mixed-sex groups) modify pesticides toxicity; (iv) how different  classes of pesticides, and the combination of their concentration and time of  exposure, affect each biomarker. Overall, pesticides induced oxidative stress and  the biotransformation system. Regardless of life stage, EROD mean activity  increased significantly. In exposed juveniles, CAT and GST variability decreased  and increased, respectively. CAT mean activity was higher in females, while EROD  and GST activities increased in males after pesticide exposure. Organophosphorus  (OPs) and organochlorine insecticides, along with imidazole and triazole  fungicides, affected biomarkers the most, however the combined effect of  concentration and time of exposure of OPs was not detected. Notably, imidazoles  and triazoles classes increased EROD by more than 100%. Additionally, we  identified research gaps, such as the lack of effect estimates of relevant  pesticides on EROD (e.g., pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) and the small number of  studies evaluating GSH on female fish.

Excessive and unrestricted use of pesticides is the most  serious threat to aquatic animals including amphibians and fishes. Among the  known pesticides, glyphosate based formulations have been shown to have lethal  effects on many aquatic organisms. However, negative effects of pesticides on  crucial ecological interactions such as prey-predator interactions are relatively  unknown from tropics. In many aquatic organisms, recognition of predators is  based on odor signatures; and therefore any anthropogenic alteration in water  chemistry has the potential to impair recognition and learning of predators.  Through a series of behavioral experiments we evaluated the effect of glyphosate  based herbicide (Roundup®) on the antipredator behavior of common spiny loach,  Lepidocephalichthys thermalis to understand the effects of pesticide-exposure on  recognition of conspecific alarm cues, and associative learning to avoid  predation. We exposed common spiny loach (for 3 h or 15 days) to sub-lethal  concentration (0.5 mg a.e./L) of Roundup® and subsequently with conspecific alarm  cues, signaling the proximity of a predator. Unexposed prey fish showed a  significant reduction in activity level in response to conspecific alarm cues.  Whereas such alarm response was not observed in prey fish that were exposed to  Roundup® either for 3 h or 15 days. Such lack of response could be associated  with alteration of olfactory function in prey individuals. However, this  inability to detect the conspecific alarm cues was found to be transient and  exposed fish recovered within 2 days. In subsequent experiments, we showed that  Roundup® deactivates the conspecific alarm cues thus making them unavailable for  prey to evoke the response. Furthermore, Roundup® mediated degradation of  conspecific alarm cues and diminished the associative learning necessary for  detection of the invasive/unknown/novel predators. Overall, due to the worldwide  occurrence of glyphosate in water bodies, glyphosate mediated behavioral  suppression exposes the prey animals to a considerable risk of predation, both by  native and non-native predators.",2019-03,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,189-200,,2,28,,Ecotoxicology,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 30632094,,,,"Animals; Association Learning/*drug effects; Chemical cues; Cues; Cypriniformes/*physiology; Food Chain; Glycine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives; Glyphosate; Herbicides/*adverse effects; Learning; Olfactory Perception/*drug effects; Pesticides; Recognition, Psychology/*drug effects; Sub-lethal; Tilapia; Time Factors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The long-range goal is to  gain sufficient understanding of fish metabolic transformation reactions to be  able to accurately predict fish xenobiotic metabolism. While some metabolism data  exist, there are few fish in vivo exposure studies where metabolites have been  identified and the metabolic pathways proposed. Previous biotransformation work  has focused on in vitro studies which have the advantage of high throughput but  may have limited metabolic capabilities, and in vivo studies which have full  metabolic capacity but are low throughput. An aquatic model system with full  metabolic capacity in which a large number of chemicals could be tested would be  a valuable tool. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study evaluated the ex vivo  rainbow trout liver slice model, which has the advantages of high throughput as  found in vitro models and non-dedifferentiated cells and cell to cell  communication found in in vivo systems. The pesticide diazinon, which has been  previously tested both in vitro and in vivo in a number of mammalian and aquatic  species including rainbow trout, was used to evaluate the ex vivo slice model as  a tool to study biotransformation pathways. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: While somewhat  limited by the analytical chemistry method employed, results of the liver slice  model, mainly that hydroxypyrimidine was the major diazinon metabolite, are in  line with the results of previous rainbow trout in vivo studies. CONCLUSION:  Therefore, the rainbow trout liver slice model is a useful tool for the study of  metabolism in aquatic species.",01/03/2018,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,13-23,,1,4,,Appl In Vitro Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 30956994  PMCID: PMC6446237,,,,biotransformation; diazinon; liver slices; metabolism; trout,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data on dietary habits of the mothers, as well as health-related  social, occupational and environmental exposures prior to and during the index  birth, were collected through interviews. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) were  calculated by logistic regression after adjustment for confounding variables.  Increased ORs were observed for mothers of children with hypospadias who, during  pregnancy, frequently consumed fish (OR = 2.33 [95% confidence interval (CI)  1.03, 5.31]) and market-purchased fruit (OR = 5.10 [95% CI 1.31, 19.82]).

The effects of diuron on fish behaviour are currently  poorly understood. Herein, the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) was  continuously exposed to environmentally realistic levels of diuron from the  fertilised egg stage to the adult stage. Behavioural evaluation of adult marine  medaka indicated that exposure to diuron increased anxiety in the light-dark test  and increased predator avoidance. In addition, diuron exposure significantly  reduced aggression, social interaction, shoaling, and learning and memory  ability. However, only negligible variations in foraging behaviour and in  behaviour in the novel tank test were observed. Marine medaka chronically exposed  to diuron also showed decreased levels of dopamine in the brain, and changes were  observed in the transcription of genes related to dopamine synthesis, degradation  and receptors. Exposure to 5000 ng/L diuron caused significant downregulation of  the expression of the genes of tyrosine hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase and  significantly upregulated the expression of the genes of the D(5) dopaminergic  receptor. The relative expression of the D(4) dopaminergic receptor was  significantly upregulated in the 50, 500 and 5000 ng/L diuron-treated groups.

To evaluate the  mixture toxicity, LC(10) and LC(50) concentrations were grouped into four  combinations as ENDO-LC(10) + PHE-LC(10), ENDO-LC(10) + PHE-LC(50),  ENDO-LC(50) + PHE-LC(10), and ENDO-LC(50) + PHE-LC(50), and their acute  toxicities were determined. The combination of LC(50)-ENDO and LC(10)-PHE  exhibited a synergistic effect. In addition, acetylcholinesterase activity  decreased in zebrafish bodies exposed to ENDO with or without PHE. Combined  treatments induced higher glutathione S-transferase activity compared to  individual treatments. Carboxylesterase activity increased in both heads and  bodies of ENDO-treated fishes compared with PHE-treated fishes. Using RT-qPCR  technique, CYP1A gene expression significantly up-regulated in all combinations,  whereas CYP3A was unchanged, suggesting that enzymes involved in defense may play  different roles in the detoxification. CYP7A1 gene responsible for bile acid  biosynthesis is dramatically down-regulated after exposure to the synergistic  combination exposure, referring that the synergistic effect may be resulted from  the reduction of bile production in zebrafishes. Among gender-related genes,  CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 genes in female zebrafish decreased after treatment with ENDO  alone and combination of LC(50)-ENDO and LC(10)-PHE. This might be related to a  reduction in cortisol production.

In addition, paraquat can be accumulated in human  body through various approaches and have an increased risk for Parkinson's  disease. However, the specific role and mechanism of lncRNA related to neurotoxic  in the progression of PD is unclear. In our study, a mouse PD model was  established induced by the intraperitoneal injection of paraquat (5 mg/kg and  10 mg/kg) every three days (10 times). We determined differential expression of  lncRNA AK039862 and its potential targeted genes Pafah1b1/Foxa1 in PD mouse  model, then we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to visualize the  cellular distribution of AK039862. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and  overexpression plasmids were designed for knockdown or overexpression of  AK039862. To simulate the coexisting dopaminergic cells and microglia cells in  vitro, we applied several non-contact co-culture models, including conditioned  medium and Transwell co-culture systems. Cytotoxicity of PQ was evaluated using  bv2 cells with the concentrations: 30, 60 μM, and mn9d cells with the  concentrations: 50, 100 μM. As a result, we depicted multiple interesting  individual and interactive features of inflammatory lncRNA AK039862 involved in  PQ-induced cellular functional effects. First, we detected that AK039862  contributed to the neuronal injury process in PQ-treated mice and co-localization  of AK039862 with dopaminergic cells in vivo. And interestingly, we demonstrated  that PQ significantly inhibited microglia and dopaminergic cells proliferation  and microglia migration in vitro. Further research indicated that the PQ-induced  low expression of AK039862 rescued microglia proliferation and migration  inhibition via the AK039862/Pafah1b1/Foxa1 pathway. Meanwhile, AK039862 also  participated in the interaction between microglia and dopaminergic cells with PQ  treatment in non-contact co-culture models. In summary, we found that PQ  inhibited the proliferation and migration of microglial cells, and elucidated  AK039862 played a key role in PQ-induced neuroinflammatory damage through  Pafah1b1/Foxa1.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio), Japanese medaka (Oryzias  latipes) and Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) are popular freshwater  animal models. However, their behavioral use in aquatic toxicology research is  generally hampered by oversimplified behavioral tasks and the fact that they are  not well-developed animal models for toxicology. Here, this study presented a  comparative analysis of multiple behavioral traits (i.e., anxiety-like behavior,  novel object recognition, social preferences, habituation to light-dark stimulus  and noise stimulus, and spatial learning and memory). We found that only medaka  (d-rR) presented a weak or no response to repeated light-dark stimulus and noise  stimulus. In addition, no significant behavioral changes were observed for the  three species of juvenile fish models after 7 days of exposure to 0.01% v/v  carrier solvents (i.e., ethanol, acetone, and DMSO). In contrast to zebrafish and  Chinese rare minnow, medaka showed no significant changes in spatial memory after  subacute exposure to 1 mg/L imidacloprid or 2.5 μg/L chlorpyrifos (cpf); instead,  a hyperactivity response in the open field test and reduced social time were  induced by cpf and imidacloprid, respectively. Our results suggest that: (1)  behavioral effects are negligible when using <0.01% v/v carrier solvents for  behavioral assessment; (2) given the differences in sensitivities of behavioral  responses, a single behavior used alone as an endpoint may be insufficient for  estimating the toxic impacts of pesticides or other environmental contaminants.

Early life exposure to EDCs may permanently alter  phenotypes through to adulthood. In addition, the effects of EDCs may not be  isolated to a single generation - offspring may indirectly be impacted, via  non-genetic processes. Here, we analyzed the effects of paternal atrazine  exposure on behavioral traits (distance moved, exploration, bottom-dwelling time,  latency to enter the top zone, and interaction with a mirror) and whole-brain  mRNA of genes involved in the serotonergic system regulation (slc6a4a, slc6a4b,  htr1Aa, htr1B, htr2B) of zebrafish (Danio rerio). F0 male zebraFIsh were exposed  to atrazine at 0.3, 3 or 30 part per billion (ppb) during early juvenile  development, the behavior of F1 progeny was tested at adulthood, and the effect  of 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment on mRNA transcription was quantified. Paternal  exposure to atrazine significantly reduced interactions with a mirror (a proxy  for aggression) and altered the latency to enter the top zone of a tank in  unexposed F1 offspring. Bottom-dwelling time (a proxy for anxiety) also appeared  to be somewhat affected, and activity (distance moved) was reduced in the context  of aggression. slc6a4a and htr1Aa mRNA transcript levels were found to correlate  positively with anxiety levels in controls, but we found that this relationship  was disrupted in the 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment group. Overall, paternal atrazine  exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behavioral traits and showed  signs of serotonergic system dysregulation, demonstrating intergenerational  effects.

Here, we studied how  glyphosate affects several haematological, biochemical, and immune parameters in  common carp (Cyprinus carpio) fingerlings, the fourth most important cultured  fish species worldwide. We also evaluated the potential of dietary  supplementation with black seed (Nigella sativa, 0.25, 0.5 and 1%) to lower  glyphosate-associated toxicity. Our results showed that 14-day sub-lethal  exposure of common carp fingerlings to glyphosate increases oxidative stress,  decreases antioxidant defences, affects several metabolic pathways, and induced  immune depression. Furthermore, we showed that fish fed with N. sativa-enriched  diets at 0.25, 0.5 and 1% for 60 days coped better with glyphosate exposure than  control fish and displayed more stable levels of biochemical serum parameters  (total protein, albumin, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein LDL), cholesterol  and high-density lipoprotein HDL), higher levels of immune defences (lysozyme and  immunoglobulin) and higher antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase SOD,  glutathione peroxidase GPx) than control fish. Fish fed with all enriched diets  also displayed lower lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde MDA), lower metabolic  enzymes (alanine aminotransferase ALT, aspartate aminotransferase AST and  alkaline phosphatase ALP) levels in blood serum and lower cortisol levels than  control fish. Altogether, our results show that dietary inclusion of black seed  can be used as a sustainable bio-remediation strategy, mitigating many of the  negative effects of glyphosate exposure in fish.",2021-02,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,Dec-19,,,109,,Fish Shellfish Immunol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

One  component frequently found in current products against harmful species to crops  is rotenone whose effect under prolonged exposure has been demonstrated to cause  neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The latest reports have  indeed revealed that rotenone promotes Parkinson's in humans, but studies aiming  to show congruent effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio) are lacking. Material and  Methods. In this context, the aim of the present study was to demonstrate how  chronic administration of rotenone for 3 weeks impairs the locomotor activity and  sociability and induces oxidative stress in zebrafish. RESULTS: There were no  statistically significant differences following the analysis of their social  interaction and locomotor tests (p > 0.05). However, several exceptions have been  noted in the control, rotenone, and probiotics groups when we compared their  locomotor activity during the pretreatment and treatment interval (p < 0.05). We  further assessed the role of rotenone in disturbing the detoxifying system as  represented by three enzymes known as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione  peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Despite the fact that there were no  statistically significant changes within SOD and GPx levels between the control  group and rotenone, probiotics, and rotenone + probiotics (p > 0.05), relevant  changes have been observed between the analyzed groups (p < 0.05 and p < 0.005,  respectively). On the other hand, significant differences (p < 0.05) have been  observed for MDA when we analyzed the data between the control group and the  other three groups.

Cladocerans, i.e. zooplankton that plays an important  role in the energy flow and material circulation in freshwater ecosystem, usually  develop induced defense in response to predation risk. We used atrazine, one of  the most used herbicides in the world, and Daphnia pulex, a representative  cladocerans, to test the possible interference effect of herbicides on the  induced defensive traits of cladocerans in response to predator fish (Rhodeus  ocellatus) kairomone, including morphological defense, life history strategies,  and the expression of defense-related genes.

Exposure to atrazine affected the expression of defense-related genes,  and we speculated that atrazine affected the signaling process in the induced  anti-predation defense of cladocerans.

Olfactory function of  juvenile chinook salmon was evaluated in two separate experiments following 2-h  immersion exposures to 0, 1, 10, or 100 microg diazinon/L. In the first test  system, groups of 10 salmon were transferred to the prechoice zone of a Y-maze  fluviarium with parallel streams of water. A dilute alarm scent composed of  either chinook skin extract or L-serine was pumped into the water supply of one  arm. Fish were allowed to choose either upstream arm by raising a containment  screen for 10 min, then their positions were photographed and the screen lowered.  In the second test system the relationship of diazinon exposure to predation  susceptibility was directly examined by transferring groups of 20 salmon (10  diazinon-exposed, 10 control) to troughs containing a protective cover. These  salmon were given two olfactory warnings by delivering conspecific skin extract  to both their transfer container and the predation tank they entered. After a  2-min prey acclimation period, larger predator rainbow trout were allowed access  to the downstream section of the tank containing the test salmon.

Experimental animal studies complement epidemiological studies to  help determine the cause-and-effect relationship between chronic adult  insecticide exposure and behavioral dysfunction. With the zebrafish model, we  examined short and long-term neurobehavioral effects of exposure to either an  organochlorine insecticide, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or an  organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF). Adult fish were exposed  continuously for either two or 5 weeks (10-30 nM DDT, 0.3-3 μM CPF), with short-  and long-term effects assessed at 1-week post-exposure and at 14 months of age  respectively. The behavioral test battery included tests of locomotor activity,  tap startle, social behavior, anxiety, predator avoidance and learning. Long-term  effects on neurochemical indices of cholinergic function were also assessed. Two  weeks of DDT exposure had only slight effects on locomotor activity, while a  longer five-week exposure led to hypoactivity and increased anxiety-like diving  responses and predator avoidance at 1-week post-exposure. When tested at  14 months of age, these fish showed hypoactivity and increased startle responses.  Cholinergic function was not found to be significantly altered by DDT. The  two-week CPF exposure led to reductions in anxiety-like diving and increases in  shoaling responses at the 1-week time point, but these effects did not persist  through 14 months of age. Nevertheless, there were persistent decrements in  cholinergic presynaptic activity. A five-week CPF exposure led to long-term  effects including locomotor hyperactivity and impaired predator avoidance at  14 months of age, although no effects were apparent at the 1-week time point.  These studies documented neurobehavioral effects of adult exposure to chronic  doses of either organochlorine or organophosphate pesticides that can be  characterized in zebrafish.

The role of Petroselinum crispum essential oil  (PEO) supplementation in mitigating the resulted neurotoxic insult was also  investigated. The acute toxicity study revealed that the 96-h LC(50) of BF is  6.81 μg/L, and varying degrees of behavioral changes were recorded in a  dose-dependent manner. The subchronic study revealed reduction of dissolved  oxygen and increased ammonia in aquaria of BF-exposed fish. Clinical signs  revealed high degree of discomfort and aggressiveness together with reductions in  survival rate and body weight gain. The levels of monoamines in brain, and GABA  and amino acids in serum were reduced, together with decreased activities of  Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and acetylcholine esterases (AchE). The activities of  antioxidant enzymes were also diminshed in the brain while oxdative damage and  DNA breaks were elevated. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in serum increased with  overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain tissue. BF also  upregulated the expression of brain-stress related genes HSP70, Caspase-3 and  P53.

There is now clear evidence of associations between exposure to  pollutants and greater susceptibility to pathogens. The aim of the present study  was to characterize the defense capacities of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus  mykiss), chronically exposed to pendimethalin (PD), to subsequent experimental  challenge with the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). Immunological  responses were examined at different organizational levels, from individuals to  gene expression. No negative effects of PD were noted on the Fulton index nor on  the liver or spleen somatic indices (LSI; SSI) before viral infection, but the  infectious stress seems to generate a weak but significant decrease in Fulton and  LSI values, which could be associated with consumption of energy reserves. During  the viral challenges, the distribution of cumulative mortality was slightly  different between infected groups. The impact of the virus on fish previously  contaminated by PD started earlier and lasted longer than controls. The  proportion of seropositive fish was lower in the fish group exposed to PD than in  the control group, with similar quantities of anti-IHNV antibodies secreted in  positive fish, regardless of the treatment. While no significant differences in  C3-1 expression levels were detected throughout the experiment, TNF1&2, TLR3,  Il-1β and IFN expression levels were increased in all infected fish, but the  difference was more significant in fish groups previously exposed to herbicide.  On the other hand, β-def expression was decreased in the pendimethalin-IHNV group  compared to that in fish only infected by the virus (control-IHNV group).",2019-10,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,105282,,,215,,Aquat Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective  study, we included 25 patients (31 eyes) with paraquat-induced ocular surface  injury, who attended the Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University  between October 2008 and October 2013. The patients were split into two groups  according to whether or not received heparin eye drops. The clinical data were  compared between the two groups, i.e. clinical histories, results of  examinations, treatments and outcomes. RESULTS: Eleven patients (group A, 15  eyes) received prompt irrigation with 0.9% saline every two hours, 0.1%  pranoprofen eye drops four times a day, 20% autologous serum every two hours,  recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor eye-gel two times a day, oral  vitamin C 2.0 g and prednisone 30 mg daily. Fourteen patients (group B, 16 eyes)  received additional treatment with heparin eye drops. Ten eyes in group A and  seven eyes in group B developed a pseudomembrane on the ocular surface at  significantly different rate (mean ± SD) of 1.20 ± 1.01 and 0.43 ± 0.51,  respectively (t = 2.66, p = 0.01). Seven eyes among 10 had a pseudomembrane  reoccurred in group A while none had a pseudomembrane reoccurred in group B  (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.01). No significant differences were seen in the  duration of epithelial recovery between the two groups: 15.13 ± 5.13 days in  group A and 16.81 ± 5.56 days in group B (t = 0.87, p = 0.39).

In this article, we provided an overview of recent studies addressing  human health effects of methylmercury, which we searched using the PubMed of the  US National Library of Medicine. The following suggestions were obtained for  low-level methylmercury exposure: (1) In recent years, the proportion of human  studies addressing methylmercury has tended to decrease. (2) Prenatal exposure to  methylmercury through fish intake, even at low levels, adversely affects child  development after adjusting for polychlorinated biphenyls and maternal fish  intake during pregnancy, whereas maternal seafood intake has some benefits.

The  values of reduced glutathione (GSH) and total antioxidant capacity (FRAP) in the  liver tissue were significantly decreased due to permethrin administration.  Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between MDA  concentration and ALT, AST and LDH activities in the permethrin groups,  suggesting that the enhanced lipid peroxidation may be linked to hepatic damage  caused by permethrin. On the other hand, treatment with vitamin C in the PTN-0.64  + Vit.

These effects at the encephalic level appear to derive from the  interference of major signaling factors such as histamine (HA) neuroreceptor  subtypes (H(1-4)R). HA is one of the main biogenic amine neuronal system  responsible for regulatory homeostatic functions, including sleep-wake rhythms  and motor activities. Recently, interests have begun to focus attention on toxic  effects of some heavy metals, i.e., cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), and how they are  capable of eliciting motor dysfunctions via HAergic receptor subtypes.  Interestingly, subtype 2 (H(2)R) proved to be a preferential target of heavy  metal-dependent altered locomotor maneuvers, as displayed by its specific  antagonist (cimetidine)-inducing non-synchronous swimming activities (Santos et  al., 2003, Pharmacol Biochem Behav 75:25-33). Conversely, although the  preferential H(3)R antagonist (thioperamide) did not interfere with normal  swimming behaviors, it surprisingly did ameliorate heavy metal-dependent  hyperactive states (Giusi et al., 2008, Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 227:248-256). In  the case of the xenoestrogens atrazine and endosulfan, their actions tend to  mostly account for feeding alterations through hypothalamic H(3)R-dependent  mechanisms.

A cluster randomized trial assessed  the impact of using biological control tools (guppy fish, pyriproxyfen (PPF), and  Communication for Behavioral Impact (COMBI) activities in combination), which  would be used in a value comparison to traditional chemical control tools. Given  these new intervention methods, a qualitative assessment was designed in order to  represent the quality of understanding, acceptance, and implementation by  participants. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 103 participants in 12  Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and nine In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) were included  in the study. The majority of participants in intervention villages (50 out of  80) preferred guppy fish over other vector control methods due to ease of use and  rearing, quick reproduction and propensity to eat larvae. A substantial number of  participants (11 out of 40) in intervention villages with PPF favored it due to  long-lasting effectiveness, lack of smell and easy maintenance. Participants  showed high demand for both interventions and were willing to pay between 100-500  riel (0.03-0.13 USD). Nearly all participants perceived that the interventions  resulted in a reduction in Aedes mosquitos (both adults and immatures) and dengue  cases. The presence of larvae in the water despite the use of PPF was a source of  concern for some participants, although this was overcome in some cases with  proper health education through health volunteers. Interpersonal communication  through health volunteers was the most favorite method of transmitting prevention  messages. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The community led COMBI strategy resulted in  high acceptance and perceived effectiveness of the interventions in target  villages. Health volunteers are an effective and accepted channel of  communication to engage communities, disseminate information and promote  behavioral change at the household and community level. If shown effective  through corresponding entomological surveys, the interventions should be  continued and further strengthened to ensure they are accessible, available and  affordable.",2019-11,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,e0007907,,11,13,,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 31738759  PMCID: PMC6886868,,,,"*Aedes; *Mosquito Vectors; Adult; Animals; Cambodia; Dengue/*prevention & control; Female; Health Education; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Insecticides/*administration & dosage; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Mosquito Control/*methods; Poecilia/*growth & development; Pyridines/*administration & dosage; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dimoxystrobin is one of the novel strobilurins, recently included in the  3rd Watch List of the European Commission as available data indicate that it  could pose a significant risk to aquatic species. As yet, the number of studies  explicitly assessing the impact of this fungicide on terrestrial and aquatic  species is extremely low, and the toxic effects of dimoxystrobin on fish have not  been reported. Here we investigate for the first time the alterations induced by  two environmentally relevant and very low concentrations of dimoxystrobin (6.56  and 13.13 μg/L) in the fish gills. morphological, morphometric, ultrastructural,  and functional alterations have been evaluated using zebrafish as a model  species. We demonstrated that even short-term exposure (96 h) to dimoxystrobin  alters fish gills reducing the surface available for gas exchange and inducing  severe alterations encompassing three reaction patterns: circulatory disturbance  and both regressive and progressive changes. Furthermore, we revealed that this  fungicide impairs the expression of key enzymes involved in osmotic and acid-base  regulation (Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and AQP3) and the defensive response against  oxidative stress (SOD and CAT). The information presented here highlights the  importance of combining data from different analytical methods for evaluating the  toxic potential of currently used and new agrochemical compounds.

Compared with other types of foods of animal origin, fish contain the  highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-  p-dioxins, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, all of which are classified as  highly toxic organochlorine compounds. Currently, lakes and fish farms in  northern Italy are not regularly monitored for PCBs and dioxins in areas  contaminated by industrial sources, partially because of the high costs of  traditional analytical methods that limit the number of samples to be analyzed.  The DR-CALUX cell bioassay is based on the uptake of the cellular aryl  hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds. The aim of this  study was to assess the levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCB contamination in  Lake Maggiore and Lake Como, two lakes in northwestern Italy, and in nearby  areas.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of this  herbicide on the Neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus. Juvenile fish were  acutely exposed (6, 24 and 96 h) to 1 mg L(-1) of RDT (RDT 1), 5 mg L(-1) of RDT  (RDT 5) or only water (control) and blood samples for hematological analysis,  liver for antioxidants analysis, and brain and muscle for acetylcholinesterase  (AChE) determination, were collected. RDT effects were more evident in fish  exposed to the higher concentration of the herbicide. Hematologic alterations  appeared only after 96 h exposure, when fish showed an increase in the hematocrit  and in the number of both red and white blood cells. After 6h exposure fish  showed a transient reduction in superoxide dismutase and catalase activity. RDT  also inhibited glutathione-S-transferase, after 6 and 24h of exposure. The  reduction in these enzymes is probably related to the occurrence of lipid  peroxidation (LPO) in fish exposed to the herbicide for 6h. LPO returned to  control levels after 24 and 96 h exposure to RDT, when fish showed an increased  activity of glutathione peroxidase. The content of reduced glutathione also  increased after 96 h exposure. Thus, after 24 and 96 h the antioxidant defenses  were apparently enough to combat ROS, preventing the occurrence of oxidative  damage. The exposure to RDT for 96 h led to an inhibition of AChE in brain and  muscle at rates which may not be considered a life-threatening situation.",2010-10,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,781-787,,6,81,,Chemosphere,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Four diets were manufactured:  a control diet (CTRL) was formulated to meet the indispensable amino acids  profile established for seabass. Based on this formulation, three other diets  were supplemented with l-arginine at two different levels (0.5% and 1%, ARG1 and  ARG2, respectively) and l-citrulline at 0.5% (CIT). Fish were fed these diets for  2 or 4 weeks under controlled conditions. At the end of 4 weeks, fish from all  dietary treatments were intraperitoneally-injected with Photobacterium damselae  piscicida and sampled after 4, 24 our 48 h. Immune status was characterized by a  lymphocyte time-dependent decrease regardless of dietary treatment, whereas  peroxidase values dropped in time in fish fed ARG1 and ARG2 and was lower at 4  weeks in fish fed ARG1 than in fish fed CTRL. Up-regulation of several genes was  more evident in ARG1-and CIT-fed fish, though pro-inflammatory cytokines were  down-regulated by CIT dietary treatment. Following immune stimulation, seabass  fed ARG1 showed a decrease in neutrophils and monocytes circulating numbers. On  the other hand, expression of 17 selected immune and inflammatory responses genes  was barely affected by dietary treatments. Based on the analyzed parameters,  results suggest an active role of dietary arginine/citrulline supplementation in  modulating immune defences that seem to translate into a suppressed immune  repertoire, mostly at the cell response level.

However, only few information is available on the GBH effects in the  antioxidant and stress proteins of many other organisms, such as freshwater  crustaceans. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of environmentally  relevant GBH concentrations on the relative transcript expression (RTE) of the  superoxide dismutase (sod1), catalase (cat), selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase (gpx), glutathione-S-transferase (gst), thioredoxin (txn), heat shock  protein (hsp70 and hsp90) in the hepatopancreas of the ecologically important  freshwater prawn Macrobrachium potiuna.

In this study, the zebrafish larvae otic vesicle  microinjection model was used to infect larvae with hemolysin-overexpressing  Edwardsiella piscicida (EthA(+)), and a rapid migration of neutrophils to  infection sites was observed. Intriguingly, EthA(+) infection effectively induced  significant neutrophil membrane rupture in vivo, which was dependent on caspase-B  (caspy2) and gasdermin Eb (GSDMEb) but not caspase-A or gasdermin Ea.  Specifically, the EthA(+) E. piscicida infection induced pyroptosis along with  NETosis in vitro, and depletion of either caspy2 or GSDMEb impaired NET formation  in vivo. Consequently, inhibition of the caspy2-GSDMEb axis-gated NETosis  impaired bacterial clearance in vivo. Altogether, these data provide evidence  that teleost fish innate immune cells, including neutrophils, express features of  pyroptosis that are critical for NETosis in teleost innate immunity.",15/04/2021,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,1913-1922,,8,206,,J Immunol,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2021 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.",,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 33712519,,,,"Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Caspases/genetics; Cells, Cultured; Edwardsiella/*physiology; Enterobacteriaceae Infections/*immunology; Extracellular Traps/*immunology; Fish Diseases/*immunology; Hemolysin Proteins/genetics; Immunity, Innate; Larva; Neutrophils/*immunology; Pyroptosis; Receptors, Estrogen/genetics; Zebrafish Proteins/genetics; Zebrafish/*immunology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paper forms are still often used to register such data.  Manual double data entry (DDE) has been defined as the gold standard for  transferring data to an electronic format but is laborious and costly. Automated  form processing (AFP) is an alternative, but validation in a clinical context is  warranted. The study objective was to examine and validate a local hospital AFP  setup. METHODS: Patients over 18 years of age who were scheduled for knee or hip  replacement at Stavanger University Hospital from 2014 to 2017 who answered PROMs  were included in the study and contributed PROM data. All paper PROMs were  scanned using the AFP techniques of optical mark recognition (OMR) and  intelligent character recognition (ICR) and were processed by DDE by health  secretaries using a data entry program. OMR and ICR were used to capture  different types of data. The main outcome was the proportion of correctly entered  numbers, defined as the same response recorded in AFP and DDE or by consulting  the original paper questionnaire at the data field, item, and PROM level.  RESULTS: A total of 448 questionnaires from 255 patients were analyzed. There was  no statistically significant difference in error proportions per 10 000 data  fields between OMR and DDE for data from check boxes (3.52 95% confidence  interval (CI) 2.17 to 5.72 and 4.18 (95% CI 2.68-6.53), respectively P = .61).  The error proportion for ICR (nine errors) was statistically significantly higher  than that for DDE (two errors), that is, 3.53 (95% CI 1.87-6.57) vs 0.78 (95% CI  0.22-2.81) per 100 data fields/items/questionnaires; P = .033. OMR (0.04% errors)  outperformed ICR (3.51% errors; P < .001), Fisher's exact test. CONCLUSIONS: OMR  can produce an error rate that is comparable to that of DDE. In our setup, ICR is  still problematic and is highly dependent on manual validation.

Thus, this study was aimed at evaluating the  effect of an immunobiotic mixture (IM) on the growth performance,  hemato-biochemistry, and immunity of Nile tilapia exposed to subacute  deltamethrin (DMT). Fish were distributed into four groups: groups 1 and 2 were  fed a control diet, while groups 3 and 4 were fed IM. Groups 2 and 4 were exposed  to DMT (15 μg/L) in rearing water. The results revealed that DMT-exposed fish  exhibited significantly lower final body weights, weight gain, specific growth  rate, and survival rate (P < 0.05), while IM feeding resulted in improved growth  performance and survival rate in fish with or without DMT toxicity. After 15 and  30 days, DMT-treated fish showed a significant increase in blood urea and  bilirubin as well as hepatic enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, aspartate  aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase) (P < 0.05), while supplementation  of the IM mixture significantly lowered these levels in Nile tilapia.

Tannic acid (TAN), a  glucosyl compound found in gallnuts, has previously been shown to antagonize  heavy metal toxicity, antioxidant activity, and inflammation. However, it is  unclear whether TAN can antagonize ATR-induced Grass carp hepatocytes  (L8824 cells) cytotoxicity. Therefore, we treated L8824 cells with  3 μg mL(-1) ATR for 24 h to establish a toxic group model. The experimental data  of flow cytometry and AO/EB staining together showed that the ratio of apoptosis  and necrosis in L8824 cells after ATR exposure was significantly higher than that  in the control group. Furthermore, RT-qPCR showed that inflammatory factors  (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, INF-γ) were up-regulated and antimicrobial peptides  (hepcidin, β-defensin and LEAP2) were induced down-regulated in L8824 cells,  leading to immune dysfunction. The measurement results of oxidative  stress-related indicators showed that the levels of ROS and MDA increased after  ATR exposure, the overall anti-oxidative system was down-regulated. Western  blotting confirmed that TNF-α/TNFR 1-related genes were also up-regulated. This  indicates that ATR stimulates oxidative stress in L8824 cells, which in turn  promotes the binding of TNF-α to TNFR 1. In addition, TRADD, FADD, Caspase-3,  P53, RIP1, RIP3 and MLKL were found to be significantly up-regulated by Western  blotting and RT-qPCR. Conditioned after ATR exposure compared to controls. It  indicates that ATR activates apoptosis and necrosis of TNF-α/TNFR 1 pathway by  inducing oxidative stress in L8824 cells. Furthermore, the use of TAN (5 μM)  significantly alleviated the toxic effects of ATR on L8824 cells mentioned above.

C3KZ67A4,bookSection,2024,"Williams, Mollie; Armstrong, Lisa; Sizemore, Daniel C.","Biologic, Chemical, and Radiation Terrorism Review.",StatPearls,,,,,"Terrorism is the intentional use of indiscriminate violence to create fear and terror as a means to achieve an ideological, financial, religious, or political  aim. It is often used against non-combatant targets. Terror tactics may include  biologic, chemical, nuclear, or explosive events. Biologic Bioterrorism is the  intentional release of biological agents to cause illness or death in humans,  animals, or plants. These agents may be bacteria, fungi, toxins, or viruses. They  may be naturally occurring or human-modified. The agents are typically found in  nature, but they may be altered in a laboratory to increase their resistance to  antibiotics, and ability to spread in the environment. Biological and chemical  agents may be spread through the air, food, or water. Terrorists use biological  agents because they are often difficult to detect and illness onset may be  delayed for hours to days increasing dispersal. The challenge with bioweapons is  that they may affect both enemy and friendly forces, and do not discriminate  between combatants and civilians.  In the last 100 years, the United States and  the international community have experienced multiple acts of bioterrorism which  have targeted civilians. World War I: Germany launched a biological sabotage  campaign in France, Romania, Russia, and the United States by infecting horses  and mules with glanders. World War II: Japanese biological weapons attacks in  China, testing botulism, anthrax, and plague. 1972: Two college students, Allen  Schwander and Stephen Pera, were arrested for planning to poison the Chicago  water supply with typhoid bacteria. 1979: Anthrax leak from chemical weapons  research facility, Sverdlosk, Soviet Union. 1984: The Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh  followers in Oregon attempted to affect a local election by infecting doorknobs  and salad bars in restaurants with Salmonella typhimurium bacteria. 1993: Aum  Shinrikyo religious group released anthrax in Tokyo. 2001: Anthrax-laced of  infectious anthrax were delivered to news media offices and the US Congress.  Chemical During World War I there was widespread use of chemical weapons  resulting in many deaths, both military and civilian. The atrocities experienced  on all sides of this conflict led to the 1925 Geneva Protocol, prohibiting the  use of chemical and biological weapons in war. While most modern states are  either signatories to, or voluntarily abide by, this treaty and subsequent United  Nations resolutions, there have been a few instances of chemical weapos use more  recently. Iraqi forces utilized organophosphate neurotoxins against several  targets in 1987-1988 in the war with the Islamic Republic of Iran on both  military and civilan targets. In 2017, the Syrian government was accused of using  nerve agents and chlorine munitions against the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the  ongoing civil war. Nuclear To date, other than the dropping of nuclear bombs by  the United States to end World War II, there have been no acts of nuclear attack  or nuclear terrorism. Nuclear terrorism is an act of terrorism in which a  terrorist organization detonates a nuclear device. The possibility of terrorist  organizations using nuclear is considered plausible as terrorists could acquire a  nuclear weapon. However, despite thefts of small amounts of fissile material,  there is no credible evidence any terrorist group has succeeded in obtaining the  necessary multi-kilogram critical mass amounts of weapons-grade plutonium  required to make a nuclear weapon. Explosive Traditional small-arms munitioins  and improvised explosive devices are among the most common agents used in  terrorist actions. Explosive devices and arms can be stolen or purchased, as was  seen in the 2015 attacks on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. More commonly  they are manufactured as improvised explosive devices and hidden, such as the  1988 Pan Am flight from Lockerbie, Scotland, the 2004 bombings of the Madrid  subway, or the 2013 bombings of the Boston marathon race in the United States.  Terrorism Definitions What is terrorism? What is a mass casualty incident? The  United Nations definition of terrorism describes it as “an anxiety-inspiring  method of repeated violent action, employed by (semi-) clandestine individual,  group, or state actors, for idiosyncratic, criminal, or political reasons,  whereby—in contrast to assassination—the direct targets of violence are not the  main targets.”. The Department of Defense defines terrorism as “the unlawful use  of violence or threat of violence, often motivated by religious, political, or  other ideological beliefs, to instill fear and coerce governments or societies in  pursuit of goals that are usually political.” . The Federal Emergency Management  Agency defines terrorism as “the use of force or violence against persons or  property in violation of the criminal laws of the United States for purposes of  intimidation, coercion, or ransom. Terrorists often use threats to create fear  among the public, to try to convince citizens that their government is powerless  to prevent terrorism, and to get immediate publicity for their cause”. . The US  Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism as “the unlawful use of force and  violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the  civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or  social objectives.”. A mass casualty incident is defined terrorist act that  generates more patients than available resources can manage using routine  procedures. Terrorism is generally considered to be the use of force or violence  outside the law to create fear among citizens with the intent to coerce some sort  of action. Health professionals should be aware bioterrorism is a perfect vehicle  for terrorists to strike fear into the hearts and minds of citizens in the hopes  they will bend the will of the people to support their agendas. All health  professionals need to be prepared for this potentially catastrophic event.",2024-01,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,StatPearls Publishing,Treasure Island (FL),eng,"Copyright © 2024, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",,,,,,PMID: 29630269,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also focused  on three physiological traits from the cellular up to the whole individual level  showing metabolic status of fish (protein concentration in liver and muscle,  hepatosomatic index, and Fulton's condition factor). Individual thermal stress  and low concentrations of pesticides decreased the sediment reworking activity of  fish and entrained metabolic compensation with global depletion in energy stores.  We found that combined chemical and thermal stresses impaired the capacity of  fish to set up an efficient adaptive response.

Sea lamprey populations  were subsequently controlled using an aggressive integrated pest-management  program which employed barriers and traps to prevent sea lamprey from migrating  to their spawning grounds and the use of the piscicides (lampricides)  3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) and niclosamide to eliminate larval sea  lampreys from their nursery streams. Although sea lampreys have not been  eradicated from the Great Lakes, populations have been suppressed to less than  10% of their peak numbers in the mid-1900s. The ongoing use of lampricides  provides the foundation for sea lamprey control in the Great Lakes, one of the  most successful invasive species control programs in the world. Yet, significant  gaps remain in our understanding of how lampricides are taken-up and handled by  sea lampreys, how lampricides exert their toxic effects, and how they adversely  affect non-target invertebrate and vertebrates species. In this review we examine  what has been learned about the uptake, handling and elimination, and the mode of  TFM and niclosamide toxicity in lampreys and in non-target animals, particularly  in the last 10 years. It is now clear that the mode of TFM toxicity is the same  in non-target fishes and lampreys, in which TFM interferes with oxidative  phosphorylation by the mitochondria leading to decreased ATP production.  Vulnerability to TFM is related to abiotic factors such as water pH and  alkalinity, which we propose changes the relative amounts of the bioavailable  un-ionized form of TFM in the gill microenvironment. Niclosamide, which is also a  molluscicide used to control snails in areas prone to schistosomiasis infections  of humans, also likely works by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, but less is  known about other aspects of its toxicology. The effects of TFM include  reductions in energy stores, particularly glycogen and high energy phosphagens.  However, non-target fishes readily recover from sub-lethal TFM exposure as  demonstrated by the rapid restoration of energy stores and clearance of TFM.  Although both TFM and niclosamide are non-persistent in the environment and  critical for sea lamprey control, increasing public and institutional concerns  about pesticides in the environment makes it imperative to explore other means of  sea lamprey control. Accordingly, we also address possible ""next-generation""  strategies of sea lamprey control including genetic tools such as RNA  interference and CRISPR-Cas9 to impair critical physiological processes (e.g.  reproduction, digestion, metamorphosis) in lamprey, and the use of green  chemistry to develop more environmentally benign chemical methods of sea lamprey  control.",2019-06,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,235-252,,,211,,Aquat Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

In  addition, the recorded behavioral alterations may provide a useful tool for  assessing the toxicity of organophosphorous pesticides to aquatic organisms.",2013-06,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,125-130,,1,92,,Chemosphere,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

D.; Rother, Joachim A.; Dewhurst, Charles F.; Lauer, Sasha; King, William J.","Fipronil: environmental fate, ecotoxicology, and human health concerns.",Reviews of environmental contamination and toxicology,,0179-5953,10.1007/978-1-4899-7283-5_1,,"Fipronil is a highly effective, broad-spectrum insecticide with potential value for the control of a wide range of crop, public hygiene, amenity, and veterinary  pests. It can generally be applied at low to very low dose rates to achieve  effective pest control. Application rates vary between 0.6 and 200 g a.i./ha,  depending on the target pest and formulation. It belongs to the phenyl pyrazole  or fiprole group of chemicals and is a potent disrupter of the insect central  nervous system via interference with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA-)  regulated chloride channel. Fipronil degrades slowly on vegetation and relatively  slowly in soil and in water, with a half-life ranging between 36 hr and 7.3 mon  depending on substrate and conditions. It is relatively immobile in soil and has  low potential to leach into groundwater. One of its main degradation products,  fipronil desulfinyl, is generally more toxic than the parent compound and is very  persistent. There is evidence that fipronil and some of its degradates may  bioaccumulate, particularly in fish. Further investigation on bioaccumulation is  warranted, especially for the desulfinyl degradate. The suitability of fipronil  for use in IPM must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In certain situations,  fipronil may disrupt natural enemy populations, depending on the groups and  species involved and the timing of application. The indications are that fipronil  may be incompatible with locust IPM; hence, this possibility requires further  urgent investigation. It is very highly toxic to termites and has severe and  long-lasting negative impacts on termite populations. It thus presents a  long-term risk to nutrient cycling and soil fertility where termites are  ""beneficial"" key species in these ecological processes. Its toxicity to termites  also increases the risk to the ecology of habitats in which termites are a  dominant group, due to their importance as a food source to many higher animals.  This risk has been demonstrated in Madagascar, where two endemic species of  lizard and an endemic mammal decline in abundance because of their food chain  link to termites. Fipronil is highly toxic to bees (LD50 = 0.004 microgram/bee),  lizards [LD50 for Acanthodactylus dumerili (Lacertidae) is 30 micrograms a.i./g  bw], and gallinaceous birds (LD50 = 11.3 mg/kg for Northern bobwhite quail), but  shows low toxicity to waterfowl (LD50 > 2150 mg/kg for mallard duck). It is  moderately toxic to laboratory mammals by oral exposure (LD50 = 97 mg/kg for  rats; LD50 = 91 mg/kg for mice). Technical fipronil is in toxicity categories II  and III, depending on route of administration, and is classed as a nonsensitizer.  There are indications of carcinogenic action in rats at 300 ppm, but it is not  carcinogenic to female mice at doses of 30 ppm. The acute toxicity of fipronil  varies widely even in animals within the same taxonomic groups. Thus,  toxicological findings from results on standard test animals are not necessarily  applicable to animals in the wild. Testing on local species seems particularly  important in determining the suitability of fipronil-based products for  registration in different countries or habitats and the potential associated risk  to nontarget wildlife. Risk assessment predictions have shown that some fipronil  formulations present a risk to endangered bird, fish, and aquatic and marine  invertebrates. Great care should thus be taken in using these formulations where  they may impact any of these endangered wildlife groups. Work in Madagascar has  highlighted field evidence of this risk. The dose levels at which fipronil  produces thyroid cancer in rats are very high and are unlikely to occur under  normal conditions of use. There is also dispute as to whether this is relevant to  human health risk. However, as fipronil is a relatively new insecticide that has  not been in use for long enough to evaluate the risk it may pose to human health,  from data on human exposure to the product, a precautionary approach may be  warranted. The use of some fipronil-based products on domestic animals is not  recommended where handlers spend significant amounts of time grooming or handling  treated animals. In general, it would appear unwise to use fipronil-based  insecticides without accompanying environmental and human health monitoring, in  situations, regions, or countries where it has not been used before, and where  its use may lead to its introduction into the wider environment or bring it into  contact with people. Further work is needed on the impacts of fipronil on  nontarget vertebrate fauna (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) in the  field before the risk to wildlife from this insecticide can be adequately  validated. Further field study of the effects of fipronil on the nutrient cycling  and soil water-infiltration activities of beneficial termites is required to  assess the ecological impacts of the known toxicity of fipronil to these insects.",2003,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,Jan-66,,,176,,Rev Environ Contam Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 12442503,,,,"*Insecticides/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity; *Pyrazoles/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity; Animals; Animals, Wild; Biodegradation, Environmental; Environmental Monitoring/*methods; Humans; Plants/drug effects; Soil Pollutants/analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data suggest that a high consumption of fish may  help prevent T2D. On the other hand, fish might also be a potential source of  environmental contaminants which could potentially be a risk factor for T2D.  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential associations between self-reported T2D  and consumption of locally-harvested fish, dietary long-chain omega-3 fatty acids  (n-3FAs) and persistent organic pollutants intake among adult FNs living on  reserve in Ontario. DESIGN: Data from the First Nations Food Nutrition and  Environment Study, which included a cross-sectional study of 1429 Ontario FNs  adults living in 18 communities across 4 ecozones in 2012 were analyzed. Social  and lifestyle data were collected using household interviews. The consumption of  locally-harvested fish was estimated using a traditional food frequency  questionnaire along with portion size information obtained from 24hr recalls.  Fish samples were analyzed for the presence of contaminants including  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  Dietary intakes of DDE and PCBs were estimated using community-specific levels of  DDE/PCBs in fish species. Multiple logistic regression models adjusted for  potential covariates including age, gender, body mass index, physical activity,  total energy intake, smoking, and education were developed. RESULTS: The  prevalence of T2D in Ontario FNs was 24.4%. A significant positive association  between fish consumption of one portion per week and more and T2D compared to no  fish consumption was found (OR=2.5 (95% CI: 1.38-4.58). Dietary DDE and PCBs  intake was positively associated with T2D (OR=1.09 (95%CI: 1.05-1.75) for DDE and  OR=1.07 (95%CI: 1.004-1.27) for PCBs) per unit increase in DDE/PCBs while n-3-FAs  intake, adjusted for DDE/PCBs intake, showed an inverse effect against T2D among  older individuals (OR=0.86 (95% CI: 0.46-0.99). CONCLUSION: Our results support  previous findings that exposure to DDE and PCBs may increase the risk of T2D.  Elevated levels of contaminants in fish may counteract with potentially  beneficial effects of n-3FAs from fish consumption. However, the overall health  benefits of high consumption of fish with a high n-3 FAs content may outweigh the  adverse effect of contaminants.",2017-07,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,725-737,,,156,,Environ Res,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Observations were also made  to assess the influence of such exposure on the behavioral responses of fish to  the flow of a crude skin extract solution from conspecifics, active in social  chemocommunication and producing alarm behaviors. Additive tests were run to  check the behavioral responses of previously unexposed goldfish to the flow of a  solution of atrazine- or diuron-contaminated water, at three concentrations (0.1,  1, 10 mg/L). Significant burst swimming reactions appeared in response to a 24-h  exposure to atrazine, at the lowest concentration tested (0.5 microgram/L). A  24-h exposure to 5 microgram/L atrazine or diuron was found to induce various  significant behavioral alterations in fish. At this concentration, both  herbicides decreased grouping behavior and atrazine also increased surfacing  activity. Herbicide-exposed fish showed a decreased grouping behavior during the  flow of the skin extract solution. Sheltering was also decreased during the flow  of the biological solution in fish exposed to atrazine. Moreover, fish exposed to  diuron clearly displayed attraction responses to the flow of the skin solution.  Previously unexposed fish showed a significant increase in burst swimming  reactions in response to the flow of a solution of atrazine- or  diuron-contaminated water, at all concentrations tested (0.1, 1, 10 mg/L).  Furthermore, the diuron-contaminated flow was found to be significantly  attractive at the highest concentration. These results indicate that a short-term  exposure to a relatively low concentration (5 microgram/L) of atrazine or diuron  can affect various behaviors of fish not only directly but also indirectly by  altering the chemical perception of natural substances of eco-ethological  importance. In consideration of the basic role of olfaction in fish behavior,  these results also emphasize the need for further developments on the possible  effects of aquatic toxicants on olfactory-mediated behaviors.",1998-10,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,484-491,,3,35,,Arch Environ Contam Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 9732481,,,,"Animals; Atrazine/*toxicity; Behavior, Animal/*drug effects; Diuron/*toxicity; Epidermis/metabolism; Goldfish/*physiology; Herbicides/*toxicity; Smell/drug effects; Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As an important factor in  regulating populations, DD is also crucial for understanding risks to populations  from stressors, including its incorporation into population models applied for  this purpose. However, study of density-dependent regulation is challenging  because it can occur through various mechanisms, and their identification in the  field, as well as the quantification of the consequences on individuals and  populations, can be difficult. We conducted a targeted literature review  specifically focusing on empirical laboratory or field studies addressing  negative DD in freshwater fish and small rodent populations, two vertebrate  groups considered in pesticide Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA). We found that  the most commonly recognized causes of negative DD were food (63% of 19 reviewed  fish studies, 40% of 25 mammal studies) or space limitations (32% of mammal  studies). In addition, trophic interactions were reported as causes of population  regulation, with predation shaping mostly small mammal populations (36% of the  mammal studies) and cannibalism impacting freshwater fish (26%). In the case of  freshwater fish, 63% of the studies were experimental (i.e., with a length of  weeks or months). They generally focused on the individual-level causes and  effects of DD, and had a short duration. Moreover, DD affected mostly juvenile  growth and survival of fish (68%). On the other hand, studies on small mammals  were mainly based on time series analyzing field population properties over  longer timespans (68%). Density dependence primarily affected survival in  subadult and adult mammal stages and, to a lesser extent, reproduction (60% vs.  36%). Furthermore, delayed DD was often observed (56%). We conclude by making  suggestions on future research paths, providing recommendations for including DD  in population models developed for ERA, and making the best use of the available  data.

Part 1: Dissolved humic substances (HS) in aquaculture and ornamental fish breeding.,Environmental science and pollution research international,,0944-1344,10.1065/espr2007.08.448,,"GOALS, SCOPE AND BACKGROUND: Changing environmental conditions and handling stress are well known to cause chronic or acute stress situations in fish with  subsequent infections. These requires a therapy by means of antibiotics and  chemicals. In contrast to the huge number of pathogens, only a few substances are  permitted for application as therapeutics in German aquaculture. Hence, there  emerges an urgent need for highly effective and residueless alternatives. MAIN  FEATURES: The prophylactic stimulation and training of the defense system of fish  by alternative approaches becomes increasingly necessary. One approach is the  application of dissolved humic substances (HS) of natural or artificial origin.  For example, there exist several reports on the positive effect of HS to fishes.  These effects shall be considered in detail. Furthermore, the impact of HS on the  constitution of parasites and pathogens will be displayed. The reports on this  issue are diverse, if not inconsistent. We try to shed some light on these  discrepancies. The last aspect covered by this review is the outdated paradigm  that calcium ions act as antidotes. In the presence of HS, even the opposite  effect may occur. APPROACH: To overcome old paradigms on HS and their potential  interactions with fish and fish parasites, we reviewed recent international  literature, as well as 'grey' literature. We also include results from own former  and ongoing studies. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: HS are able to increase the  physiological condition of the individuals and to reduce adverse physiological  and histological consequences caused by stress; the mechanism behind remains  obscure. HS detoxify heavy metals and organic pollutants. Damages caused by  several fish pathogens, such as bacteria and parasites, can be repaired more  quickly in the presence of HS. Some parasites--mainly fungi--appear to be  directly affected by HS. Comparing the fungicidal effects of HS from various  sources, evidence is increasing that the aliphatic moiety may be the effective  structures. However, further research is necessary to relate more physiological  and anti-pathogenic effects to the chemical characteristics of HS. CONCLUSIONS:  HS are not real alternatives to strong traditional therapeutics. However, they  show different advantages in repairing secondary, stress induced damages in fish.  The ecophysiological relevance of HS in either aquatic systems or aquaculture is  getting conspicuously. PERSPECTIVES: The lack of therapeutic and antiparasitic  substances in aquaculture requires new strategies and ways of thinking. The  search for alternatives to the 'traditional' chemical therapeutics calls for the  intensive research. Inevitably, this search will lead to an intensive  contemplation on HS as 'health promoting substances' and/or even therapeutics.  Basic research is needed to detect the functional groups of the HS responsible  for the effects observed. Health promoting effects of first investigations made  in vitro to affect pathogens via application of HS and several field studies with  HS raises hopes for a broader utilisation of HS to reduce stress consequences in  fish and fish pathogens residuelessly.",2008-01,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,17-22,,1,15,,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Germany PMID: 18306883,,,,*Humic Substances; Animals; Aquaculture/*methods; Fish Diseases/microbiology/parasitology/*therapy; Fishes/growth & development/*physiology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of their  relative specificity to insect nicotinic receptors, they are thought to have  reduced risk of neurotoxicity in vertebrates. However, there is scant published  literature concerning the neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure of  vertebrates to neonicotinoids. METHODS: Using zebrafish, we investigated the  neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure to imidacloprid, a prototypic  neonicotinoid pesticide. Nicotine was also administered for comparison. Zebrafish  were exposed via immersion in aqueous solutions containing 45 μM or 60 μM of  imidacloprid or nicotine (or vehicle control) from 4h to 5d post fertilization.  The functional effects of developmental exposure to both imidacloprid and  nicotine were assessed in larvae using an activity assay and during adolescence  and adulthood using a battery of neurobehavioral assays, including assessment of  sensorimotor response and habituation in a tactile startle test, novel tank  swimming, and shoaling behavior. RESULTS: In larvae, developmental imidacloprid  exposure at both doses significantly decreased swimming activity. The 5D strains  of zebrafish were more sensitive to both nicotine and imidacloprid than the AB*  strain. In adolescent and adult fish, developmental exposure to imidacloprid  significantly decreased novel tank exploration and increased sensorimotor  response to startle stimuli. While nicotine did not affect novel tank swimming,  it increased sensorimotor response to startle stimuli at the low dose. No effects  of either compound were found on shoaling behavior or habituation to a startling  stimulus. DISCUSSION: Early developmental exposure to imidacloprid has both  early-life and persisting effects on neurobehavioral function in zebrafish.

We studied these behaviors by observing fish twice-daily throughout the  exposure period at 30-s intervals for 5 min, registering the vertical  distribution of fish in the water column and the number of agoniztic acts between  all individuals. Fish exposed to the mixture of herbicides were hypoactive and  spent more time in the lower parts of the aquaria in comparison to non-exposed  controls, reflecting inhibited swimming activity. Average swimming height of  exposed fish decreased significantly with the number of agoniztic acts, whilst in  control groups there was no significant relationship between the two behaviors.

In  recent decades, the aquaculture sector has experienced a steady growth  postulating as a good alternative for seafood production. However, a social  debate exits about the differential level of pollutants in wild and farmed  species. This study was designed to evaluate the level of pollutants in a  sentinel species: Bogue (Boops boops) associated and non-associated to fish-farm  cages. A total of 82 chemical substances were determined by gas  chromatography-mass spectrometry, including persistent (polychlorobiphenyls  (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)), semi-persistent (bromodiphenyl  ethers (BDEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), and emerging  pollutants (such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) and UV-filters). In  general, aquaculture-associated bogues showed lower levels of semi-persistent and  emerging pollutants than wild-caught fish, especially when sums were considered.  Thus, sum of BDEs was significantly lower in the aquaculture group (p=0.01). A  similar trend was also observed for benzo(a)anthracene, the UV-filter  2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate and some OPFRs. In the case of persistent  pollutants, the sum of dioxin-like PCBs and sum of DDTs were lower in the group  of wild-caught bogues (p=0.034 and p=0.003, respectively) than in  aquaculture-associated bogues, as previously described for some aquaculture  species. Fish feed appear as an important factor in the uptake of such substances  suggesting a diet intervention to reduce their levels in the aquaculture  products. Another interesting result is that for almost all chemical substances  analyzed, bogues captured near sewage outfalls showed the highest levels of  pollutants, pointing out the need of stringent measures for wastewater treatment  units discharging in coastal areas. On the light of these results, further  research in specific farmed and wild fish species in relation to their dietary  value and pollutant's levels seems to be mandatory.",01/03/2017,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,199-208,,,581-582,,Sci Total Environ,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed  to THCP (1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10,000 μg/L) for 5 days and then recovered in  THCP-free water for 20 days to investigate the effects of early-stage THCP  exposure on the development, antioxidant defense, and neurotransmitter systems of  zebrafish, and explore their recovery mechanism. The results show that THCP  exposure induced developmental toxicity and oxidative stress in zebrafish. The  hypoactivity, behavioral alterations (decreased avoidance and edge preference  behaviors) and neurotoxicity were found throughout the exposure-recovery  experiments. THCP exposure altered the expression of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-  and serotonin (5-HT)-related genes accompanied by the decrease in GABA and 5-HT  contents. However, after recovery, GABA content returned to the control level,  but 5-HT did not, indicating that only the serotonergic system was persistently  disrupted. Overall, our results suggest that the disruption of the serotonergic  system and oxidative stress may aggravate neurotoxicity and that the former was  the main reason for the depressive-like behavior.

Zebrafish were fed  pellets spiked with 0.03, 0.15, or 1.8μg/g dieldrin for 21days. Behavioral  analysis revealed no difference in exploratory behaviors or those related to  anxiety. Transcriptional networks for T-cell aggregation and selection were  decreased in expression suggesting an immunosuppressive effect of dieldrin,  consistent with other studies investigating organochlorine pesticides. Processes  related to oxidative phosphorylation were also differentially affected by  dieldrin. Quantitative proteomics (iTRAQ) using a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap  identified 226 proteins that were different following one or more doses. These  proteins included ATP synthase subunits (mitochondrial) and hypoxia up-regulated  protein 1 which were decreased and NADH dehydrogenases (mitochondrial) and signal  recognition particle 9 which were up-regulated. Thus, proteins affected were  functionally associated with the mitochondria and a protein network analysis  implicated Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease as diseases  associated with altered proteins. Molecular networks related to mitochondrial  dysfunction and T-cell regulation are hypothesized to underlie the association  between dieldrin and PD. These data contribute to a comprehensive transcriptomic  and proteomic biomarker framework for pesticide exposures and neurodegenerative  diseases. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dieldrin is a persistent organochlorine  pesticide that has been associated with human neurodegenerative disease such as  Parkinson's disease. Dieldrin is ranked 18th on the 2015 U.S. Agency for Toxic  Substances and Disease Registry and continues to be a pesticide of concern for  human health. Transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics (ITRAQ) were employed  to characterize the molecular networks in the central nervous system that are  altered with dietary exposure to dieldrin. We found that transcriptional and  protein networks related to the immune system, mitochondria, and Parkinson's  disease were preferentially affected by dieldrin. The study provides new insight  into the mechanisms of dieldrin neurotoxicity that may explain, in part, the  association between this pesticide and increased risks to neurodegeneration.  These data contribute in a significant way to developing a molecular framework  for pesticide induced neurotoxicity.",22/03/2017,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,71-82,,,157,,J Proteomics,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, at 30 min of exposure to 100  microg/L carbaryl, l-serine-evoked EOGs of sockeye were 49.7% of control versus  60.3 and 62.3% for rainbow and coho, suggesting sockeye were more sensitive to  carbaryl. In all species the l-serine-evoked EOGs did not return to baseline by  15 min after 100 microg/L carbaryl exposure, suggesting persisting impairment of  amino acid detection. The TChA-evoked EOGs were less affected by carbaryl  exposure (i.e. EOGs were 83.3, 84.9 and 66.0% of control 15 min after exposure)  and not affected at all by 100 microg/L linuron exposure. Species-specific  differences in pesticide sensitivity may limit extrapolation of toxicity across  salmonids while the generally greater sensitivity of amino acid olfaction may  lead to selective impairment of behaviors such as predator evasion.",07/03/2007,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,175-187,,02-Mar,231,,Toxicology,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Ireland PMID: 17239514,,,,"Animals; Species Specificity; Herbicides/*toxicity; Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Serine; *Salmon; Carbaryl/*toxicity; Linuron/*toxicity; Olfactory Receptor Neurons/*drug effects/metabolism/physiopathology; Smell/*drug effects/physiology; Taurocholic Acid",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are significant concerns over  its toxicity, especially due to its relative stability in water, soil, and air.  Zebrafish, an important developmental model, has been used for studying the  effects of toxic compounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure to  dichlorvos at early life stages (1 h postfertilization - 7 days  postfertilization) in the zebrafish and its toxicological effects during the  development, through morphological (7 days postfertilization), locomotor and  social behavior analysis (7, 14, 30, 70, and 120 days postfertilization).  Dichlorvos (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) exposure reduced the body length and heartbeat  rate at 7 days postfertilization (dpf), as well as the surface area of the eyes  (5 and 10 mg/L). The avoidance behavior test showed a significant decrease in  escape responses at 7 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 14 (5 and 10 mg/L) dpf zebrafish.  The evaluation of larval exploratory behavior showed a reduction in distance  traveled, mean speed (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and time mobile (10 mg/L) between  control and dichlorvos groups. In addition, the analysis performed on adult  animals showed that the changes in distance traveled and mean speed remained  reduced in 30 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 70 dpf (5 and 10 mg/L), recovering values  similar to the control at 120 dpf. The social behavior of zebrafish was not  altered by exposure to dichlorvos in the early stages of development. Thus, the  exposure to organophosphorus compounds at early stages of development induces an  increased susceptibility to behavioral and neuronal changes that could be  associated with several neurodegenerative diseases.",2019-02,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,1117-1123,,,245,,Environ Pollut,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

It is highly toxic during  all stages of mosquito development, suppresses metamorphosis, and interferes in  insect reproduction and proliferation. Pyriproxyfen and its main metabolite have  been shown to affect brain development in rodents. This compound is employed  mainly to eliminate outbreaks of the genus Aedes, even in potable water. Despite  the increasing number of toxicological studies about larvicides and  insecticides-with an indication of continuous use-there have been few studies  about the effects of pyriproxyfen in non-target species such as fish. This study  evaluated the effects of pyriproxyfen on behavioral, cognitive, and endocrine  parameters in zebrafish. We exposed adult zebrafish to different pyriproxyfen  (Pestanal(®)) concentrations (0.125, 0.675, and 1.75 mg/l) for 96 h. We analyzed  behavioral parameters, memory, cortisol levels, and gene expression of  glucocorticoid receptor (gr) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (crf) after  pyriproxyfen exposure. This exposure did not alter locomotion (distance or mean  speed), anxiety-like behavior (latency to enter to the top zone of the tank or  time in the top zone of the tank), and social or aggressive behavior. However,  there was impaired inhibitory avoidance memory at all tested pyriproxyfen  concentrations. Cortisol levels were reduced in exposed groups when compared to  control or vehicle. However, gr and crf gene expression in pyriproxyfen-treated  animals were unaltered when compared to control or vehicle groups.

This was paralleled by recent reports that multiple other metabolites could  emerge from the degradation of parent DDT by naturally occurring organisms or by  interaction with some heavy metals. Nevertheless, only very few data on the  biological activities of these metabolites are available to date. The objective  of this communication is to evaluate, for the first time, the cytotoxicity,  dioxin-like activity, and estrogenicity of the least-studied DDT metabolites.  METHODS: Four DDT metabolites, p,p'-2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1-chloroethylene  (DDMU), p,p'-2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1-chloroethane (DDMS),  p,p'-2,2-bis(4-ch1oropheny1)acetonitrile (DDCN), and  p,p'-2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)acetic acid (DDA), were selected based on their  presence in environmental samples in Germany such as in sediments from the Mulde  River and Teltow Canal. O,p'-DDT was used as reference in all assays.  Cytotoxicity was measured by neutral red retention with the permanent cell line  RTG-2 of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Dioxin-like activity was determined  using the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deetylase assay. The estrogenic potential was  tested in a dot blot/RNAse protection-assay with primary hepatocytes from male  rainbow trout (O. mykiss) and in a yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay. RESULTS:  All DDT metabolites tested revealed a clear dose-response relationship for  cytotoxicity in RTG-2 cells, but no dioxin-like activities with RTL-W1 cells. The  dot blot/RNAse protection-assay demonstrated that the highest non-toxic  concentrations of these DDT metabolites (50 μM) had vitellogenin-induction  potentials comparable to the positive control (1 nM 17β-estradiol). The  estrogenic activities could be ranked as o,p'-DDT > p,p'-DDMS > p,p'-DDMU >  p,p'-DDCN. In contrast, p,p'-DDA showed a moderate anti-estrogenic effect. In the  YES assay, besides the reference o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDMS and p,p'-DDMU displayed  dose-dependent estrogenic potentials, whereas p,p'-DDCN and p,p'-DDA did not show  any estrogenic potential. DISCUSSION: The reference toxicant o,p'-DDT displayed a  similar spectrum of estrogenic activities similar to 17β-estradiol, however, with  a lower potency. Both p,p'-DDMS and p,p'-DDMU were also shown to have  dose-dependent estrogenic potentials, which were much lower than the reference  o,p'-DDT, in both the vitellogenin and YES bioassays. Interestingly, p,p'-DDA did  not show estrogenic activity but rather displayed a tendency towards  anti-estrogenic activity by inhibiting the estrogenic effect of 17β-estradiol.  The results also showed that the p,p'-metabolites DDMU, DDMS, DDCN, and DDA do  not show any dioxin-like activities in RTL-W1 cells, thus resembling the major  DDT metabolites DDD and DDE. CONCLUSIONS: All the DDT metabolites tested did not  exhibit dioxin-like activities in RTL-W1 cells, but show cytotoxic and estrogenic  activities. Based on the results of the in vitro assays used in our study and on  the reported concentrations of DDT metabolites in contaminated sediments, such  substances could, in the future, pose interference with the normal reproductive  and endocrine functions in various organisms exposed to these chemicals.  Consequently, there is an urgent need to examine more comprehensively the risk of  environmental concentrations of the investigated DDT metabolites using in vivo  studies. However, this should be paralleled also by periodic evaluation and  monitoring of the current levels of the DDT metabolites in environmental  matrices. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: Our results clearly point out the  need to integrate the potential ecotoxicological risks associated with the  ""neglected"" p,p'-DDT metabolites. For instance, these DDT metabolites should be  integrated into sediment risk assessment initiatives in contaminated areas. One  major challenge would be the identification of baseline data for such risk  assessment. Further studies are also warranted to determine possible additive,  synergistic, or antagonistic effects that may interfere with the fundamental  cytotoxicity and endocrine activities of these metabolites. For a more conclusive  assessment of the spectrum of DDT metabolites, additional bioassays are needed to  identify potential anti-estrogenic, androgenic, and/or anti-androgenic effects.",2012-02,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,403-415,,2,19,,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Germany PMID: 21792584,,,,"Male; Animals; Environmental Monitoring/*methods; Geologic Sediments/chemistry; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical/chemistry/*toxicity; Acetonitriles/chemistry/toxicity; Amides/chemistry/toxicity; Berlin; DDT/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/toxicity; Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/toxicity; Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane/chemistry/toxicity; Endocrine Disruptors/chemistry/*toxicity; Estrogens/metabolism; Metals, Heavy/analysis; Oncorhynchus mykiss/growth & development/*physiology; Sulfones/chemistry/toxicity; Toxicity Tests, Acute/methods; Vitellogenins/analysis/metabolism",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work was conducted to map the One Health landscape in  Africa. METHODS: An assessment of existing One Health initiatives in Sub-Saharan  African (SSA) countries was conducted among selected stakeholders using a  multi-method approach. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to One  Health initiatives were identified, and their influence, interest and impacts  were semi-quantitatively evaluated using literature reviews, questionnaire survey  and statistical analysis. RESULTS: One Health Networks and identified initiatives  were spatiotemporally spread across SSA and identified stakeholders were  classified into four quadrants. It was observed that imbalance in stakeholders'  representations led to hesitation in buying-in into One Health approach by  stakeholders who are outside the main networks like stakeholders from the policy,  budgeting, geography and sometimes, the environment sectors. CONCLUSION:  Inclusion of theory of change, monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and tools  for standardized evaluation of One Health policies are needed for a sustained  future of One Health and future engagements should be outputs- and  outcomes-driven and not activity-driven. National roadmaps for One Health  implementation and institutionalization are necessary, and proofs of concepts in  One Health should be validated and scaled-up. Dependence on external funding is  unsustainable and must be addressed in the medium to long-term. Necessary policy  and legal instruments to support One Health nationally and sub-nationally should  be implemented taking cognizance of contemporary issues like urbanization,  endemic poverty and other emerging issues. The utilization of current  technologies and One Health approach in addressing the ongoing pandemic of  COVID-19 and other emerging diseases are desirable.

This study was aimed to investigate the impact of commonly used  pesticides (deltamethrin) on the blood and tissue oxidative stress level in  catfish (Clarias gariepinus); in addition to the protective effect of  α-tocopherol on deltamethrin induced oxidative stress. Catfish were divided into  three groups, 1st control group include 20 fish divided into two tanks each one  contain 10 fish, 2nd deltamethrin group, where Fish exposed to deltamethrin in a  concentration (0.75 μg/l) and 3rd Vitamin E group, Fish exposed to deltamethrin  and vitamin E at a dose of 12 μg/l for successive 4 days.Serum, liver, kidney and  Gills were collected for biochemical assays. Tissue oxidative stress biomarkers  malondialdhyde (MDA) and catalase activity in liver, kidney and gills tissues,  serum liver enzymes (ALT and AST), serum albumin, total protein, urea and  creatinine were analysed. RESULTS: Our results showed that 48 h. exposure to 0.75  μg/l deltamethrin significantly (p < 0.05) increased lipid peroxidation (MDA) in  the liver, kidney and gills while catalase activity was significantly decreased  in the same tissues. This accompanied by significant increase in serum ALT, AST  activity, urea and creatinine and a marked decrease in serum albumin and total  proteins. CONCLUSIONS: It could be concluded that deltamethrin is highly toxic to  catfish even in very low concentration (0.75 μg/l). Moreover the effect of  deltamethrin was pronounced in the liver of catfish in comparison with kidneys  and gills. Moreover fish antioxidants and oxidative stress could be used as  biomarkers for aquatic pollution, thus helping in the diagnosis of pollution.

In the  liver, a reduction in ROS and ACAP was observed after 24 h, whereas an increase  in ACAP was observed after 48 h in the highest concentration. Exposure to the  lowest concentration caused a reduction in ROS after 72 and 96 h.

The objectives of this  short communication were to (1) present and make available this RNA-sequencing  database (i.e., 724 samples from 49 experiments) under the FAIR principles (FAIR  data are data which meet principles of findability, accessibility,  interoperability, and reusability), while also summarizing key meta-data  attributes and (2) use ExpressAnalyst (including the Seq2Fun algorithm and  EcoOmicsDB) to perform a comparative transcriptomics analysis of this database  focusing on baseline and differential transcriptomic changes across species-life  stage-chemical combinations. The database is available in NCBI GEO under  accession number GSE239776. Across all species, the number of raw reads per  sample ranged between 13 and 58 million, with 30% to 79% of clean reads mapped to  the ""vertebrate"" subgroup database in EcoOmicsDB. Principal component analyses of  the reads illustrated separation across the three taxonomic groups as well as  some between tissue types. The most common differentially expressed gene was  CYP1A1 followed by CTSE, FAM20CL, MYC, ST1S3, RIPK4, VTG1, and VIT2. The most  common enriched pathways were metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of cofactors and  biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and chemical carcinogenesis, drug  metabolism, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450.

In addition,  several substances have been reported in the environment that can cause damage to  aquatic species, such as potassium perchlorate (KClO(4)), if exposed to high  concentrations or for long periods.

Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,,1532-0456,10.1016/j.cbpc.2021.108995,,"In teleost fish, radial glial cells (RGCs) are progenitor cells for neurons and the major cell type synthesizing neuroestrogens. We hypothesized that chemical  exposure impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics of RGCs, which then may lead to  downstream consequences for neuroestrogen production. Here we provide proof of  concept that mitochondria of RGCs can be perturbed by fungicides. We isolated  RGCs from a mixed sex population of goldfish (Carassius auratus) and measured  metabolic capacity of primary cells to a model mitotoxin fluazinam, a  broad-spectrum fungicide that inhibits mitochondria electron transport chain (or  ETC) Complex I. Using immunocytochemistry and real-time PCR, we demonstrate that  the goldfish primary cell cultures are highly enriched for glia after multiple  passages. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that glia treated with >25 μM fluazinam  for 24 and 48-h showed reduced viability. As such, metabolic assays were  conducted with non-cytotoxic concentrations (0.25-12.5 μM). Fluazinam did not  affect oxygen consumption rates of RGCs at 24 h, but after 48 h, oligomycin  induced ATP-linked respiration was decreased by both 6.25 and 12.5 μM fluazinam.  Moreover, concentrations as low as 0.25 μM disrupted the mitochondrial membrane  potential of RGCs, reflecting strong uncoupling effects of the fungicide on  mitochondria. Here we provide proof of concept that mitochondrial bioenergetics  of teleostean RGCs can be responsive to agrochemicals. Additional studies are  required to address low-dose exposures in vivo and to determine if metabolic  disruption impairs neuroendocrine functions of RGCs. We propose this mechanism  constitutes a novel aspect of neuroendocrine disruption, significant because  dysregulation of neuron-glia communication is expected to contribute to  neuroendocrine disruption.",2021-05,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,108995,,,243,,Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Eighteen dogs were randomly  assigned to the following treatment groups (n = 6): (1) 65% permethrin, (2) 9.7%  fipronil, or (3) untreated control. Dogs were exposed to ticks in individually  assigned cages with a carpet that covered =70% of the cage bottom. Dogs in  treatment groups 1 and 2 were treated in accordance with label directions for  each re-spective product on study day 0. Fifty unfed, male and female adult ticks  were placed in the cages 15 to 30 minutes before the dogs. The dogs were placed  in the cages for a 2-hour exposure period at 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 41 days  after treatment. After a 2-hour exposure period, dogs were removed from the cages  and live (attached and unattached) and dead ticks were counted on the dogs, on  the carpets, and in the cages.

Here  we aimed to investigate the capacity of diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)(2) diet  supplementation to improve the antioxidant defense of Cyprinus carpio (carp)  exposed to environmental concentrations of ATZ.

ATZ was able to cause  oxidative damage from reactive species production in all tissues of carp, as  observed by the increase of lipid peroxidation and protein damage. The activity  of some antioxidant enzymes was inhibited in carp exposed to ATZ. However,  (PhSe)(2) supplementation was able to prevent this ATZ-induced damage by  improving the activities of antioxidant enzymes and through antioxidant  competence of (PhSe)(2)per se.

In this  work, a mutant of the fish pathogen Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida), called  0909I, was shown to overexpress haemolysin, which could induce a robust  pyroptotic-like cell death dependent on caspase-5-like activity during infection  in fish nonphagocyte cells.

Due to its extensive use, it has been widely detected in aquatic  ecosystems representing a potential threat to non-target organisms, including  fish. Despite the negative impact of this commercial formulation in fish, as  described in literature, the scarcity of studies assessing its genotoxicity and  underlying mechanisms is evident. Therefore, as a novel approach, this study  evaluated the genotoxic potential of Roundup to blood cells of the European eel  (Anguilla anguilla) following short-term (1 and 3 days) exposure to  environmentally realistic concentrations (58 and 116 microg/l), addressing also  the possible association with oxidative stress. Thus, comet and erythrocytic  nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) assays were adopted, as genotoxic end points,  reflecting different types of genetic damage. The pro-oxidant state was assessed  through enzymatic (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase  and glutathione reductase) and non-enzymatic (total glutathione content)  antioxidants, as well as by lipid peroxidation (LPO) measurements. The Roundup  potential to induce DNA strand breaks for both concentrations was demonstrated by  the comet assay. The induction of chromosome breakage and/or segregational  abnormalities was also demonstrated through the ENA assay, though only after  3-day exposure to both tested concentrations. In addition, the two genotoxic  indicators were positively correlated. Antioxidant defences were unresponsive to  Roundup. LPO levels increased only for the high concentration after the first day  of exposure, indicating that oxidative stress caused by this agrochemical in  blood was not severe. Overall results suggested that both DNA damaging effects  induced by Roundup are not directly related with an increased pro-oxidant state.  Moreover, it was demonstrated that environmentally relevant concentrations of  Roundup can pose a health risk for fish populations.",2010-09,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,523-530,,5,25,,Mutagenesis,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 20643706,,,,Animals; DNA Damage; Time Factors; Environmental Exposure/*analysis; Antioxidants/metabolism; Glyphosate; Herbicides/*toxicity; Glycine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity; Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects; Erythrocytes/drug effects/pathology; Anguilla/blood/*metabolism; Cell Nucleus/drug effects/pathology; Comet Assay; Mutagens/*toxicity; Reactive Oxygen Species/*toxicity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Usually,  one miRNA may regulate many genes as its targets, while one gene may also be  targeted by many miRNAs. We previously demonstrated that cyb561d2, whose protein  product is involved in cell defense, and chemical stress, is targeted by miR-155  in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) when exposed to fipronil  (5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl)  sulphinyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile). Microcosm Targets prediction showed that  the cyb561d2 gene is also highly possibly targeted by miR-194a, miR-216b,  miR-429, and miR-499. These interactions need to be further validated  experimentally. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fipronil on miR-194a,  miR-216b, miR-429, miR-499 and cyb561d2 in zebrafish and investigated whether  these four miRNAs could regulate the expression of cyb561d2 in both mRNA and  protein levels. The expression of cyb561d2 was upregulated in both mRNA and  protein level in a dose-dependent manner upon stimulation of fipronil, and  miR-216b and miR-499 were downregulated concurrently, whereas there was no  significant changes were observed in the expression level of miR-194a and  miR-429. The dual luciferase report assay demonstrated that miR-216b and miR-499  interacted with cyb561d2 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR), miR-194a and miR-429  did not stimulate degradation of cyb561d2 mRNA. The expression of cyb561d2 was  reduced in both mRNA and protein level when ZF4 cells were transfected with  miR-499 mimic, whereas expression level of both mRNA and protein was increased  when endogenous miR-499 was inhibited by transfection with miR-499 inhibitor.  Likewise, the mRNA and protein level of cyb561d2 was affected by treatment with  the mimics and the inhibitor of miR-216b. In contrast, when ZF4 cells were  transfected with a mimic of miR-194a or miR-429, the expression of cyb561d2 mRNA  was not significantly changed. As a result, cyb561d2 is targeted by miR-155,  miR-216b and miR-499 upon fipronil exposure, and miR-194a and miR-429 can not  target cyb561d2. The expression pattern of these 3 miRNAs presents novel fipronil  responses that could be used as a toxicological biomarker.",2016-07,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,98-107,,,45,,Environ Toxicol Pharmacol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Since steroid hormone biosynthesis is regulated  through neurotransmission of the central nervous system (CNS), studies were  conducted to determine whether neurotransmitters that control hormone  biosynthesis could be affected after diuron and diuron metabolites treatment. As  the same neurotransmitters and steroid hormones regulate behavioral outcomes,  aggression was also evaluated in male Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Male  tilapias were exposed for 10 days to waterborne diuron and the metabolites  3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA), 3,4-dichlorophenyl-N-methylurea (DCPMU), at nominal  concentrations of 100 ng L(-1). In contrast to Diuron, DCA and DCPMU  significantly diminished plasma testosterone concentrations (39.4% and 36.8%,  respectively) and reduced dopamine levels in the brain (47.1% and 44.2%,  respectively). In addition, concentrations of the stress steroid, cortisol were  increased after DCA (71.0%) and DCPMU (57.8-%) exposure. A significant decrease  in aggressive behavior was also observed in animals treated with the metabolites  DCA (50.9%) and DCPMU (68.8%).

Atrazine  is known to be an endocrine disruptor and its effects on gonads have been  extensively reported, but the toxic action on other organs is poorly documented.  In this paper, we investigated the toxicity of atrazine on the gills and spleens  of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The median lethal concentration  (LC(50)), capable of killing one-half of the test animals was calculated, and  sublethal concentrations of atrazine were used in a semistatic and subchronic  assay. The following four experimental groups were formed: control not exposed to  atrazine, a group exposed to 1 ppm atrazine for 15 days, a group exposed to 2 ppm  for 7 days, and a group exposed to 2 ppm for 15 days. The concentrations were  verified during the study by high performance liquid chromatography. The gills  and spleens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and histopathological  findings were made. The Perls technique was used on the spleens to identify  hemosiderin, lipofuscin, and melanin pigments in the cells from melanomacrophage  centres (MMCs). The spleens were submitted to proliferating cell nuclear antigen  (PCNA) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immunohistochemistry, and  morphometry was used to assess splenocyte proliferation and melanomacrophage iNOS  expression. Finally, a colorimetric assay for caspase-3 was performed on the  spleens to identify apoptosis. Vascular and structural alterations, such as  venous sinus congestion, aneurysm, hemorrhage, pillar cell hypertrophy,  disarrangement of secondary lamellae, and epithelial lifting were observed in the  gills. The frequency of individuals with aneurysms was higher in the groups  treated with 2 ppm than in other groups. Atrazine had an immunomodulatory effect  on the spleen, observed by the alteration in the percentage of red and white  pulp, alteration of the MMC area, changes in the melanomacrophage pigment  content, slight iNOS suppression, decrease in splenocyte proliferation under  1 ppm atrazine, and increased caspase 3 activity under 2 ppm atrazine after 7 and  15 d.

This  study established in Nile tilapia models suggests that T cells play a critical  role in resisting Edwardsiella piscicida infection via cytotoxicity and are  essential for IgM(+) B cell response. CD3 and CD28 monoclonal antibody  crosslinking reveals that full activation of tilapia T cells requires the first  and secondary signals, while Ca(2+) -NFAT, MAPK/ERK, NF-κB, and mTORC1 pathways  and IgM(+) B cells collectively regulate T cell activation. Thus, despite the  large evolutionary distance, tilapia and mammals such as mice and humans exhibit  similar T cell functions. Furthermore, it is speculated that transcriptional  networks and metabolic reprogramming, especially c-Myc-mediated glutamine  metabolism triggered by mTORC1 and MAPK/ERK pathways, underlie the functional  similarity of T cells between tilapia and mammals. Notably, tilapia, frogs,  chickens, and mice utilize the same mechanisms to facilitate  glutaminolysis-regulated T cell responses, and restoration of the glutaminolysis  pathway using tilapia components rescues the immunodeficiency of human Jurkat T  cells.

Behavioral assays in adult zebrafish provide a standardized and  reliable means to study a wide range of behaviors, including anxiety, social  interaction, learning, memory, and addiction. Behavioral assays in adult  zebrafish typically involve placing the fish in an experimental arena and  recording and analyzing their behavior using video tracking software. Fish can be  exposed to various stimuli, and their behavior can be quantified using a variety  of metrics. The novel tank test is one of the most accepted and widely used tests  to study anxiety-like behavior in fish. The shoaling and social preference tests  are useful in studying the social behavior of zebrafish. This assay is  particularly interesting since the behavior of the entire shoal is studied. These  assays have proven to be highly reproducible and sensitive to pharmacological and  genetic manipulations, making them valuable tools for studying the neural  circuits and molecular mechanisms underlying behavior. Additionally, these assays  can be used in drug screening to identify compounds that may be potential  modulators of behavior. We will show in this work how to apply behavioral tools  in fish neurotoxicology, analyzing the effect of methamphetamine, a recreational  drug, and glyphosate, an environmental pollutant. The results demonstrate the  significant contribution of behavioral assays in adult zebrafish to the  understanding of the neurotoxicological effects of environmental pollutants and  drugs, in addition to providing insights into the molecular mechanisms that may  alter neuronal function.",03/11/2023,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,United States,eng,,,,,,,DOI: 10.3791/65869 ISSN: 1940-087X Issue: 201 Journal Abbreviation: J Vis Exp Publication Title: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE PMID: 37982528,,,,"Animals; Social Behavior; Anxiety/chemically induced; *Zebrafish/physiology; *Behavior, Animal/physiology; Behavior Rating Scale",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have rescued and characterized  two members of the MIF family, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (OfMIF) and  D-Dopachrome tautomerase (OfDDT) from rock bream, Oplegnathus fasciatus. The  deduced OfMIF and OfDDT protein sequences revealed the presence of the catalytic  oxidoreductase (CXXC), motif. They also possessed highly conserved proline (P(2))  and lysine residues (K(33)), responsible for their isomerase and tautomerase  functions. Rock bream MIF and DDT homologues shared higher identity with fish  homologues and also with mammals and occupied a distinct position in the  phylogenetic tree, depicting their evolutionary conservation. The spatial  expression analysis revealed the highest expression of both OfMIF and OfDDT in  liver, while portraying constitutive expression in other tissues. The recombinant  proteins purified using the Escherichia coli system revealed potent  oxidoreductase activity against insulin with both dithiothreitol and glutathione  as reducing agents. Stimulation of rock bream head kidney cells with recombinant  OfMIF and OfDDT proteins induced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines like  tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interleukin-1β  (IL-1β).

Fish were  exposed to a concentration of 2 ppm atrazine for 15 days, which was verified by  high-performance liquid chromatography. The livers were stained with hematoxylin  and eosin and histopathological data were collected. In addition, they were  submitted to immunohistochemistry for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). A  maximum variation of 45% (static) and 12.5% (semi-static) was observed between  the observed and nominal atrazine concentration. Nuclear and cytoplasmic changes  were observed in both experimental models. Hepatocytes from the livers of the  static system showed a degenerative appearance, while in the semi-static system,  intense cytoplasmic vacuolization and necrosis were observed. iNOS positive cells  were identified only in macrophages in the hepatocytes of fish in the semi-static  system.

Obtaining  more information is important since the aquatic environment is widely exposed to  pollution involving neurotoxic compounds likely to cause phenotypic changes that  can affect animal fitness. We explored how early exposure to the pyrethroid  insecticide permethrin (PM), a compound known for its neurotoxicity, influences  the phenotypic traits in both larvae and adults of the self-fertilizing fish  mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus. First, we investigated immediate  effects of PM on larvae after one-week exposure (0-7 days post-hatching): larvae  exposed to high concentration (200 µg.L(-1)) grew less, were less active, had  negative thigmotaxis and were less likely to capture prey than control  individuals and those exposed to low concentration (5 µg.L(-1)). No difference  was found between treatments when considering oxygen consumption rate and  cortisol levels. Persistent effects of early exposure to PM on adults (147-149  days post-hatching) showed that fish previously exposed to high concentration of  PM overcompensated growth, leading them to finally be longer and heavier than  fish from other treatments. Moreover, we evidenced that levels of cortisol  interacted with early PM exposure to affect behaviours during dyadic contests.  Fish were more likely to initiate fighting behaviours and were more likely to be  aggressive when they have low pre-contest levels of cortisol, but these effects  were less pronounced when individuals were exposed to PM. This study shows that  PM can have both immediate and persistent effects on phenotypic traits in a  self-fertilizing vertebrate and suggests that a pyrethroid can interact with  hormones action to affect animal behaviour.",2023-06,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,106543,,,259,,Aquat Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Identification of the first prokaryotic member of the so-called MMBLs (monocot  mannose-binding lectins) or GNA (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin) lectin family and  discovery of its genus-specific killer activity in the Gram-negative bacteria  Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas has added yet another kind of toxin to this group of  allelopathic molecules. This novel feature is reminiscent of the protective  function, on the basis of antifungal, insecticidal, nematicidal or antiviral  activity, assigned to or proposed for several of the eukaryotic MMBL proteins  that are ubiquitously distributed among monocot plants, but also occur in some  other plants, fish, sponges, amoebae and fungi. Direct bactericidal activity can  also be effected by a C-type lectin, but this is a mammalian protein that limits  mucosal colonization by Gram-positive bacteria. The presence of two divergent  MMBL domains in the novel bacteriocins raises questions about task distribution  between modules and the possible role of carbohydrate binding in the specificity  of target strain recognition and killing. Notably, bacteriocin activity was also  demonstrated for a hybrid MMBL protein with an accessory protease-like domain.  This association with one or more additional modules, often with predicted  peptide-hydrolysing or -binding activity, suggests that additional bacteriotoxic  proteins may be found among the diverse chimaeric MMBL proteins encoded in  prokaryotic genomes.

Accordingly, a great deal of previous  research has characterized physiological mechanisms of toxicity in animals  exposed to contaminants. In contrast, effects of contaminants on fish behaviour  are less frequently studied. Because behaviour links physiological function with  ecological processes, behavioural indicators of toxicity appear ideal for  assessing the effects of aquatic pollutants on fish populations. Here we consider  the many toxicants that disrupt complex fish behaviours, such as predator  avoidance, reproductive, and social behaviours. Toxicant exposure often  completely eliminates the performance of behaviours that are essential to fitness  and survival in natural ecosystems, frequently after exposures of lesser  magnitude than those causing significant mortality. Unfortunately, the  behavioural toxicity of many xenobiotics is still unknown, warranting their  future study. Physiological effects of toxicants in the literature include  disruption of sensory, hormonal, neurological, and metabolic systems, which are  likely to have profound implications for many fish behaviours. However, little  toxicological research has sought to integrate the behavioural effects of  toxicants with physiological processes. Those studies that take this  multidisciplinary approach add important insight into possible mechanisms of  behavioural alteration. The most commonly observed links with behavioural  disruption include cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition, altered brain  neurotransmitter levels, sensory deprivation, and impaired gonadal or thyroid  hormone levels. Even less frequently studied are the implications of interrelated  changes in behaviour and physiology caused by aquatic pollutants for fish  populations. We conclude that future integrative, multidisciplinary research is  clearly needed to increase the significance and usefulness of behavioural  indicators for aquatic toxicology, and aim to highlight specific areas for  consideration.",14/07/2004,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,369-392,,4,68,,Aquat Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright 2004 Elsevier B.V.,,,,,,Place: Netherlands PMID: 15177953,,,,"Animals; Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity; Fishes/*physiology; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Behavior, Animal/*drug effects/*physiology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to  obtain an oral DNA nanovaccine and to evaluate its efficacy against Phdp in S.  senegalensis juveniles. For this purpose, the amplified product corresponding to  the protein inosine-5'-monophophate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) from Phdp, was cloned  into the expression vector pcDNA™6.2/C-EmGFP-GW obtaining the DNA vaccine named  as pPDPimpdh. The correct transcription and protein expression was verified at  48 h post tansfection in HEK293 cells. Chitosan nanoparticles (CS-TPP NPs) were  prepared by ionotropic gelation and their features were appropriate for use as  oral delivery system. Therefore, pPDPimpdh was protected with chitosan CS-TPP NPs  throughout complex coacervation method giving as a result a DNA nanovaccine  referred as CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs. Sole juveniles were vaccinated orally with  CS-TPP NPs, pPDPimpdh and CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs followed by a challenge with Phdp  at 30 days post vaccination (dpv). The relative percentage survival (RPS) for  pPDPimpdh vaccinated groups was 6.25%, probably due to its degradation in the  digestive tract. RPS value obtained for CS-TPP NPs and CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs was  40% and antibodies were observed in both cases. However, a delay in mortality was  observed in sole juveniles vaccinated orally with CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs. In fact,  an upregulation of tf, mhcII, cd8a and igm in the posterior gut and c3, hamp1, tf  and cd4 in spleen was observed in juveniles vaccinated with CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs.  After challenge, a modulation of cd8a and cd4 expression levels in the posterior  gut and c3, tf, lyg, cd4, igm and igt expression levels in spleen was observed.  Moreover, the concentration of lysozyme in skin mucus significantly increased in  fish vaccinated orally with CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs at 11 dpc.

To better elucidate the mode of action of dieldrin in the  hypothalamus, this study measured neurotransmitter levels and examined the  transcriptomic response in female largemouth bass (LMB) to an acute treatment of  dieldrin. Male and female LMB were injected with either vehicle or 10 mg  dieldrin/kg and sacrificed after 7 days. There were no significant changes in  dopamine or DOPAC concentrations in the neuroendocrine brain of males and females  after treatment but GABA levels in females were moderately increased 20-30% in  the hypothalamus and cerebellum. In the female hypothalamus, there were 227  transcripts (p<0.001) identified as being differentially regulated by dieldrin.  Functional enrichment analysis revealed transcription, DNA repair,  ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and cell communication, as biological processes  over-represented in the microarray analysis. Pathway analysis identified DNA  damage, inflammation, regeneration, and Alzheimer's disease as major cell  processes and diseases affected by dieldrin. Using multiple bioinformatics  approaches, this study demonstrates that the teleostean hypothalamus is a target  for dieldrin-induced neurotoxicity and provides mechanistic evidence that  dieldrin activates similar cell pathways and biological processes that are also  associated with the etiology of human neurological disorders.",2010-08,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,356-366,,4,31,,Neurotoxicology,,,,,,,,eng,(c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Since  the target molecule of diazinon is typically the acetylcholinesterase enzyme  (AChE), the existence of a non-neuronal cholinergic system in leukocytes makes  them susceptible to alterations by diazinon. Therefore, the aim of this work was  to evaluate the activity of AChE, acetylcholine (ACh) concentration, and the  expression of nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChR) and muscarinic ACh receptors  (mAChR) in spleen mononuclear cells (SMNC) of Nile tilapia (O. niloticus) exposed  in vitro to diazoxon, a diazinon metabolite. SMNC were exposed in-vitro to 1 nM,  1 μM, and 10 μM diazoxon for 24 h. The enzyme activity of AChE was then evaluated  by spectrophotometry, followed by ACh quantification by ultra-performance liquid  chromatography. Finally, mAChR and nAChR expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR. The  results indicate that AChE levels are significantly inhibited at 1 and 10 μM  diazoxon, while the relative expression of (M3, M4, and M5) mAChR and (β2) nAChR  is reduced significantly as compared against SMNC not exposed to diazoxon.  However, ACh levels show no significant difference with respect to the control  group. The data indicate that diazoxon directly alters elements in the  cholinergic system of SMNC by AChE inhibition or indirectly through the  interaction with AChR, which is likely related to the immunotoxic properties of  diazinon and its metabolites.",2021-01,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,134-141,,,108,,Fish Shellfish Immunol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is a paucity of information regarding its acute/chronic effects on  obesity, lipid homeostasis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, especially regarding  the underlying molecular mechanisms in humans. Herein, we investigated the  effects of TCPP exposure (5-25 mg/L) on lipid homeostasis in larval and adult  zebrafish (Danio rerio). TCPP exposure caused remarkable lipid-metabolism  dysfunction, which was reflected in obesity and excessive lipid accumulation in  zebrafish liver. Mechanistically, TCPP induced the over-expression of  adipogenesis genes and suppressed the expression of fatty-acid β-oxidation genes.  Consequently, excess lipid synthesis and deficient expenditure triggered  oxidative damage and an inflammation response by disrupting the antioxidant  system and over-expressing proinflammatory cytokine. Based on high-throughput  transcriptome sequencing, we found that TCPP exposure led to enrichment of  several pathways involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation, as well as  several genes related to pathways of cancer. Notably, increasing expressions of  Ki-67 and 53BP1 proteins, which are reliable biomarkers for recognition and risk  prediction of cellular proliferation in cancer cells, were observed in liver  tissues of adult zebrafish. These results imply that chronic TCPP exposure  triggers a potential risk of hepatocellular carcinogenesis (HCC) progression.

Therefore, the purpose  of this trial is to estimate the impact of guppy fish (guppies), in combination  with the use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen (Sumilarv® 2MR), and Communication for  Behavioral Impact (COMBI) activities to reduce entomological indices in Cambodia.  METHODS/DESIGN: In this cluster randomized controlled, superiority trial, 30  clusters comprising one or more villages each (with approximately 170 households)  will be allocated, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive either (1) three interventions  (guppies, Sumilarv® 2MR, and COMBI activities), (2) two interventions (guppies  and COMBI activities), or (3) control (standard vector control). Households will  be invited to participate, and entomology surveys among 40 randomly selected  households per cluster will be carried out quarterly. The primary outcome will be  the population density of adult female Aedes mosquitoes (i.e., number per house)  trapped using adult resting collections. Secondary outcome measures will include  the House Index, Container Index, Breteau Index, Pupae Per House, Pupae Per  Person, mosquito infection rate, guppy fish coverage, Sumilarv® 2MR coverage, and  percentage of respondents with knowledge about Aedes mosquitoes causing dengue.  In the primary analysis, adult female Aedes density and mosquito infection rates  will be aggregated over follow-up time points to give a single rate per cluster.  This will be analyzed by negative binomial regression, yielding density ratios.  DISCUSSION: This trial is expected to provide robust estimates of the  intervention effect. A rigorous evaluation of these vector-control interventions  is vital to developing an evidence-based dengue control strategy and to help  direct government resources.

The acute toxicity of  Roundup (particularly of glyphosate) to animals is considered to be low according  to the World Health Organization, but the extensive use of Roundup may still  cause environmental problems with negative impact on wildlife, particularly in an  aquatic environment where chemicals may persist for a long time. Therefore, we  studied the effects of Roundup on markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant  defense in goldfish, Carassius auratus. The fish were given 96 h exposure to  Roundup at concentrations of 2.5-20 mg L(-1). Exposure to Roundup did not affect  levels of lipid peroxides (LOOH) in goldfish brain or liver, and in kidney only  the 10 mg L(-1) treatment elevated LOOH by 3.2-fold. Herbicide exposure also had  no effect on the concentrations of protein thiols or low molecular mass thiols in  kidney, but selective suppression of low molecular mass thiols by 26-29% occurred  at some treatment levels in brain and liver. Roundup exposure generally  suppressed the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione  S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  in fish tissues. For example, SOD activities were reduced by 51-68% in brain,  58-67% in liver and 33-53% in kidney of Roundup treated fish. GST activity  decreased by 29-34% in liver. However, catalase activity increased in both liver  and kidney of herbicide-exposed fish.

Aerobic digestion (AED) or composting and anaerobic digestion (AD) are two organic waste  management practices that produce a value-added final product. Few side-by-side  comparisons of both technologies and their digestate products have been  performed. The objective of this study was to compare the impact of initial  feedstock properties (moisture content and/or C/N ratio) on stabilization rate by  AED and AD and soil amendment characteristics of the final products. Green and  food wastes were considered as they are two of the main contributors to municipal  organic waste. Stabilization rate was assessed by measurement of CH(4) and CO(2)  evolution for AD and AED, respectively. For AD, CH(4) yield showed a second-order  relationship with the C/N content (P < 0.05); the optimal C/N ratio indicated by  the relationship was 25.5. For AED, cumulative CO(2) evolution values were  significantly affected by the C/N ratio and moisture content of the initial  feedstock (P < 0.05). A response surface model showed optimal AED stabilization  for a C/N of 25.6 and moisture of 64.9% (wet basis). AD final products presented  lower soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) but lower humification degree and  aromaticity than the products from AED. This lower stability may lead to further  degradation when amended to soil. The results suggest that composting feedstocks  with higher C/N produces an end-product with higher suitability for soil  amendment. The instability of end products from AD could be leveraged in pest  control techniques that rely on organic matter degradation to produce compounds  with pesticidal properties.",2018-07,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,555-564,,,77,,Waste Manag,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The  experiments were divided in acute (one dose, 5-day) and sub-chronic (3 doses,  15-day). Control groups received an equal volume of PBS or canola oil (1 ml  kg(-1)). The three tested contaminants altered AChE activity in brain and muscle  in similar ways; the mixtures antagonized the increase evoked by the contaminants  alone. BaP and TBT increased GSH content and mixtures reduced it. GPx activity  was increased by DDT and TBT in the 15-day experiment and reduced by the  mixtures. BaP increased GST activity in sub-chronic experiment while TBT reduced  it in the acute experiment. BaP/TBT increased GST activity compared to all  groups; the other mixtures reduced it compared to BaP or DDT in the 5-day  experiment. BaP, DDT and TBT increased δ-ALAd activity mainly in acute exposure;  the mixtures also increased δ-ALAd compared to DDT or TBT in 5 and 15-day. BaP,  TBT and BaP/DDT decreased LPO in the acute experiment. In the sub-chronic  experiment DDT/TBT increased LPO when compared to TBT.

In this  study, goldfish (Carassius auratus) were subjected to individual and combined  pesticide mixtures and increased temperatures to evaluate their adaptive response  in multistress conditions from the molecular to the individual level. Fish were  exposed for 16 days to a mixture of pesticides at environmental relevant  concentrations (S-metolachlor, isoproturon, linuron, atrazine-desethyl,  aclonifen, pendimethalin and tebuconazole) and at two temperatures (22 °C and  32 °C).

Results show that (1) environmentally relevant  concentrations of pesticides lead to significant responses in fish at all  biological levels; (2) the metabolic response depends on the nature of stress  (thermal vs. chemical); and (3) fish may be unable to set up an efficient  adaptive response when chemical and thermal stresses were combined, with adverse  outcomes at the individuals' level.",2017-12,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,60-72,,,188,,Chemosphere,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The in  vitro germination and growth of the propagules of the EUS pathogen, Aphanomyces  invadans (= A. piscicida), were assessed in the presence of the head-kidney  macrophages, serum, and serum heated to inactivate complement proteins, of three  EUS-susceptible and one resistant fish species. The susceptible species were:  striped snakehead (Channa striata), giant gourami (Osphronemus gouramy) and  silver barb [Barbodes (= Puntius) gonionotus], and the resistant species was Nile  tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fish of all species were acclimatised to either  low temperature (20 degrees C +/- 1.6) at which EUS is known to occur, or to high  temperature (32 degrees C +/- 5.0) at which EUS does not occur, except for giant  gouramis which were only studied at low temperature. The respiratory burst of the  macrophages was assessed in the presence of A. invadans or the stimulant phorbol  myristate acetate (PMA), and compared to that of controls. Anti-A. invadans  antibody concentrations were assessed in all species except silver barbs. All  assays were carried out at the same temperature, regardless of the temperature  that the fish were kept at. Macrophages of all species other than snakeheads  inhibited fungal germination at both temperatures, though only silver barb and  gourami macrophages could inhibit germling growth. PMA increased the respiratory  burst in nearly all cases. The respiratory burst in the presence of A. invadans  was consistently lower than that of controls, though the difference was only  significant in the case of snakeheads. The respiratory burst of all macrophage  treatments was higher at a low temperature. Except in the case of PMA-stimulated  macrophages, regressions between respiratory burst and inhibitory action were  only found in susceptible species, suggesting that the respiratory burst is  important in those species, but is unable to prevent the proliferation of A.  invadans. Serum inhibited fungal germination in all cases other than low  temperature tilapia, indicating that the EUS resistance of tilapia is not due to  the serum. Inhibition of germling growth by serum only occurred in silver barbs  and gourami. Heated serum did not inhibit germination in any case except that of  high temperature snakehead, and in fact stimulated germination in the case of  tilapia. Heating serum did not affect the growth inhibiting activity of silver  barbs and gouramis, but it stimulated growth in some groups. At high temperatures  snakeheads had high anti-A. invadans antibody concentrations, which may explain  the inhibitory activity of their heated serum.

Variations in  environmental conditions, as those caused by contaminants, may lead to  neurochemical impairments altering the pattern of the behavioural repertoire of  the species. Atrazine (ATZ) is an herbicide widely used in agriculture that is  frequently detected in surface water, affecting non-target species. The zebrafish  is a valuable model organism to assess behavioural and neurochemical effects of  different contaminants since it presents a robust behavioural repertoire and also  all major neurotransmitter systems described for mammalian species. The goal of  this study was to evaluate the effects of subchronic ATZ exposure in defensive  behaviours of zebrafish (shoaling, thigmotaxis, and depth preference) using the  split depth tank. Furthermore, to investigate a putative role of cholinergic  signalling on ATZ-mediated effects, we tested whether this herbicide alters  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in brain and muscle preparations. Fish were  exposed to ATZ for 14days and the following groups were tested: control (0.2%  acetone) and ATZ (10 and 1000μg/L).

Our results  showed that 1000μg/L ATZ significantly increased the inter-fish distance, as well  as the nearest and farthest neighbour distances. This group also presented an  increase in the shoal area with decreased social interaction. No significant  differences were detected for the number of animals in the shallow area, latency  to enter the shallow and time spent in shallow and deep areas of the apparatus,  but the ATZ 1000 group spent significantly more time near the walls. Although ATZ  did not affect muscular AChE, it significantly reduced AChE activity in brain.  Exposure to 10μg/L ATZ did not affect behaviour or AChE activity. These data  suggest that ATZ impairs defensive behaviours of zebrafish, which could be  related to its action on brain cholinergic neurotransmission. Moreover, the use  of the split depth tank could be an alternative strategy to assess group  behaviour and depth preference after exposure to chemical compounds.",2014-08,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,62-69,,,44,,Neurotoxicol Teratol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The 'golden humped tench' or tinca  gobba dorata, a variety of tench-Tinca tinca (L., 1758)-traditionally bred in  artificial ponds called peschiere in Poirino highlands, northwest Italy, is one  of such species. The aim of the study is to investigate the traditional farming  of the golden humped tench, the associated knowledge, practices, and gastronomy,  and to discuss the changes that the tench, the ponds, and their role in the local  social-ecological system are going through. METHODS: The data analyzed were  collected in different locations of Poirino highlands during May-September 2021.  Fieldwork included semi-structured interviews (n = 23) with current and former  tench farmers about the breeding and gastronomy of the tench and the management  of the peschiere. The interviewees' selection occurred through an exponential  non-discriminative snowball sampling, and interview transcripts were  qualitatively analyzed through inductive thematic content analysis. RESULTS: The  golden humped tench has been farmed for centuries in ponds used also to water  livestock and to irrigate cultivated fields, and managed by every peasant  household in the area. This integrated aquaculture system is underpinned by  detailed knowledge on the peschiera ecosystem and on the tench life cycle and  supports a gastronomic knowledge that is part of the local heritage. The ongoing  process of gastronomic valorization of the tench is sustaining the role of the  fish in locals' livelihoods and as a marker of regional identity, but it is also  transforming tench farming, already threatened by livelihood change, pesticides,  and invasive species, in controversial ways. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that ponds and  tenches are core elements of the local social-ecological system, defining the  cultural landscape and engendering a form of regional identity around them.  Studying integrated aquaculture systems and associated knowledge and practices is  relevant to design sustainable systems of food production and to address  possibilities of conservation of biodiversity and livelihoods in aquatic  environments.",11/04/2022,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,31,,1,18,,J Ethnobiol Ethnomed,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

Head kidney of fish is an important defense organ, playing  a vital part in antagonizing exogenous hazardous matter. The objective of this  study was to characterize toxic mechanisms of GLY in head kidney of common carp  based on transcriptome profiling. After 45-days exposure of GLY at  environmentally relevant concentrations, juvenile common carp were used as  experimental subjects to analyze how the head kidney responded to GLY. The  transcriptome profiling identified 1381 different expressed genes (DEGs) between  the control and exposure groups (5 and 50 mg/L). Functional analysis of DEGs  substantiated over-representative pathways mainly involving cellular stress  responses, cell proliferation and turnover, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and  innate immune processes in both treated groups compared with the control group.  Predicted network of gene regulation indicated that GLY-induced tp53 played a  vital role in linking a battery of signals. Furthermore, the expression of 10  candidate genes by qRT-PCR aligned with transcriptional profiling. In addition,  western blotting analysis confirmed that GLY-induced apoptosis and cellular  proliferation were closely involved in activating MAKP signaling pathway and  lipid metabolism pathway in both treated groups. Collectively, these data  demonstrate that head kidney of juvenile common carp mainly leverages  upregulation of genes related to cell proliferation and turnover, apoptosis, and  lipid metabolism to combat sub-chronic exposure of GLY.

The functions of Ly-6 proteins  are diverse since their low sequence homology. Currently, the function of Ly-6D,  a member of Ly-6 family proteins, is completely unknown in teleost. In the  present study, we identified and characterized a Ly-6D homologue (named PoLy-6D)  from the teleost fish Paralichthys olivaceus and examined its immune function.  PoLy-6D possesses a hydrophobic signal peptide, a LU domain including a conserved  ""LXCXXC"" motif in N-terminus and a ""CCXXXXCN"" motif in C-terminus. Under normal  physiological condition, PoLy-6D expression distributes in all the examined  tissues, the highest three tissues are successively spleen, head kidney, and  blood. When infected by extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and  viral pathogen, PoLy-6D expression was induced and the patterns vary with  different types of microbial pathogens infection and different immune tissues. In  vitro experiment showed recombinant PoLy-6D (rPoLy-6D) inhibited the lysis of  rabbit red blood cells by serum and selectively improved bacterial survival in  serum. After serum were treated by antibody of rPoLy-6D, bacteriostatic effect of  serum was obviously enhanced. These results indicate the importance of PoLy-6D as  a complement regulator. rPoLy-6D possessed the binding activity to multiple  bacteria but did not exhibit antimicrobial activities. The interaction between  rPoLy-6D and bacteria suggests that PoLy-6D is involved in host clearance of  pathogens probably by serving as a receptor for pathogens. Overexpression of  PoLy-6D in vivo promoted the host defense against invading E. piscicida. These  findings add new insights into the regulation mechanism of the complement system  in teleost and emphasize the importance of Ly-6D products for the control of  pathogen infection.",2021-09,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,104104,,,122,,Dev Comp Immunol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The estuarine environment imposes stressful conditions to  the organisms that inhabit it, and this situation can alter their sensitivity to  many pollutants. The specificity of some biomarkers like metallothionein tissue  concentration is discussed in virtue of its dependence on salinity, which is  highly variable in estuaries. Examples of cholinesterase activity measurements  are also provided and criteria to select sensitive enzymes to detect pesticides  and toxins are discussed. Regarding non-specific biomarkers, toxic responses in  terms of antioxidant defenses and/or oxidative damage are also considered in this  review, focusing on invertebrate species. In addition, the presence of an  antioxidant gradient along the body of the estuarine polychaete Laeonereis acuta  (Nereididae) and its relationship to different strategies, which deal with the  generation of oxidative stress, is reviewed. Also, unusual antioxidant defenses  against environmental pro-oxidants are discussed, including the mucus secreted by  L. acuta. Disruption of osmoregulation by pollutants is of paramount importance  in several estuarine species. In some cases such as in the estuarine crab  Chasmagnathus granulatus, there is a trade off between bioavailability of  toxicants (e.g. metals) and their interaction with key enzymes such as  Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and carbonic anhydrase. Thus, the metal effect on  osmoregulation is also discussed in the present review. Finally, field case  studies with fish species like the croaker Micropogonias furnieri (Scianidae) are  used to illustrate the application of DNA damage and immunosuppressive responses  as potential biomarkers of complex mixture of pollutants.",2007-08,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,221-234,,01-Feb,146,,Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 17045848,,,,"Animals; Environmental Monitoring/*methods; Oxidative Stress/drug effects; Biomarkers/analysis/*metabolism; Invertebrates/chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism; Metallothionein/analysis/metabolism; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/*toxicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zebrafish larvae exposed to PBZ  exhibited locomotion hyperactivity with a high burst movement and swimming  pattern. In adult zebrafish, PBZ resulted in anxiolytic exploratory behavior,  while no significant results were found in social interaction, shoal making, and  predator avoidance behaviors. Interestingly, high dose PBZ exposure significantly  compromised the innate aggressive behavior of the adult fish. Biochemical assays  for oxidative stress, antioxidant response, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed  significant reductions in their relative contents. In conclusion, for the first  time, our behavior assays revealed that chronic PBZ exposure induced behavioral  alterations in both larvae and the adult zebrafish. Because PBZ is a widely-used  plant growth regulator, we suggest that it is necessary to conduct more thorough  tests for its biosafety and bioaccumulation.",27/06/2020,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,,,13,17,,Int J Environ Res Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 32605096  PMCID: PMC7369995,,,,"Animals; Ecosystem; Locomotion; Motor Activity; Behavior, Animal; Triazoles; biosafety; Larva/drug effects; *Zebrafish; *Anti-Anxiety Agents/toxicity; antioxidant response; anxiolytic behavior; Exploratory Behavior/*drug effects; Paclobutrazol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fish full life cycle (FLC) tests are  generally required only when toxicity, bioaccumulation, and persistence triggers  are met or when there is a suspicion of potential endocrine-disrupting  properties. This regulatory approach is based on a relationship between the  results of fish ELS and FLC studies first established more than 35 yrs ago.  Recently, this relationship has been challenged by some regulatory authorities,  and it has been recommended that more substances should undergo FLC testing. In  addition, a project proposal has been submitted to the Organisation for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) to develop a fish partial life cycle (PLC)  test including a reproductive assessment. Both FLC and PLC tests are animal- and  resource-intensive and technically challenging and should therefore be undertaken  only if there is clear evidence that they are necessary for coming to a  regulatory decision. The present study reports on an analysis of a database of  paired fish ELS and FLC endpoints for plant protection product active substances  from European Union draft assessment reports and the US Environmental Protection  Agency Office of Pesticide Programs Pesticide Ecotoxicity Database. Analysis of  this database shows a clear relationship between ELS and FLC responses, with  similar median sensitivity across substances when no-observed-effect  concentrations (NOECs) are compared. There was also no indication that  classification of a substance as a mammalian reproductive toxicant leads to more  sensitive effects in fish FLC tests than in ELS tests. Indeed, the response of  the ELS tests was generally more sensitive than the most sensitive reproduction  NOEC from a FLC test. This analysis indicates that current testing strategies and  guidelines are fit for purpose and that there is no need for fish full or partial  life cycle tests for most plant protection product active substances.",2014-08,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,1874-1878,,8,33,,Environ Toxicol Chem,,,,,,,,eng,© 2014 SETAC.,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 24799351,,,,Animals; Fish; Chronic; United States; Time Factors; Endocrine Disruptors/*toxicity; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Pesticide; Freshwater; Reproduction/*drug effects; Life Cycle Stages/*drug effects; Fishes/growth & development/*physiology; Agrochemicals/pharmacology/*toxicity; Early life stage; Ecotoxicology/*methods; Endpoint Determination; European Union; Full life cycle; Mammals/physiology; Plants/*drug effects; Saltwater,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The co-existence of inducers and inhibitors of cytochrome P450-dependent  monooxygenases (CYP1A) is typical of complex environmental mixtures and requires  modifications of the in vivo EROD assay: For this end, zebrafish embryos were  used to evaluate the EROD-modifying potentials of common single-compound  exposures as well as binary mixtures with the PAH-type Ah-receptor agonist  β-naphthoflavone. For chemical testing, chlorpyrifos and Aroclor 1254 were  selected; β-naphthoflavone served as maximum EROD induction control. Chlorpyrifos  (≤EC(10)) could be documented to be a strong CYP1A inhibitor causing  characteristic edema-related toxicity. Aroclor 1254 resulted in inhibition of  CYP1A catalytic activity in a concentration- and specific time-dependent manner.  Next to a fast CYP1A induction, CYP1A inhibition could also be detected after 3h  short-term exposure of zebrafish embryos to chlorpyrifos. This communication also  describes techniques for the quantification of fluorescence signals via  densitometry as a basis for subsequent statistical assessment. The co-exposure  approach with zebrafish embryos accounts for the nature of potential interaction  between CYP1A inducers and inhibitors and thus pays tribute to the complexity of  environmental mixtures. The co-exposure EROD live-imaging assay thus facilitates  a better understanding of mixture effects and allows a better assessment and  interpretation of (embryo) toxic potentials.",15/02/2018,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,330-347,,,615,,Sci Total Environ,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2017.

Integrated analysis of biochemical,  histopathological and genetic parameters in fish exposed to Malathion insecticide  provide information on the toxicity mechanisms of this pesticide, which is  classified as a probable carcinogen for humans. The present study assessed the  biological responses of Colossoma macropomum after exposure to Malathion. We  started determining the lethal concentration, which is the concentration capable  of killing 50% of the subjects in an acute toxicity test (LC(50)-96 h), which was  15.77 ± 3.30 mgL(-1). The fish were, then, exposed to Malathion during 96 h at a  sublethal concentration, 7.30 mgL(-1).

However, fish exposed to insecticide presented severe gill  histopathological damage and increased expression of proto-oncogene ras. Taken  together, the results suggest that, after four days of exposure to the Malathion,  C. macropomum efficiently activates its defense mechanisms, suggesting that the  basal response mechanisms are responsive. On the other hand, histopathologic  damages evidenced the adverse effects of Malathion on fish, since it promoted  gill necrosis and increased the expression of ras oncogene that is directly  related to tumorigenesis events.",01/12/2020,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,111340,,,205,,Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Full-grown  post-vitellogenic ovarian follicles were incubated in vitro with prochloraz,  Luteinizing Hormone (LH), or a combination of prochloraz and LH. The occurrence  of oocyte maturation was assessed by monitoring germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD)  after 62-h in vitro incubation. Experiments were repeated in presence of  actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or trilostane. The effect of prochloraz on the  production of 17,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20βP), the natural  maturation-inducing steroid, was quantified by radioimmunoassay. In addition, the  effect of prochloraz on ovarian expression of 12 genes was monitored by real-time  PCR. Prochloraz (10(-5)M) administered alone was able to induce 100% GVBD in the  most responsive females. The occurrence of GVBD observed after prochloraz  stimulation of follicles originating from various females was similar and highly  correlated with the occurrence of GVBD observed after stimulation with low LH  concentration. In addition, oocyte maturation induced by LH or prochloraz was  totally inhibited by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and trilostane. Similarly to  LH, prochloraz was able to trigger 17,20βP production by the ovarian follicle.  Finally, prochloraz induced the overexpression of genes participating in 17,20βP  production, intercellular communication, and paracrine control of preovulatory  follicular differentiation such as igf, igf2, connexin 43, and 20β hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase (hsbd20). Together, our results demonstrate that prochloraz  administered alone is able to trigger oocyte maturation through the induction of  specific genes, some of them being also triggered by LH.

Edwardsiella  piscicida, a severe fish pathogen, has been shown to encode several thioredoxins  including TrxA, TrxC, and TrxH, but their biological roles remain unknown. In  this study, we characterized TrxH of E. piscicida (named TrxH(Ep)) and examined  its expression and function. TrxH(Ep) is composed of 125 residues and possesses  typical thioredoxin H motifs. Expression of trxH(Ep) was upregulated under  conditions of oxidative stress, iron starvation, low pH, and during infection of  host cells. trxH(Ep) expression was also regulated by ferric uptake regulator  (Fur), an important global regulatory of E. piscicida. Compared to the wild type  TX01, a markerless trxH(Ep) in-frame mutant strain TX01∆trxH exhibited markedly  compromised tolerance of the pathogen to hydrogen peroxide, acid stress, and iron  deficiency. Deletion of trxH(Ep) significantly retarded bacterial biofilm growth  and decreased resistance against serum killing. Pathogenicity analysis shows that  the inactivation of trxH(Ep) significantly impaired the ability of E. piscicida  to invade host cells, reproduce in macrophages, and infect host tissues.  Introduction of a trans-expressed trxH gene restored the lost virulence of  TX01∆trxH. There is likely to be a complex relationship of functional  complementation or expression regulation between TrxH and another two  thioredoxins, TrxA and TrxC, of E. piscicida. This is the first functional report  of TrxH in fish pathogens, and the findings suggest that TrxH(Ep) is essential  for coping with adverse circumstances and contributes to host infection of E.  piscicida.",15/04/2019,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,26,,1,50,,Vet Res,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 30992061  PMCID: PMC6466703,,,,"Animals; Virulence; Amino Acid Sequence; Sequence Alignment; *Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; *Transcriptome; Adaptation, Physiological/genetics; Bacterial Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism; Edwardsiella/genetics/*pathogenicity/*physiology; Thioredoxin h/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequences of MCSF have been identified in multiple teleost  species, however, the functional investigations of MCSF were documented in only a  few species. In this study, we examined the biological activity and the  immunomodulatory property of a MCSF homologue, PoMCSF, from Japanese flounder  (Paralichthys olivaceus). Structural analysis showed that PoMCSF possesses  conserved structural characteristics of MCSF proteins, including a signal  peptide, a CSF-1 domain, and a transmembrane region closed to the C-terminal.  Under normal physiological condition, PoMCSF expression distributes in all the  examined tissues, the highest three tissues are blood, muscle, and head kidney.  When infected by extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and viral  pathogen, the PoMCSF expression patterns vary with different types of microbial  pathogens infection and different immune tissues. In vitro experiment showed  recombinant PoMCSF promoted the activity of macrophage. In vivo experiment  indicated that PoMCSF overexpression boosted the defensive ability of flounder  against Edwardsiella piscicida, a severe fish pathogen that infects multiple  species of economically important fish, and regulated the expression of multiple  immune-related genes. To explore the relationship between PoMCSF and its receptor  PoMCSFR, anti-PoMCSFR antibody was prepared and PoMCSFR knockdown was conducted.  The neutralization assay showed that when PoMCSFR was neutralized by its  antibody, the role of PoMCSF on host defense against E. piscicida was weakened.  Knockdown of PoMCSFR impaired the phagocytic capacity of macrophages.

We recently described in situ design of femtomolar reversible  inhibitors of fish and mammalian acetylcholinesterases (EC 3.1.1.7; AChEs) using  several different libraries of acetylene and azide building blocks. Active center  gorge geometries of those AChEs are rather similar and identical triazole  inhibitors were detected in situ when incubating the same building block  libraries in different AChEs. Drosophila melanogaster AChE crystal structure and  other insect AChE homology models differ more in their overall 3D structure than  other members of the cholinesterase family. The portion of the gorge proximal to  the catalytic triad and choline binding site has a approximately 50% reduction in  volume, and the gorge entrance at the peripheral anionic site (PAS) is more  constricted than in the fish and mammalian AChEs. In this communication we  describe rationale for using purified recombinant Drosophila AChE as a template  for in situ reaction of tacrine and propidium based libraries of acetylene and  azide building blocks. The structures of resulting triazole inhibitors  synthesized in situ are expected to differ appreciably from the fish and  mammalian AChEs. While the latter AChEs exclusively promote synthesis of  syn-substituted triazoles, the best Drosophila AChE triazole inhibitors were  always anti-substituted. The anti-regioisomer triazoles were by about one order  of magnitude better inhibitors of Drosophila than mammalian and fish AChEs.  Moreover, the preferred site of acetylene+azide reaction in insect AChE and the  resulting triazole ring formation shifts from near the base of the gorge to  closer to its rim due to substantial differences of the gorge geometry in  Drosophila AChE. Thus, in addition to synthesizing high affinity, lead inhibitors  in situ, freeze-frame, click chemistry has capacity to generate species-specific  AChE ligands that conform to the determinants in the gorge.",25/09/2008,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,161-165,,01-Mar,175,,Chem Biol Interact,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Ireland PMID: 18555981  PMCID: PMC2585062,,,,"Humans; Animals; Models, Molecular; Acetylcholinesterase/*chemistry; Catalytic Domain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although banned, the continued release from  pre-banned products allows them to persist at toxic levels in the environment.  This is especially the case in lipid rich food webs of the Arctic, where PCBs  accumulate due to both long-range atmospheric transport and locally contaminated  sites such as formerly used defense (FUD) sites. At the request of the leadership  of the Qawalangin Tribe of Unalaska Island in the Aleutian Archipelago, we  analyzed PCB concentrations in samples of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus  aculeatus) and subsistence foods (i.e., salmonid species and blue mussels  [Mytilus edulis]) collected at both FUD and non-FUD sites. PCBs were extracted  from samples using a QuEChERS method. The mean PCB concentrations across all  mussel samples was 6.1 ppb; mussels from FUD sites had nearly double the PCB  concentrations (7.6 ppb) compared to non-military sites (3.9 ppb), and at two FUD  sites the PCB concentrations exceeded safe consumption guidelines. The mean total  PCB concentration for fish was 2.8 ppb; fish PCB concentrations were higher at  FUD sites (3.2 ppb) compared to non-military sites (1.2 ppb). These results  support the need to remediate the FUD sites of ""Building 551/T Dock to Airport""  and ""Delta Western"".

OBJECTIVES: Our study had two  primary objectives: (i) Characterize the sources and predictors of a suite of  eight PCBs, four organochlorine (OC) pesticides, five essential and five toxic  elements in serum and/or whole blood of pregnant women recruited as part of the  Mother-and-Child Contaminant Cohort Study conducted in Northern Norway (The MISA  study); and (ii) determine the influence of personal and social characteristics  on both dietary and contaminant factors. METHODS: Recruitment and sampling  started in May 2007 and continued for the next 31 months until December 2009.  Blood/serum samples were collected during the 2nd trimester (mean: 18.2 weeks,  range 9.0-36.0). A validated questionnaire was administered to obtain personal  information. The samples were analysed by established laboratories employing  verified methods and reference standards. PCA involved Varimax rotation, and  significant predictors (p≤0.05) in linear regression models were included in the  multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS: When considering all the  contaminants, three prominent PCA axes stood out with prominent loadings of: all  POPs; arsenic, selenium and mercury; and cadmium and lead. Respectively, in the  multivariate models the following were predictors: maternal age, parity and  consumption of freshwater fish and land-based wild animals; marine fish;  cigarette smoking, dietary PCA axes reflecting consumption of grains and cereals,  and food items involving hunting. PCA of only the POPs separated them into two  axes that, in terms of recently published findings, could be understood to  reflect longitudinal trends and their relative contributions to summed POPs.  CONCLUSIONS: The linear combinations of variables generated by PCA identified  prominent dietary sources of OC groups and of prominent toxic elements and  highlighted the importance of maternal characteristics.",2015-03,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,254-264,,2,218,,Int J Hyg Environ Health,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

The objective of our study was to analyse interaction of  environmental contaminants with zebrafish Mate7 using a newly developed high  throughput screening (HTS) Mate7 assay. A full-length zebrafish mate7 sequence  was obtained from zebrafish cDNA originating from male kidney, and a stable  expression of Mate7 in genetically engineered HEK293 Flp-In cells was achieved.  Stable Mate7 transfectants were then used for development and optimization of a  new HTS cellular uptake protocol, with DAPI and ASP + as model fluorescent  substrates.

A series of 89 diverse  environmental contaminants, including industrial chemicals, pesticides, and  pharmaceuticals, was tested and highly effective Mate7 interactors were  identified in all of the aforementioned groups. Some of the inhibitors identified  could be of environmental concern because they may potentially impair Mate7  efflux function, lowering the fish defence capacity against environmental  contaminants, or interfering with transport of yet unidentified physiological  substrates.

The goal of this study  was to evaluate the effects of diazinon exposure on fish and to investigate the  potential of the HSP inducer (HSPi) in developing a defense mechanism. To achieve  this, several factors were analyzed, including the HSP70 gene expression, levels  of immunity markers (lysozyme, IgM, and C3), antioxidant status, and the activity  of acetylcholine esterase (AChE). Stellate sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus) fry,  was exposed to diazinon (25, 50, and 75% of 96h-LC50) for 6 days after  pre-treatment with an HSP inducer (HSPi), TEX-OE® (a prickly pear cactus  extract), for 4 hours. Two HSPi concentrations, 100 and 200 mg.L-1, were used.  Pre-treatment with HSPi significantly enhanced HSP70 gene expression in the gill  and liver, as well as immune markers in the blood of Acipenser stellatus.  Diazinon-treated groups exhibited higher antioxidant activities of SOD, CAT, and  T-AOC. Increased activity also observed in control fish pre-treated with HSPi.  However, stellate sturgeon receiving both diazinon and HSPi+diazinon experienced  a significant decrease in AChE activity in comparison with control group.  Cortisol levels were elevated in the fish that were subjected to diazinon. Those  subjected to diazinon after receiving HSPi showed a significant decrease in  cortisol levels. In conclusion, the study suggests that HSPi-mediated HSP70  induction may have a protective effect. The presence of an HSP inducer offers a  potential strategy to mitigate the consequences of diazinon exposure in stellate  sturgeon.",2023,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,e0294188,,11,18,,PLoS One,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright: © 2023 Vahdatiraad et al.

In this work, we  report that Phdp secretes large amounts of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) when  cultured in vitro and during in vivo infection. These OMVs were morphologically  characterized and the most abundant vesicle-associated proteins were identified.  We also demonstrate that Phdp OMVs protect Phdp cells from the bactericidal  activity of fish antimicrobial peptides, suggesting that secretion of OMVs is  part of the strategy used by Phdp to evade host defense mechanisms. Importantly,  the vaccination of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) with adjuvant-free crude OMVs  induced the production of anti-Phdp antibodies and resulted in partial protection  against Phdp infection.

Nonetheless, consuming sport fish from the Great Lakes increases exposure to  certain persistent organic pollutants, namely polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)  and organochlorine insecticides, which may increase the risk of cancer. Evidence  that exposure to persistent organic pollutants is associated with colorectal  cancer is sparse. We examined colorectal cancer incidence in the New York State  Angler Cohort Study (NYSACS), a prospective cohort of 17,110 anglers and spouses  age 18-40 years at enrollment. In 1991, participants completed a mailed  self-administered questionnaire that ascertained the number of years that fish  from Lake Ontario were consumed, as well as potential confounders. Forty-one  histologically confirmed first primary incident colorectal cancers diagnosed as  of December 31, 2008 were identified via the New York State Cancer Registry.  Vital status was ascertained by linkage with the Social Security Administration  Death File.

Although consumption of Lake Ontario  sport fish may have an inverse association with colorectal cancer risk,  inferences are complicated by a small number of cases and a lack of information  regarding potential confounders including other dietary factors.

Four adult males and two ovulated  females were placed in the aquarium together with eight mature male parr. Four of  the parr were exposed during the previous 4 days to two concentrations (0.1 or  1.0 microgl(-1)) of the pyrethroid pesticide cypermethrin (a disrupter of  olfactory receptor function) and four of the parr to the solvent ethanol. The  behaviour of all fish was followed for 24h and then blood and milt was collected.  Exposure to the higher concentration of cypermethrin disturbed the reproductive  behaviour of the parr. They displayed fewer courting events, spent less time near  the nesting females and had lower volumes of strippable milt. They also had  significantly lower amounts of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) in the blood plasma  than the control group. The higher cypermethrin group also had significantly  lower levels of all these variables than the lower cypermethrin group, apart from  strippable milt that showed no significant differences between two groups.

Reliable indicators still  need to be found in order to properly assess the impact of pesticides in fish.  After an in vivo chronic exposure to pendimethalin, the detoxification process  and the antioxidant defense system were assessed in 120 adult rainbow trout,  Oncorhynchus mykiss. Four nominal exposure conditions were tested: control (C),  500 ng L(-1) (P500), 800 ng L(-1) (P800) and the commercial formulation Prowl(®)  at 500 ng L(-1) (Pw500).

At D43, EROD activity in fish exposed to the  commercial product was lower than in control fish, which may be explained by the  high presence of herbicide in fish (613±163 ng g bile(-1)). Furthermore,  antioxidant defense responses were set up by trout in gills and liver following  chronic exposure to 800 ng L(-1) of pendimethalin concentration.

Three types of lysozymes have been identified in metazoan, the c-type (chicken or  conventional), the g-type (goose-type) and the i-type (invertebrate type). They  are all involved in the hydrolysation of the bacterial cell wall. Our work has  been focused on the molecular characterization, expression analysis by real-time  PCR, both at basal condition and after in vivo challenges, and 3D structural  studies on the g-type lysozyme from sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.). Moreover,  a recombinant sea bass lysozyme has been produced in Escherichia coli and used to  investigate the activity of the enzyme at different pH and temperatures and to  perform antibacterial assays against typical fish pathogens. The cloned sea bass  cDNA for g-type lysozyme (accession number FN667957) consists of 742 bp and  translates for a putative protein of 188 amino acids. The molecular weight is  20.251, 41Da with a theoretical pI of 8.53, two cysteine residues along the  sequence and no putative signal peptide. These features of the enzyme are in  agreement with the expected characteristics of a proper g-type lysozyme, except  for the cysteine residues that in fish are quite variable in number. An alignment  between known g-type lysozyme sequences evidences that the amino acid residues  thought to be involved in the enzyme catalysis (Glu(71), Asp(84) and Asp(95) in  sea bass) are quite well conserved between mammalian, avian and fish sequences.  The sea bass g-type lysozyme gene is composed of four exons and three introns and  this gene structure is more compact compared to other known fish lysozyme  homologues. Modeling of 3D structure has been performed on the template structure  of g-type lysozyme from Atlantic cod. The catalytic site appears well conserved  when compared with known structures of fish g-type lysozymes (cod and salmon).  The basal expression of lysozyme transcripts is highest in gills, followed by  head kidney and peripheral blood leukocytes. The lysozyme expression is up  regulated in head kidney leukocytes both after challenge with the fish bacterial  pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida. The lytic activity, determined  using as substrate Micrococcus lysodeikticus, was optimal at pH 5.5 and at a  temperature of 30°C.

Here, Pseudoalteromonas piscicida WCPW15003 as a probiotic effectively  antagonized dominant pathogenic V. harveyi in a mariculture, with a  growth-of-inhibition ratio of 6.3 h(-1). The antagonistic activities of cells and  intracellular components of WCPW15003 made a greater contribution to the  antagonistic process than did extracellular metabolites and caused the dominance  of WCPW15003 during the antagonistic process in vitro. WCPW15003 was safe for the  pearl gentian grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ Epinephelus lanceolatus)  and, as a consequence of the antagonistic effect on V. harveyi, protected the  fish from an immune response in vivo. A comprehensive combined proteomics and  metabolomics analysis of antagonistic WCPW15003 and pathogenic V. harveyi in a  coculture compared to a monoculture was performed to investigate the antagonistic  molecular mechanisms. The results showed that during the antagonistic process,  WCPW15003 in a coculture had significantly downregulated metabolic pathways for  histidine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism, and  upregulated glycerophospholipid metabolism, leading to a competitive advantage  against the co-occurring species, V. harveyi. This defined a mechanism by which  multi-costimulatory pathways drove P. piscicida WCPW15003 against V. harveyi.  IMPORTANCE V. harveyi as a dominant pathogen has become a major hazard in  mariculture development and seafood safety, and biocontrol of this pathogen using  antagonistic probiotic agents is a long-standing biological challenge. P.  piscicida WCPW15003 has promise as a novel, safe, and effective bioagent for  specifically inhibiting dominant pathogenic V. harveyi and protects mariculture  animals from infection by this pathogen by moderating the host immune response,  which is heavily driven by multi-costimulatory pathways in a coculture of  WCPW15003 and V. harveyi. This work identified a direction for comprehensively  elucidating the molecular mechanism of WCPW15003 antagonism against the dominant  pathogen in mariculture using modern molecular biology techniques and provided  deep insights into the advantages and potential of this antagonistic probiotic  against V. harveyi for the construction of an environmentally friendly,  recirculating mariculture system.",21/12/2022,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,e0244422,,6,10,,Microbiol Spectr,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 36301131  PMCID: PMC9769913,,,,Animals; Metabolomics; Proteomics; *Bass; *Fish Diseases/prevention & control; *Vibrio Infections/prevention & control/veterinary; *Vibrio/physiology; antagonistic bacteria; costimulatory pathway; immune response; pathogenic Vibrio harveyi; proteomic combined metabolomic analysis; recirculating-mariculture system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The EU has banned the use of  antibiotics and other chemicals, which have been shown to be effective in  promoting growth and reducing environment pollutants because of the risk caused  to humans by chemical residues in food and by antibiotic resistance being passed  on to human pathogens. As a result of this, scientists have intensified efforts  in exploiting plants, plant extracts or natural plant compounds as potential  natural alternatives for enhancing the livestock productivity. This paper  discusses work on the effects of various phytochemicals and plant secondary  metabolites in ruminant and fish species. The focus is on (i) plants such as  Ananas comosus (pine apple), Momordica charantia (bitter gourd) and Azadirachta  indica (neem) containing anthelmintic compounds and for their use for controlling  internal parasites; (ii) plants containing polyphenols and their applications for  protecting proteins from degradation in the rumen, increasing efficiency of  microbial protein synthesis in rumen and decreasing methane emission; for using  as antioxidants, antibacterial and antihelmintic agents; and for changing meat  colour and for increasing n-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid in meat;  (iii) saponin-rich plants such as quillaja, yucca and Sapindus saponaria for  increasing the efficiency of rumen fermentation, decreasing methane emission and  enhancing growth; for producing desired nutritional attributes such as lowering  of cholesterol in monogastric animals; for increasing growth of fish (common carp  and Nile tilapia) and for changing male to female ratio in tilapia; and for use  as molluscicidal agents; (iv) Moringa oleifera leaves as a source of plant growth  factor(s), antioxidants, beta-carotene, vitamin C, and various glucosinolates and  their degraded products for possible use as antibacterial, antioxidant,  anticarcinogenic and antipest agents; (v) Jatropha curcas toxic variety with high  levels of various phytochemicals such as trypsin inhibitor, lectin, phytate and  phorbol esters in seeds limiting the use of seed meal in fish and livestock  diets; and the use of phorbol esters as bio-pesticidal agent; and (vi)  lesser-known legumes such as Entada phaseoloides seeds containing high levels of  trypsin inhibitor and saponins, Sesbania aculeate seeds rich in non-starch  polysaccharides and Mucuna pruriens var. utilis seeds rich in  l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and their potential as fish feed; Cassia fistula  seeds as a source of antioxidants; and the use of Canavalia ensiformis, C.  gladiata and C. virosa seeds containing high levels of trypsin inhinitor, lectins  and canavanine.

The ""smooth""  pattern was typically shown as a normal movement behavior, while the ""shaking""  pattern was frequently observed after treatments of diazinon. These smooth and  shaking patterns were selected for training with an artificial neural network.  Parameters characterizing the movement tracks, such as speed, degree of backward  movements, stop duration, turning rate, meander, and maximum distance movements  in the y-axis of 1-min duration, were given as input (six nodes) to a multi-layer  perceptron with the back propagation algorithm.

In this context, Roundup(®), a glyphosate-based herbicide,  has been widely detected in natural water bodies, representing a potential threat  to non-target organisms, namely fish. Thus, the main goal of the present study  was to evaluate the genotoxic potential of Roundup(®) in the teleost fish  Anguilla anguilla, addressing the possible causative involvement of oxidative  stress. Fish were exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of this  herbicide (58 and 116 μgL(-1)) during one or three days. The standard procedure  of the comet assay was applied to gill and liver cells in order to determine  organ-specific genetic damage. Since liver is a central organ in xenobiotic  metabolism, nucleoids of hepatic cells were also incubated with a lesion-specific  repair enzyme (formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase - FPG), in order to recognise  oxidised purines. Antioxidants were determined in both organs as indicators of  pro-oxidant state. In general, both organs displayed an increase in DNA damage  for the two Roundup(®) concentrations and exposure times, although liver showed  to be less susceptible to the lower concentration. The enzyme-modified comet  assay showed the occurrence of FPG-sensitive sites in liver only after a 3-day  exposure to the higher Roundup(®) concentration. The antioxidant defences were in  general unresponsive, despite a single increment of catalase activity in gills  (116 μgL(-1), 3-day) and a decrease of superoxide dismutase activity in liver (58  μgL(-1), 3-day). Overall, the mechanisms involved in Roundup(®)-induced DNA  strand-breaks showed to be similar in both organs. Nevertheless, it was  demonstrated that the type of DNA damage varies with the concentration and  exposure duration. Hence, after 1-day exposure, an increase on pro-oxidant state  is not a necessary condition for the induction of DNA-damaging effects of  Roundup(®). By increasing the duration of exposure to three days, ROS-dependent  processes gained preponderance as a mechanism of DNA-damage induction in the  higher concentration.",18/03/2012,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,01-Sep,,01-Feb,743,,Mutat Res,,,,,,,,eng,© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Crayfish are polytrophic, meaning that they  feed on and become prey for all levels of the aquatic food web as well as are  also important for the transfer of energy between benthic and terrestrial food  webs. Because crayfish are a keystone species, it is important to investigate any  factors that may affect their population size. Crayfish are active at night and  rely heavily on their sensory appendages (e.g., antennulues, maxillipeds, and  pereopods) to localize food sources. In this experiment, we investigated the  effects of atrazine (ATR) exposure on the chemosensory responses of male and  female crayfish to food odors. We exposed crayfish to environmentally relevant,  sublethal levels of ATR [80 ppb (µg/L)] for 72 h and then examined the behavioral  responses of both ATR-treated and control crayfish to food odor delivered from  one end of a test arena. We used Noldus Ethovision XT software to measure odor  localization and locomotory behaviors of crayfish in response to food (fish)  odor. We found that control crayfish spent more time in the proximal region of  the test arena and at the odor source compared with ATR-treated crayfish.  Furthermore, there were no differences in the time spent moving and not moving,  total distance travelled in the tank, and walking speed (cm/s) when control and  ATR-treated crayfish were compared.

Cellular atrophy, pillar cells changes,  filament epithelium hyperplasia and hypertrophy, lamellar epithelium hyperplasia  were the most frequent histopathology. MRC in the filament epithelium decreased  after exposure to 24 h and increased after 96 h indicating possible transitory  osmo-ionic disruption. P. lineatus exhibited high tolerance to MgHP. The  increased GST activity and GSH levels after 96 h exposure suggested possible MgHP  accumulation and concentration- and time-dependent response. Histopathology in  the gills of exposed fish occurred at high MgHP concentrations.

This  study aimed to elucidate the effects of chlorothalonil on biochemical biomarkers  of oxidative stress in tissues of the fish Danio rerio. To achieve this, animals  were exposed for 4 and 7 days, to nominal concentrations of chlorothalonil at 0  μg/L (DMSO, 0.001%), 0.1 μg/L and 10 μg/L, and after the exposure period, the  tissues (gills and liver) were removed for biochemical analysis. Antioxidant  capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and enzyme activities, such as  superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and  glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), were evaluated in both tissues. In addition, the  concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced glutathione (GSH) and  lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were also analysed. A significant increase in ROS  concentration, ACAP levels, GST and GCL activities and a significant reduction of  LPO levels in gills exposed to the highest concentration were observed after 4  days. However, there was a significant reduction of ACAP and CAT activity, as  well as a significant increase of GST activity and LPO levels in gills exposed to  the lower concentration after 7 days. The liver was less affected, presenting a  significant reduction in CAT activity and LPO levels after 4 days. However, a  significant increase in SOD activity and LPO levels occurred after 7 days. These  results indicate that chlorothalonil, after 4 days, caused activation of the  antioxidant defence system in gills of animals exposed to the highest  concentration. However, after 7 days, the lowest concentration of this compound  caused oxidative stress in this same organ. Also, the results show that gills  were more affected than the liver, probably because gills can be involved in  chlorothalonil metabolisation. Therefore, it is possible that the liver could be  exposed to lower chlorothalonil concentrations or less toxic metabolites due to  the metabolism taking place in the gills.",2020-08,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,105527,,,225,,Aquat Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AIP56 is a single-chain AB toxin composed by two domains connected  by an unstructured linker peptide flanked by two cysteine residues that form a  disulphide bond. The A domain comprises a zinc-metalloprotease moiety that  cleaves the NF-kB p65, and the B domain is involved in binding and  internalisation of the toxin into susceptible cells. Previous experiments  suggested that disruption of AIP56 disulphide bond partially compromised  toxicity, but conclusive evidences supporting the importance of that bond in  intoxication were lacking.

We also show that the host cell thioredoxin reductase-thioredoxin  system is involved in AIP56 intoxication by reducing the disulphide bond of the  toxin at the cytosol.

Recent studies demonstrated that E. piscicida can  invade and survive within multiple nonphagocytic cells, but the internalization  mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we used HeLa cells as a nonphagocytic  cell model to investigate the endocytic strategy used by the pathogenic E.  piscicida isolate EIB202. Using a combination of optical and electron microscopy,  we observed obvious membrane ruffles and F-actin rearrangements in HeLa cells  after EIB202 infection. We also revealed that EIB202 internalization  significantly depended on the activity of Na(+)/H(+) exchangers and multiple  intracellular signaling events related to macropinocytosis, suggesting that E.  piscicida utilizes the host macropinocytosis pathway to enter HeLa cells.  Further, using inhibitory drugs and shRNAs to block specific endocytic pathways,  we found that a caveolin-dependent but not clathrin-dependent pathway is involved  in E. piscicida entry and that its entry requires dynamin and membrane  cholesterol. Together, these data suggest that E. piscicida enters nonphagocytic  cells via macropinocytosis and caveolin-dependent endocytosis involving  cholesterol and dynamin, improving the understanding of how E. piscicida  interacts with nonphagocytic cells.IMPORTANCE Bacterial internalization is the  first step in breaking through the host cell defense. Therefore, studying the  mechanism of bacterial internalization improves the understanding of the  pathogenic mechanism of bacteria. In this study, the internalization process on  nonphagocytic cells by Edwardsiella piscicida was evaluated.

In our current study, zebrafish, an ideal model  animal for behavioral studies, were exposed to cyprodinil from fertilization to  240 days postfertilization at 0.1 μg/L (environmentally relevant concentration)  and 1, 10 μg/L. Firstly, we observed that aggressive behavior of zebrafish was  significantly enhanced after exposure to 0.1-10 μg/L cyprodinil and antipredator  behavior was decreased after exposure. Cyprodinil exposure altered the  adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels, which regulate cortisol  homeostasis and were significantly reduced in all exposure groups (0.1-10 μg/L).  In addition, most of the key genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal gland  axis, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone and melanocortin 2 receptor, were  downregulated significantly in all exposure groups, which was consistent with the  hormone levels. In addition, in the hypothalamus, the number of apoptotic cells  increased in a dose-dependent manner in the cyprodinil exposure groups.

Postharvest  loss management is one of the major concerns of the current century. It is  considered a critical challenge to food security for the rising global  population. However, to manage the postharvest loss, still, a large population  relies on chemical fungicides, which affect food quality and are hazardous to  health and the surrounding environment. However, the scientific community has  searched for alternatives for the last two decades. In this context, endophytic  microorganisms have emerged as an economical, sustainable, and viable option to  manage postharvest pathogens with integral colonization properties and eliciting  a defense response against pathogens.

The control fish from site B  was distinguished by weakness of antioxidant defence (measured from superoxide  dismutase and catalase activities, redox index of glutathione (GSH), superoxide  anion (O(2)) and lipid peroxidation levels), imbalance of the concentrations of  protein metallothionein (MT-SH) and MT-related metals (MT-Me) and neurotoxicity.  Differences in glutathione-S-transferase activity in the liver and  vitellogenin-like proteins in the serum were also showed between B and Z control  groups.

Children were recruited from three sites; an area  with natural contamination by fluoride and arsenic (F-As), a mining-metallurgical  area with lead and arsenic contamination (Pb-As) and a malaria zone with the  evidence of fish contaminated with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Children aged 6-11 years old, living in one of  the three polluted sites since birth were recruited (n=166). The exposure was  evaluated as follows: fluoride and arsenic in urine, lead in blood and DDT,  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and PCBs in serum. To evaluate the test  performance, z-scores for Copy and Immediate Recall were calculated. The  proportion of children by residence area with performance lower than expected by  age (below -1 SD) for Copy and Immediate Recall was in the F-As area (88.7% and  59%) and in the DDT-PCBs area (73% and 43.8%), respectively. In the Pb-As area,  the proportion was 62% for both tests.

Their effects at  environmentally relevant concentrations are often unclear, especially concerning  mixtures of pesticides. This study thus investigated the impacts of one of the  most used herbicides: S-metolachlor and its two metabolites, metolachlor oxanilic  acid (MOA) and metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (MESA) on the development of  zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Embryos were exposed to the individual  substances and their environmentally relevant mixture until 120 hpf (hours  post-fertilization). The focus was set on sublethal endpoints such as  malformations, hatching success, length of fish larvae, spontaneous movements,  heart rate and locomotion. Moreover, expression levels of eight genes linked to  the thyroid system disruption, oxidative stress defense, mitochondrial  metabolism, regulation of cell cycle and retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway  were analyzed. Exposure to S-metolachlor (1 μg/L) and the pesticide mixture  (1 μg/L of each substance) significantly reduced spontaneous tail movements of  21 hpf embryos. Few rare developmental malformations were observed, but only in  larvae exposed to more than 100 μg/L of individual substances (craniofacial  deformation, non-inflated gas bladder, yolk sac malabsorption) and to 30 μg/L of  each substance in the pesticide mixture (spine deformation). No effect on  hatching success, length of larvae, heart rate or larvae locomotion were found.  Strong responses were detected at the molecular level including induction of p53  gene regulating the cell cycle (the pesticide mixture - 1 μg/L of each substance;  MESA 30 μg/L; and MOA 100 μg/L), as induction of cyp26a1 gene encoding cytochrome  P450 (pesticide mixture - 1 μg/L of each substance). Genes implicated in the  thyroid system regulation (dio2, thra, thrb) were all overexpressed by the  environmentally relevant concentrations of the pesticide mixture (1 μg/L of each  substance) and MESA metabolite (1 μg/L). Zebrafish thyroid system disruption was  revealed by the overexpressed genes, as well as by some related developmental  malformations (mainly gas bladder and yolk sac abnormalities), and reduced  spontaneous tail movements.

Production costs and  income are used to compare the systems' financial sustainability. The farmers'  perception on how their farming practices influence on ecosystem services and  their livelihoods are used as an indication of the systems' ecological and social  sustainability. Although rice-fish farmers used lower amount of pesticides and  fertilisers than rice farmers, there were no statistical differences in their  rice yields or net income. Rice was seen as the most important ecosystem service  from rice fields and related wetlands, but also several other ecosystem services,  such as water quality, aquatic animals, plants, habitats, and natural enemies to  pests, were seen as important to the farmers' livelihoods and wellbeing.

We  hypothesized this antioxidant effect may reduce oxidative stress in primary  mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) disease, improving cellular viability and  organismal health. Here, we systematically evaluated the therapeutic potential of  cysteamine bitartrate in RC disease models spanning three evolutionarily distinct  species. These pre-clinical studies demonstrated the narrow therapeutic window of  cysteamine bitartrate, with toxicity at millimolar levels directly correlating  with marked induction of hydrogen peroxide production. Micromolar range  cysteamine bitartrate treatment in Caenorhabditis elegans gas-1(fc21) RC complex  I (NDUFS2-/-) disease invertebrate worms significantly improved mitochondrial  membrane potential and oxidative stress, with corresponding modest improvement in  fecundity but not lifespan. At 10 to 100 μm concentrations, cysteamine bitartrate  improved multiple RC complex disease FBXL4 human fibroblast survival, and  protected both complex I (rotenone) and complex IV (azide) Danio rerio vertebrate  zebrafish disease models from brain death. Mechanistic profiling of cysteamine  bitartrate effects showed it increases aspartate levels and flux, without  increasing total glutathione levels. Transcriptional normalization of broadly  dysregulated intermediary metabolic, glutathione, cell defense, DNA, and immune  pathways was greater in RC disease human cells than in C. elegans, with similar  rescue in both models of downregulated ribosomal and proteasomal pathway  expression. Overall, these data suggest cysteamine bitartrate may hold  therapeutic potential in RC disease, although not through obvious modulation of  total glutathione levels.

Aminotriazole  (ATA), an inhibitor of catalase (CAT), L-buthionine sulfoximine (L-BSO), an  inhibitor of glutathione (GSH) synthesis, and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a  glutathione precursor, were used to investigate the role of CAT and GSH redox  cycle in protection against the adrenal toxicity of endosulfan, a pesticide that  impairs cell viability (LC50 366 microM) and cortisol secretion (EC50 19 microM)  in a concentration-related manner. Pretreatment with ATA and L-BSO enhanced the  toxicity of endosulfan (LC50 and EC50, respectively, 302 and 2.6 microM with ATA,  346 and 3.1 microM with L-BSO), while pretreatment with NAC had no significant  effect on cell viability and increased the EC50 of endosulfan to 51 microM. CAT  activity was significantly reduced following exposure to endosulfan when cells  were pretreated with ATA. Pretreatment with L-BSO significantly decreased  glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in a  concentration-related manner following exposure to endosulfan, while GSH levels  were significantly higher in NAC pretreated cells compared to untreated cells.  Finally, pretreatment with ATA and L-BSO increased, while pretreatment with NAC  decreased, lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) levels.

In this  work, we generated mutants of V. anguillarum defective in FrpA and analyzed their  ability to use piscibactin as iron source. The results showed that inactivation  of frpA completely disables piscibactin utilization, and the original phenotype  could be restored by gene complementation, confirming that FrpA is the OMT that  mediates ferri-Pcb uptake. Additionally, the ability of several Pcb thiazole  analogues, with different configurations at positions 9, 10, and 13, to be  internalized through FrpA, was evaluated measuring their ability to promote  growth under iron deficiency of several indicator strains. The results showed  that while those analogues with a thiazole ring maintain almost the same activity  as Pcb, the maintenance of the hydroxyl group present in natural piscibactin  configuration at position C-13 is crucial for Fe(3+) chelation and, in  consequence, for the recognition of the ferri-siderophore by the cognate OMT.

Here, we  use early stages of zebrafish to evaluate glyphosate as pure active ingredient  and within a commercial formulation in terms of oxidative stress. Biomarkers  involved in the oxidative status were evaluated along with other markers of  neurotoxicity, genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, energy balance and motor performance,  and the selected tools were evaluated by its sensitivity in determining  early-warning events. Zebrafish embryos exposed to glyphosate active ingredient  and glyphosate-based formulation were under oxidative stress, but only the  commercial formulation delayed the embryogenesis, affected the cholinergic  neurotransmission and induced DNA damage. Both altered the motor performance of  larvae at very low concentrations, becoming larvae hypoactive. The energy balance  was also impaired, as embryos under oxidative stress had lower lipids reserves.  Although data suggest that glyphosate-based formulation has higher toxicity than  the active ingredient itself, the most sensitive biomarkers detected  early-warning effects at very low concentrations of the active ingredient.  Biochemical biomarkers of defense system and oxidative damage were the most  sensitive tools, detecting pro-oxidant responses at very low concentrations,  along with markers of motor performance that showed high sensitivity and high  throughput, suitable for detecting early effects linked to neurotoxicity.  Alterations on morphology during embryogenesis showed the lowest sensitivity,  thus morphological alterations appeared after several alterations at biochemical  levels.

Aquaponics  has a huge potential as a sustainable solution since it demonstrates promising  results for urban food development while providing new entrepreneurship and  start-up opportunities. Although it presents a big opportunity especially for  developing countries like Egypt, it still requires further studies and researches  to fully overcome foreseen challenges. This study discusses the possibility of  implementing aquaponics as an alternative to conventional agriculture in Egypt  through a comparison between aquaponics and conventional agriculture. The first  section of this investigation analyzes the economic feasibility of aquaponics in  terms of capital and operational expenditure costs. Then, an experimental  comparative study is carried out examining two pilot-scale aquaponics systems  (Deep water Culture system and Integrated Aqua-Vegaculture system), where crop  quality (vitamins, heavy metals, and pesticides residues) of the two systems has  been compared among each other, as well as to that of the commercially available  organic food available in supermarkets. Results indicated that both systems  produce high-quality safe organic food. The economic feasibility analysis  indicated that Integrated Aqua-Vegaculture System is producing more crops with a  wider variety of almost 20% less capital expenditure and operational expenditure  costs. Fish production for both systems was close, yet slightly higher in Deep  Water Culture. Although, on the short term, aquaponics entails relatively high  capital and operational expenditure costs compared with conventional agriculture;  yet, on the long term, it is more profitable, while saving up to 85% of the water  wasted by conventional farming techniques. Finally, the study discusses the main  limitations, drawbacks, and future of aquaponics in Egypt where public awareness  and a new mindset are needed to highlight the link between agriculture and  sustainability.",2019-06,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,15872-15883,,16,26,,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Germany PMID: 30955197,,,,"Animals; Agriculture; Egypt; Cichlids; Agriculture/economics/instrumentation/*methods; Aquaponics; Conventional agriculture; Corchorus/*growth & development; Crops, Agricultural/economics/growth & development; Deep water culture; Equipment Design; Food Quality; Food, Organic; Hydroponics/*methods; Integrated Aqua-Vegaculture; Lactuca/economics/*growth & development; Sustainable Development",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On Day 6, the larvae were tested for motility under  alternating dark and light conditions. Finally, at 5-7 months of age the exposed  fish and controls were tested on a battery of behavioral tests to assess  emotional function, sensorimotor response, social interaction and predator  evasion. These tests showed chemical-specific short-term effects of altered  motility in larvae in all of the tested compounds, and long-term impairment of  anxiety-related behavior in adults following IPP, BPDP, or EHDP exposures.

Recent phylogenomic investigations have  determined that bacteria historically classified as Edwardsiella tarda actually  represent three genetically distinct yet phenotypically ambiguous taxa with  various degrees of pathogenicity in different hosts. Previous recognition of  these taxa was hampered by the lack of a distinguishing phenotypic character.  Commercial test panel configurations are relatively constant over time, and as  new species are defined, appropriate discriminatory tests may not be present in  current test panel arrangements. While phenobiochemical tests fail to  discriminate between these taxa, data presented here revealed discriminatory  peaks for each Edwardsiella species using matrix-assisted laser desorption  ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) methodology, suggesting that MALDI-TOF can  offer rapid, reliable identification in line with current systematic  classifications. Furthermore, a multiplex PCR assay was validated for rapid  molecular differentiation of the Edwardsiella spp. affecting fish. Moreover, the  limitations of relying on partial 16S rRNA for discrimination of Edwardsiella  spp. and advantages of employing alternative single-copy genes gyrB and sodB for  molecular identification and classification of Edwardsiella were demonstrated.

GST  activity toward 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB) was also observed in the  liver, yet it was relatively low as opposed to the other substrates tested. On  the other hand, hepatic malondialdehyde level did not show any significant  alteration except after the exposure on day 15. The exposure of low  concentrations of diazinon to C. carpio can induce oxidative stress in liver; yet  restoring susceptibility and adapting to oxidative stress are likely to occur  when low level of oxidative stress is administered. Furthermore, no significant  change was observed in hepatic lipid peroxidation after diazinon treatment  indicating that liver tissue resisted to oxidative stress by enhancing their  antioxidant mechanisms. The level of lipid peroxidation was assumed to be  associated with the concentrations of diazinon and experimentation periods. The  induction of glutathione S-transferase and antioxidant enzyme activities were  also assumed to have resulted from the defense against the toxicity of diazinon.",2011-11,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,571-578,,6,26,,Environ Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 20196151,,,,Animals; Insecticides/*toxicity; Glutathione Transferase/metabolism; Catalase/metabolism; Oxidative Stress/drug effects; Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism; Antioxidants/metabolism; Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism; Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects; Malondialdehyde/metabolism; Carps/*physiology; Glutathione/metabolism; Diazinon/*toxicity; Liver/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies reported several  histopathological changes, enzymatic antioxidant modulation and immunity  disturbance in fish exposed to this pesticide. The objective of this work was to  investigate the direct effects of long-term exposure to environmental  concentrations of pendimethalin over a period of 18 months in rainbow trout  (Oncorhynchus mykiss) genitors. To do so, an experimental system consisting of  eight similar 400 L tanks with a flow-through of fresh river water was used to  perform daily chemical contamination. Fish were exposed to 850 ng/L for one hour  and the pendimethalin concentration was then gradually diluted during the day to  maintain optimal conditions for the fish throughout the experiment and to achieve  a mean theoretical exposure level of around 100 ng L(-1) per day. Every November,  males and females were stripped to collect eggs and sperm and two new first  generations of offspring were obtained. Kinetic sampling revealed differences in  immune system parameters and antioxidative defences in the contaminated trout  compared to the controls, due to pesticide exposure combined with seasonal  changes related to gamete maturation. Moreover, reproductive capacity was  significantly affected by exposure to the herbicide; a time lag of more than five  weeks was observed for egg maturation in contaminated females and high  bioconcentrations of pendimethalin were measured in eggs and sperm. Chemical  transfer from genitors to offspring via gametes may affect embryo development and  negatively impact the early stages of development.",2018-09,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,207-215,,,202,,Aquat Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2018.

Zinc pyrithione is an organometallic biocide, with bactericidal, algicidal and  fungicidal activities. It has been recently incorporated in antifouling formulas,  such as paints, which prevent the establishment of a biofilm on surfaces exposed  to the aquatic environment. It has also been used in cosmetics, such as  anti-dandruff shampoos and soaps. Previously reported data has shown the presence  of this substance in the aquatic compartment, a factor contributing to the  potential exertion of toxic effects, and there is also evidence that  photodegradation products of zinc pyrithione were involved in neurotoxic effects,  namely by inhibiting cholinesterases in fish species. Additional evidence points  to the involvement of zinc pyrithione in alterations of metal homeostasis and  oxidative stress, in both aquatic organisms and human cell models. The present  work assesses the potential ecotoxicity elicited by zinc pyrithione in the  freshwater fish Gambusia holbrooki after an acute (96 h) exposure. The oxidative  stress was assessed by the quantification of the activities of specific enzymes  from the antioxidant defense system, such as catalase, and  glutathione-S-transferases; and the extent of peroxidative damage was quantified  by measuring the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels. Neurotoxicity  was assessed through measurement of acetylcholinesterase activity; and a  standardized method for the description and assessment of histological changes in  liver and gills of was also used. Zinc pyrithione caused non-specific and  reversible tissue alterations, both in liver and gills of exposed organisms.  However, histopathological indices were not significantly different from the  control group. In terms of oxidative stress biomarkers, none of the tested  biomarkers indicated the occurrence of pro-oxidative effects, suggesting that the  oxidative pathway is not the major toxicological outcome of exposure to zinc  pyrithione.",2015-11,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,1896-1905,,9,24,,Ecotoxicology,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 26298705,,,,"Male; Animals; Biomarkers; Female; Oxidative stress; Biomarkers/metabolism; Oxidative Stress/drug effects; Antioxidants/metabolism; Neurotoxicity; Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity; Cyprinodontiformes/*metabolism; Antifouling; Histological damage; Mosquitofish; Organometallic Compounds/*toxicity; Organometallics; Pyridines/*toxicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

R.; Balcomb, R.",An ecological risk assessment for the use of Irgarol 1051 as an algaecide for antifoulant paints.,Critical reviews in toxicology,,1040-8444,,,"Irgarol 1051 is an algaecide used in copper-based antifoulant paints for controlling fouling organisms on the hulls of recreational and commercial  watercraft. Paints containing this algaecide have been used in Europe since the  mid-1980s. In 1998, the first antifouling paints containing Irgarol 1051 were  registered for use in the U. S. To examine the risk that Irgarol may pose to  aquatic ecosystems, a probabilistic ecological risk assessment was conducted  using distributions of exposure and toxicity data. Exposure data for this  assessment were derived from 11 monitoring studies (146 stations) conducted in  marinas, estuaries, and coastal waters from 1992 to 1997 in six European  countries. A comparison of 90th percentile concentrations pooled by station types  across all regions showed that concentrations in marinas (316 ng/l) were higher  than in estuaries and coastal waters (41 and 19 ng/l, respectively). A 90th  percentile of 133 ng/l was reported for all pooled stations. Temporal trends  showed that Irgarol concentrations typically peaked in early summer after  launching of small boats with much lower concentrations occurring during the  spring, fall, and winter. Toxicity data used for this risk assessment were  derived primarily from unpublished studies submitted to regulatory agencies.  Because Irgarol is a photosynthesis-inhibiting herbicide, it is much more toxic  to plants than animals. Toxicity values for animals (fish and invertebrates) were  much greater than concentrations of Irgarol reported in the environment.  Therefore, a conservative approach using a distribution of only plant toxicity  data (EC50s for plant growth) was used to derive a 10th percentile of 136 ng/l.  This plant toxicity benchmark of 136 ng/l was used for risk characterization.  Results from probabilistic analysis showed that ecological risk from Irgarol  exposure was low in estuaries, coastal areas, and various open-type marinas.  However, 10% or more of the plant species in enclosed marinas with low flushing  rates may be exposed to Irgarol concentrations that would reduce photosynthesis  activity and growth during the summer. Ecological risk to these sensitive plant  species in enclosed marinas will likely be moderated because of the reversibility  of Irgarol's inhibition of photosynthesis and the rapid recovery potential of  plant communities. The ecological significance of marinas that generally contain  numerous stressors such as trace metals, tributyltin, petroleum hydrocarbons,  high nutrient concentrations, and low dissolved oxygen concentrations is a  management issue that needs to be addressed.",1999-07,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,367-437,,4,29,,Crit Rev Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 10451264,,,,"Risk Assessment/methods; Water Pollutants/*toxicity; Models, Biological; Herbicides/chemistry/*toxicity; *Ecology; Biomass; Eukaryota/*drug effects; Paint/analysis/*toxicity; Ships; Triazines/chemistry/*toxicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mating behaviors are hormonally regulated and may be sexually selected traits:  courtship displays are selected via mate choice, while forced copulations and  aggressive behaviors are selected for via intrasexual competition. Endocrine  disrupting compounds interfere with proper hormonal functioning in exposed  animals. Exposures during developmentally crucial life stages can have  irreversible effects lasting through adulthood. I tested the effects of prenatal  exposure to environmentally relevant doses of a commonly used herbicide, atrazine  (1 and 13.5μg/L) on mating behaviors in male guppies. Guppies were used as a  model organism to test the effects of atrazine exposure on wildlife reproductive  health. Adult female guppies were mated and exposed to the treatments throughout  the gestation period, and offspring born to them were raised without further  treatment. At adulthood, the males were tested for the effects of prenatal  exposure on their mating behaviors such as courtship displays, gonopodium swings,  forced copulatory attempts, and competitive and aggressive behaviors towards  rivals who were not exposed to atrazine. I also tested female preference for  treated males compared to control males. Atrazine-exposed males were less likely  to perform the mating behaviors, and performed them less frequently, than control  males. Atrazine exposure also made males less aggressive towards rivals. Females  preferred untreated males over atrazine-treated males.

The three following experimental groups (n = 10 each) were  set: ""control"", quails exposed to drinking water, without ABA, ""EC1x"" and  ""EC1000x"" (0.31 mg a.i./L and 310.0 a.i./L, respectively; via commercial  formulation Kraft® 36EC). The open field test showed anxiolytic response in birds  exposed to ABA. These birds did not show locomotor changes or aggressive behavior  in the aggressiveness test. Quails exposed to the pesticide did not react to the  introduction of an object in the experimental box during the object recognition  test, and it suggested perception deficit due to ABA. Moreover, these birds did  not recognize the cat (Felix catus) and the vocalization of a hawk (Rupornis  magnirostris) as potential predatory threats. These responses also suggest  anti-predatory behavior deficit due to the pesticide.

Widespread use of  chemicals in such a broad sphere raises important concerns not only about safety  for the users, consumers and target species, but especially about the not so  obvious effects upon the ecosystems in which they are used. Some undetermined  level of biological diversity is necessary to maintain ecological function and  resilience. These, in turn, are necessary for generating the biological resources  (trees, fish, wildlife, crops) and ecological services (watershed protection, air  cleansing, climate stabilisation, erosion control) on which economic activity and  human welfare depend. The driving forces behind decline of biodiversity stem  entirely from human activities. Underlying causes are those resulting from the  cultural and social factors associated with economic activities and lead to  direct depletion of species, and degradation or destruction of habitats. The  broad spectrum and high efficacy of the macrocyclic lactones against nematode and  arthropod parasites of livestock and companion animals are unprecedented. Cattle,  horses, sheep, swine, dogs--to varying degrees all are utilised by humans for  economic gain. Detrimental impact upon non-target animals is considered  acceptable in eradicating parasites because of their economic importance to  commercial livestock production. Production will increase when these parasites  are eliminated, but we remain oblivious to the long-term consequences of our  actions. What are the ecological limits to rural economic activities? Decomposing  animal faeces help to maintain our ecosystem by returning valuable nutrients to  the soil. Dung fauna-fungi, yeast, bacteria, nematodes, insects and  earthworms--play a non-conspicuous but important and varied role in this  decomposition process, a role dependent upon many factors, especially  environmental ones. Anthelmintics and pesticides are of considerable value in  agriculture, but largely at an unevaluated cost to the greater environment. We  have insufficient knowledge of the extent to which a spectrum of anthelmintics  and pesticides affect ecological function and ecosystem resilience in our  commercial plant and animal production systems. It is time we developed a genuine  interest in avoiding ""the dialogue of the deal"" that in the past has minimised  interdisciplinary research between environmental ecology and commercial plant and  animal production.",1997-02,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,173-180,,2,27,,Int J Parasitol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 9088988,,,,"Humans; Animals; Pesticides/*toxicity; *Ecosystem; *Parasitic Diseases, Animal; Anthelmintics/therapeutic use/*toxicity; Parasitic Diseases/drug therapy/prevention & control",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus,  effective and safe prevention and control of this bacterium are urgently needed  to combat the related infections. Live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) effectively  prevent infectious diseases. However, most of the existing E. piscicida LAVs are  based on the deletion of genes encoding the translocon components of the type III  secretion system (T3SS), the core virulence system, which is the most prominent  protective bacterial antigen with the strongest immunogenicity.

Ubiquitous, persistent, and substantial uses of  Harness(®) in agricultural processes have resulted in the pollution of nearby  water sources, posing a threat to various aquatic biotas, including fish. The  effects of Harness(®) toxicity on fish health are little known. So, this study  aimed to describe the impact of herbicide Harness(®) on the oxidative stress and  reproductive and thyroid performance of male and female tilapia (Oreochromis  niloticus) and also investigate the prospective role of the natural antioxidant  lycopene supplementation in dismissing the adverse properties of Harness(®).  Antioxidant enzyme (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and total antioxidant  capacity) and hormone measurements (T, E2, T3, and T4) were carried out, and  gonadal and thyroid follicle histological sections were examined as a method to  investigate the effects of Harness(®) toxicity on fish. Male and female tilapia  were exposed to 10 μmol/L and 100 μmol/L of Harness(®) and treated with 10 mg  lycopene/kg for 15 days of exposure. Our results demonstrated that the  antioxidant enzyme activity was altered by Harness exposure and serum T for both  males and females dropped; also, female E2 levels decreased, but male E2  increased. Exposure to higher dose of Harness(®) induced elevation in both T3 and  T4 levels, although the low exposure dose stimulated T4 levels. Harness(®)  exposure prompted histological variations and degenerative changes in testicular,  ovarian, and thyroid follicle tissues. Lycopene supplement administration  diminished oxidative stress induced by Harness(®), alleviating its endocrine  disparaging effects by neutralizing T3, T4, T, and E2 and ameliorating the  histological structure of gonadal and thyroid tissues. In conclusion, lycopene  supplementation was preformed to normalize the alterations and oxidative damage  caused by Harness(®) in Nile tilapia, suggesting that lycopene-supplemented diet  functioned as potent antioxidants and had the ability to alleviate oxidative  stress and thyroid and reproductive toxicity caused by herbicide Harness(®).

The nonimprinted membranes (NIMs)  were also synthesized using the same procedure without the template. Meanwhile,  AFM, XPS, ATR-FTIR, contact angle, and permselectivity experiments were conducted  to elucidate the imprinting and recognition properties of MIMs. Results  demonstrated that MIMs exhibited excellent imprinting effect and high  permselectivity. A molecularly imprinted-membrane-assisted solvent extraction  (MI-MASE) method based on the MIMs was established. The operating conditions were  optimized for group-selective extraction of the five pyrethroid insecticides.  Compared with NIMs, higher extraction recoveries (83.8% to 100.6%) of the five  pyrethroid insecticides by gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD)  were obtained using MIMs at three spiked levels in fish samples; the RSD values  were lower than 8.3%. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ)  defined as the concentrations at which the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is 3:1 and  10:1, respectively, were in the range of 0.26 to 0.42 μg/kg and 0.77 to 1.27  μg/kg, respectively.

The ability of ABZ to act as mitotic  spindle poison leads to a potential risk for aneuploidy induction in exposed  human beings. ABZ, as well as albendazole sulphoxide (ABZSO), its main  metabolite, induce micronuclei in human cells in a dose-dependent manner. Despite  recognition that ABZ and ABZSO increase micronucleus frequency, their potential  as inducers of non-disjunction in human cells, an event considered more frequent  than chromosome loss, and one of the main mechanisms involved in aneuploidy  induction, has not been evaluated. In the present work, we investigated the  ability of ABZ and ABZSO to induce non-disjunction in cultured human lymphocytes.  Non-disjunction was scored by chromosome-specific FISH using a classical or alpha  satellite probe for chromosomes 1 and 7, respectively. Significant increase in  non-disjunction events that involved either chromosome were observed in cells  treated with ABZ or ABZSO.

However, fish responses to  organophosphates may vary depending on the activation of different defense  mechanisms as well as the length of exposure. As such, the evaluation of  acetylcholinesterase activity, in combination with the evaluation of  biotransformation and antioxidants enzymes levels, is useful for indicating  damage in fish exposed to this insecticide. Moreover, evaluating mitochondrial  activity might evidence how the hierarchic responses occur in relation to the  length of time that the fish is exposed. Therefore, the aim of our study is to  evaluate whether the length of exposure to malathion differentially affects the  biochemical responses of tambaqui. Our hypothesis is that the physiological  alterations due to exposure are time dependent. Fish were exposed to sublethal  concentrations of the insecticide during 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Contrary to  expectations, there was no acetylcholinesterase activity inhibition during the  experiment, which indicates an absence of neurotoxicity. Phase II  biotransformation mechanism was activated early, especially in the liver.  Oxidative damage was evident in the first hours of exposure and was concurrent  with the activation of antioxidant enzymes. Mitochondrial bioenergetics were  differentially affected by the length of exposure.

The objective of the study was to determine the toxic effects of  atrazine at an environmentally relevant concentration of atrazine, 0.3 μg.L-1 and  at concentrations of 30, 100, and 300 μg.L-1 on morphometric and condition  characteristics, development of early life stages, and antioxidant defense  enzymes of common carp. METHODS: The embryo-larval toxicity test was performed  according to the OECD Guidelines 210 (Fish, Early-life Stage Toxicity Test).  RESULTS: Atrazine exposure showed no effect on morphometric and condition  characteristics or histology. Exposure at 0.3 μg.L-1 was associated with  significantly increased activity of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione  S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase compared to control. Activity  of glutathione reductase was slightly higher at a concentration of 0.3 μg.L-1,  with significantly lower (p<0.05) activity observed in groups exposed to 30, 100,  and 300 μg.L-1 compared to the group exposed to 0.3 μg.L-1.

METHODS: The research was based on retrieval and critical review of  relevant articles and abstracts cited in international and regional journals. The  literature search was done on MedLine from the year 1975 to 2010. The analyses of  published data on various vertebrates (birds, fish, mice, human, among others)  were considered. RESULTS: The effect of DDT on body functions is purely dependent  on the degree of exposure. Whereas mild exposure (1-5mg/kg) may not have  significant effects, very high concentrations (>100mg/kg) of DDT generally  adversely affect the reproductive functions of animals. Eggshell quality, egg  hatch-ability and health of chicks are affected by high DDT exposure. Very high  DDT levels may increase the chances of spontaneous abortion and preterm birth,  which is one of the main causes of infant mortality in humans. The health of a  growing foetus and infant may also be compromised by DDT transfer from an exposed  mother through the placenta and breast milk. The DDT affects the estrous cycle of  exposed animals by altering the hormonal functions. In male rats, DDT has been  observed to alter spermatogenesis and reduce aggression behaviour. However the  effect in higher male animals has not been clearly elucidated. CONCLUSION: DDT  exposure has drastic effects on reproductive functions in vertebrates, and safer  alternatives should be considered rather than re-introducing DDT as a control  agent for mosquitoes as has been suggested recently.",2011-12,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,271-274,,4,8,,East Afr J Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Tanzania PMID: 23120935,,,,Humans; Male; Animals; Female; Infant; Pregnancy; Rats; Mice; Environmental Pollutants/*adverse effects; Insecticides/*adverse effects; Reproduction/*drug effects; *Vertebrates/physiology; DDT/*pharmacology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although triazole fungicides are widely found in  the aquatic environment, little is known about their acute toxicity on fish. In  this study we assessed the effects of short-term exposure to Topas on some  parameters of homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as the levels of  markers of oxidative stress and parameters of the antioxidant defense system of  goldfish (Carassius auratus L.). Gills appeared to be the main target organ of  Topas toxicity, showing the greatest number of parameters affected. Gills of  Topas-treated fish showed a higher content of low (L-SH) and high (H-SH)  molecular mass thiols and higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD),  catalase, glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) as well as reduced carbonyl protein  content (CP), as compared with those in the control group. In the liver, goldfish  exposure to 15-25mgL(-1) Topas resulted in a higher L-SH and H-SH content, but  lower CP levels and activity of GST. In kidney, Topas exposure resulted in higher  activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and G6PDH, but lower L-SH content and  activity of GST. The results of this study indicate that acute goldfish exposure  to the triazole fungicide Topas increased efficiency of the antioxidant system in  fish gills, liver, and kidney. This could indicate the development of low  intensity oxidative stress which up-regulates defense mechanisms responsible for  protection of goldfish against deleterious ROS effects.",2017-03,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,01-Aug,,,193,,Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2016.

Enzymes that constitute the first line antioxidant defence, namely SOD and CAT,  GSH-related enzymes, GR and GST, together with AChE activities were also  determined spectrophotometrically. Fenthion did not cause any alteration in SOD  and CAT activities while increasing GSH content, GSH/GSSG ratio and GST specific  enzyme activity and decreasing GSSG, TBARS, and protein contents.

Since 1974, the Herring Gull has been widely  used in the Great Lakes as a spatial and temporal monitor of organochlorine (OC)  contaminant levels and associated biological effects. Most eggs contained a wide  range of OCs, the main compounds being DDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),  dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide, oxychlordane, hexachlorobenzene and mirex. Levels  of an additional ten OCs and five polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD)  congeners were also determined for some sites. Overall, levels varied  significantly among colonies, but there was no obvious relationship to spatial  distribution of contaminants in sediments or fish species. OC levels in eggs had  declined by up to 84% since 1974. Eggshells were only 8% thinner than before the  introduction of DDT, and shell thinning was not a cause of breeding failure.  Average reproductive output varied from 0.15 to 1.57 young per apparently  occupied nest in 1983: at 56% of colonies the value was below that thought  necessary to maintain stable populations. The main causes of failure were egg  disappearence and cannibalism of chicks. Despite this, the population appeared to  have been increasing at about 4% per annum. Reduced availability of forage fish  during the early 1980s was the most likely reason for the poor reproductive  output in 1983.",1994-02,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,229-251,,3,29,,Environ Monit Assess,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Netherlands PMID: 24221346,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A synthetic pyrethroid, cypermethrin, is licensed for use on fish  farms to control sea lice infestations as a formulation called Excis. In this  study, uptake of cypermethrin from Excis exposure is investigated through the use  of gas chromatography with mass-spectrometry. The effects of Excis on mussels are  also examined by measuring the neutral red retention time of lysosomes, aerial  survival and shell closure. The isomeric ratios of cis:trans cypermethrin  measured in mussels are around 80:20; a marked increase from 40:60 to which the  mussels were exposed. This is most likely due to preferential metabolism of  trans-isomers, as the same response is seen in vertebrates. There is a pronounced  behavioural effect of shell closure, where mussels exposed to 1000 microg/l  cypermethrin shut their shells within an hour of exposure. Arguments are  presented for this effect being either a voluntary response on recognition of  cypermethrin, or an effect arising from an involuntary action of cypermethrin on  the adductor muscle. Even at 1000 microg/l cypermethrin, neutral red retention  time and aerial survival are not affected.

Here, we show that the expression of  ornaments in the viviparous amarillo fish (Girardinichthys multiradiatus) is  influenced by embryonic exposure to low concentrations of an organophosphorus  insecticide. Male ornamental fin size, dimorphic yellow coloration and display  rates were all compromised in exposed fish, but unaffected in their paternal  half-sibling controls and in their sisters (morphology and colour). Exposure  resulted in smaller fish of both sexes, thus the differential effect by sex was  restricted to attributes such as fin size only above the naturally selected  magnitude shown by females. Father phenotype predicted offspring morphology of  controls, but not of exposed males, which were discriminated against by both  control and exposed females.

Investigations in frogs  suggested that early life exposure to a pesticide resulted in higher tolerance to  a subsequent challenge. This led to the hypothesis that early-life stage  exposures can alter phenotypically plastic traits during development, resulting  in induced tolerance. Here, we used Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) to test the  role of detoxification pathway priming in this inducible tolerance. In frogs, the  induced tolerance is present five days after the end of the pre-exposure, but  absent after a month. We show that a pre-exposure early in life with carbaryl,  induces the activity of cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) and increases the ability of  pre-exposed groups to metabolize carbaryl, likely because of activation of the  aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. Embryos pre-exposed to carbaryl had a  350-500% increase in CYP1A activity, threefold greater capacity to metabolize  carbaryl and were more tolerant to a lethal challenge five days after the end of  pre-exposure. However, ten days later the differences in CYP1A activity,  metabolic capacity and tolerance between pre-exposed and control groups were no  longer present. Thus, we conclude that the increase in tolerance observed in  pre-exposed fish embryos was due to the activation of the AHR and other metabolic  pathways, resulting in a prolonged increase in biotransformation capacity. This  allowed individuals to more efficiently deal with subsequent chemical challenges  for a short period after the initial pre-exposure. However, this induced  tolerance was only short-lived due to the recycling of biotransformation enzymes  in the cells as part of general cellular protein maintenance. These findings  suggest that induced tolerance was likely due to induction of defense mechanisms  during the duration of response to the original stressor, rather than a more  permanent change in their ability to respond to future challenges.",2017-05,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,615-621,,,224,,Environ Pollut,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of PCZ (0.2, 50, and 500 microg/l)  for 7, 20, and 30 days, respectively. Oxidative stress indices (reactive oxygen  species, lipid peroxidation, and carbonyl protein) and antioxidant parameters  (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase,  and reduced glutathione) were measured, as well as Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity.  Adaptive responses to PCZ-induced stress were observed at 7 days. With prolonged  exposure, significantly higher levels of oxidative indices were indicative of  oxidative stress, as also were the significant inhibition of antioxidant enzyme  activity and reduced glutathione content. Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was  significantly inhibited after prolonged exposure. Chemometrics of all parameters  by principal component analysis, enabled the separation of sampled individuals  into four groups with 93.39% of total accumulated variance. A low level of  oxidative stress can induce the adaptive responses of the antioxidant defense  system, while prolonged exposure to PCZ may lead to serious oxidative damage in  fish brain.

Fish are an integral part of the  aquatic environment and are, therefore, suitable models for the study of the  behavioral, biological, and biochemical effects of triazine exposure. We have  summarized and evaluated the effects of triazine herbicides on fish in order to  provide an overview of current information on triazines. The overall effects of  triazine herbicide exposure on the physiology of fish were evaluated by  considering a variety of parameters in a number of reports. Haematological and  biochemical profiles of blood provide important information about the internal  environment of the organism and the general physiology and health status of  triazine exposed fish. According to studies using biotransformation and  bioaccumulation indices to estimate the effects of triazines on fish, changes in  fish metabolism reflect the pollution of the environment by these herbicides. The  responses of antioxidant defence systems in fish to triazine exposure could be an  adaptive mechanism to protect the fish from triazine-induced oxidative stress.  Acute exposure to triazines affects reproduction or reproductive development in  fish; however, some triazines did not affect fish behavior during long-term  exposure to low concentrations.

The chemical concentration data were combined with the pattern of consumption of  these foodstuffs in order to calculate the daily intake of these contaminants,  and on this basis the risk quotients for carcinogenicity and acute toxicity were  determined for Spanish adults and children. Our results showed that the daily  intake of OCPs, PCBs and B[a]Peq, which is associated to blue fish consumption  was the highest within the fish group. The estimated intake of pollutants can be  considered low or very low for the individual contaminants, when compared to  reference values, except in the case of HCB and As. All the estimated intakes  were below the reported Tolerable Daily Intakes. Considering the additive effects  of multiple contaminants, the risk of acute toxic effects can also be considered  as low or very low. However, our results reflect that the current consumption of  white fish in adults and children, and also the blue fish in the case of adults,  poses a moderate carcinogenic risk to Spanish consumers, mainly related to their  concentrations of As.

We previously demonstrated that miR-155 was significantly  downregulated in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in response to fipronil  (5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl)  sulphinyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile) exposure. However, the regulation of this  miRNA's predicted target gene cyb561d2, which is a member of the cytochrome b561  (cyt b561) family involved in electron transfer, cell defence, and chemical  stress, has not been experimentally validated to date. In this study, we  evaluated the effects of fipronil on miR-155 and cyb561d2 in zebrafish. The  expression of miR-155 was downregulated, whereas cyb561d2 was upregulated in both  mRNA and protein level in a dose-dependent manner upon stimulation of fipronil.  The dual luciferase report assay demonstrated that miR-155 interacted with  cyb561d2 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR). The expression of cyb561d2 was reduced  in both mRNA and protein levels when ZF4 cells were transfected with an miR-155  mimic, whereas its expression levels of both mRNA and protein were increased when  endogenous miR-155 was inhibited by transfection with an miR-155 inhibitor.

It is attributed to many factors  including exposure to agropesticides such as manganese ethylenebis  (dithiocarbamate) (maneb), which is one of the most frequently used fungicides in  Cameroon. Previous reports support efficiency of some medicinal plants commonly  used in Cameroonian folk medicine for the treatment of this disorder. OBJECTIVE:  The present study was aimed at assessing the protective effect of extracts from  selected plant species, namely Basella alba L. (Basellaceae) (MEBa) and  Carpolobia alba G. Don (Polygalaceae) (AECa), in alleviating the maneb-induced  impairment of male reproductive function in Wistar albino rats. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: The rats were treated with vehicle, plant extract (MEBa or AECa), maneb  and maneb plus plant extract, respectively, and their fertility was assessed.  Animals were thereafter sacrificed and organs (liver, kidneys and reproductive  organs) were dissected out and weighed. Serum androgens together with alanine  aminotransferase, liver glutathione and thiobarbituric acid reactive species  (TBARS) were also measured. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From this study, both plant  extracts stimulated testosterone and improved fertility. Administration of MEBa  plus maneb prevented fertility reduction by maneb and minimized the inhibitory  effect of maneb on testosterone levels. AECa also improved fertility of the  maneb-exposed rats, though without restoring testosterone levels, and other  investigated parameters remained unaffected by different treatments. CONCLUSION:  These findings emphasized the beneficial effects of B. alba and C. alba extracts  on male fertility, and suggest their protective effect against maneb-induced  toxicity in male reproductive function.",2014-01,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,97-104,,1,52,,Pharm Biol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 24073857,,,,"Male; Animals; Rats; Disease Models, Animal; Fungicides, Industrial/toxicity; Cameroon; Infertility, Male/*prevention & control; Magnoliopsida/*chemistry; Maneb/toxicity; Medicine, Traditional; Plant Extracts/*pharmacology; Polygalaceae/*chemistry; Rats, Wistar; Testosterone/blood",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the current study was undertaken to highlight the effects of  penoxsulam exposure on O. niloticus and to evaluate the advantages of Chlorella  vulgaris (CV) dietary supplementation against the induced effects. The 96-h  lethal concentration 50 (LC(50)) penoxsulam value for O. niloticus was estimated  at 8.948 mg/L by probit analysis in a static bioassay experiment. Next, 360  healthy fish were randomly allocated into 6 treatment groups. The T1 group served  as the negative control and was fed a basal diet. The T2 group served as the  positive control and was fed a basal diet supplemented with 10% CV. The fish in  the T3 and T4 groups were exposed to 1/10 the 96-h LC(50) of penoxsulam  (0.8948 mg/L) and were fed the basal diet alone or the basal diet supplemented  with 10% CV, respectively. The fish in the T5 and T6 groups were exposed to 1/5  the 96-h LC(50) of penoxsulam (1.7896 mg/L) and fed the basal diet alone or the  basal diet supplemented with 10% CV, respectively. Sub-acute penoxsulam exposure  significantly altered hematological indices, as well as compromised the fish's  immune defense mechanisms, including the phagocytic percentage, phagocytic index,  nitric oxide production, immunoglobulin M levels and lysozyme, anti-trypsin and  bactericidal activities subsequently decreasing O. niloticus's resistance to the  Aeromonus sobria challenge and increasing disease symptoms and the mortality  rate. Furthermore, sub-chronic penoxsulam exposure markedly altered growth  performance, oxidant/antioxidant status and liver status and down-regulated the  expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis-α (TNF-α). Interestingly,  incorporating 10% CV into the diet protects fish against sub-acute  penoxsulam-induced immunotoxicity via improvement of immune responses that  increases the resistance against bacterial infection. Further, it improved the  growth performance, oxidant/antioxidant status, liver status and markedly  up-regulated immune-related gene expression, IL-1β and TNF-α, in the spleens of  fish sub-chronically exposed to penoxsulam.

The potential for OPFRs to cause  adverse health effects of their own is still unexamined. Because of their  structural similarities to organophosphate pesticides, which have themselves been  heavily researched and shown to be neurobehavioral teratogens, we investigated  the possibility that developmental exposure to two OPFRs, triphenyl phosphate  (TPHP), and tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl)phosphate (TDCIPP) might lead to  behavioral impairment across the lifespan, as has been observed with the  organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos. METHODS: Zebrafish were exposed to 0.03  or 0.3 μM of TPHP, TDCIPP, or chlorpyrifos from 0 to 5 days post fertilization.  Vehicle control consisted of 0.03% solution of DMSO. At 6 days post  fertilization, larvae were tested on a locomotor assay. Separate cohorts of 6 day  old larvae that were not tested on the larval assay were allowed to grow to  adulthood. At 12 weeks post fertilization, these adult zebrafish were tested on a  battery of behavioral assays that included tests of novel environment  exploration, startle habituation, social affiliation, and predator escape.  RESULTS: Developmental exposure altered zebrafish behavior across the lifespan.  Larval zebrafish exposed to the 0.03 μM doses of chlorpyrifos or TDCIPP exhibited  significant (p<0.05) hyperactivity in the locomotor assay. Organophosphate  exposure significantly (p<0.05) altered the time course of adult zebrafish  behavior in the novel environment, startle habituation, and social affiliation  assays. Predator escape behavior was significantly (p<0.05) reduced in fish  exposed to the 0.3 μM dose of TDCIPP. Exposure also caused hyperactivity in adult  fish, with fish exposed to the 0.3 μM dose of TDCIPP exhibiting significantly  (p<0.05) elevated locomotor behavior in the novel environment assay. DISCUSSION:  Early developmental exposure to OPFRs produced behavioral impairment that  persisted into adulthood.

For a period of 30 days, groups of adult male  guppies were exposed to vinclozolin, p,p'-DDE, or the therapeutic antiandrogen  flutamide (used as positive control) applied to the fodder at concentrations  between 0.1 and 100 microg/g fodder. Subsequently, sexual characteristics of  relevance to the male reproductive capacity were measured and compared with  untreated control fish. All three chemicals caused profound alterations at  increasing levels of biological organization, even in these fully matured males.  At the cellular level, the three compounds induced a significant reduction in the  number of ejaculated sperm cells. At the organ level, the sexually attractive  orange-yellow coloration was reduced in area and discolored, and treated fish  also had smaller testes. Further, at the organismal level, computer-aided  behavior analyses demonstrated a severe disruption in male courtship behavior.

DESIGN: The toxicity tests were performed on common carp according to OECD 203  methodologies. The common carp were exposed to Fury 10 EW at concentrations, 5,  7, 10, 50 and 100 μg.l-1 for 96 h and compared to common carp in a non-treated  control group. Acute toxicity tests were detected value 96hLC50=13.8 µg.l-1. On  the basis of the results was assessed the effect on the hematological profile,  oxidative stress parameters, and antioxidants biomarkers in tissues, in another  acute test. RESULTS: The observed 96hLC50 value of Fury 10 EW was 13.8 μg.l-1. A  significantly lower large lymphocyte and monocyte count, and a significantly  greater number of segmented eosinophil granulocyte and higher hematocrit was  found in the pesticide-exposed common carp compared to controls.

The rate of pest adaptation is influenced by the type of control,  the selective pressure it imposes, and the gene flow between farms. By  understanding how these factors influence evolution at the metapopulation level,  pest management strategies that prevent resistance from evolving can be  developed. We developed a model for the metapopulation and evolutionary dynamics  of the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), which is a major parasite  affecting salmon aquaculture. Different management scenarios were simulated  across a network of salmon farms covering half of Norway, and their effects on  louse epidemiology and evolution were investigated. We compared louse controls  that differed in how they were deployed through time (discrete vs. continuous),  how they impacted the louse life cycle, and in their overall efficacy. We  adjusted the strength of selection imposed by treatments, the dominance effect of  the resistant allele, and the geographic location at which resistance originated.  Continuously acting strategies (e.g., louse-resistant salmon) were generally more  effective than discrete strategies at controlling lice, especially when they  increased louse mortality during early developmental stages. However, effective  strategies also risked imposing frequent and/or strong selection on lice, thus  driving rapid adaptation. Resistant alleles were more likely to be lost through  genetic drift when they were recessive, had a low-fitness advantage, or  originated in low-farm-density areas. The north-flowing current along the  Norwegian coastline dispersed resistant genes from south to north, and limited  gene flow in the opposite direction. We demonstrate how evolutionary models can  produce quantitative predictions over large spatial and temporal scales and for a  range of pest control scenarios. Quantitative outputs can be translated into  practical management decisions applied at a regional level to minimise the risk  of resistance developing.",2023-12,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,1982-1998,,12,16,,Evol Appl,,,,,,,,eng,© 2023 The Authors.

METHODS: Both low malarious (DDT spray from 1958 to 1976) and high malarious (DDT  spray from 1958 to April 2006) villages were selected for the study in Arid zone  district Jodhpur, Rajasthan during March-April 2006. Resting behaviour of the  species during all its movement rhythms covering 24 h period related to: (i)  swarming/ mating; (ii) pre- and post-biting rest; (iii) after feed resting  between hoping movements; (iv) night and day time resting and; (v) diel activity  movements in response to temperature changes, were carried out. RESULTS: The  results showed that household objects like cupboards, furnitures, hanging  clothes, goods stacked on loft, stored clothes, cobwebs and floor were the  dominant resting sites both in sprayed and unsprayed villages. About 95 and 97%  of An. stephensi preferred to rest on household objects of unsprayed and sprayed  villages respectively. There was no significant difference in resting behaviour  of the species in both groups of villages (p >0.05). The pre-biting resting time  was recorded as 5 to 15 min whereas post-biting resting time lasted for 15 to 25  min. After biting outdoor (in courtyard--open to sky) species starts entering the  rooms at around 2330 hrs. It was observed that during III quarter (0100 to 0400  hrs) maximum species entered into the room were 56% in unsprayed and 62% in  sprayed villages. Statistically there was no significant difference in the entry  of mosquitoes (p >0.05) in both the groups of villages. CONCLUSION: Before DDT  era, An. stephensi was found resting at all heights of the walls inside the human  dwellings. Present study revealed that An. stephensi is trying to avoid sprayable  surfaces and tend to rest on unsprayable surfaces during all its movement rhythms  starting from swarming, pre-/post-biting and during hopping movements in the  courtyard and thereafter household objects inside the room as final day time  resting. It was concluded that changed behaviour of resting of An. stephensi on  unsprayable objects in sprayed rooms largely accounted for failure of malaria  control. Control of An. stephensi, thus requires an integrated vector control  strategy based upon interesectoral, environmental, larviciding with  chemical/biolarvicide and use of larvivorous fish wherever feasible.

Biomarkers involved in xenobiotic-mediated responses were individually  contrasted in fish of both species and 17 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)  analysed in muscle to reveal bioaccumulation trends. The parameters were in  muscle: cholinesterases, metabolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and citrate  synthase (CS); and in liver: cytochrome P450 dependent activities (EROD and  BFCOD), carboxylesterase (CE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione  reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT). All markers are  considered adaptive defence mechanism to face stress. Sensitivity to a model  pesticide: dichlorvos was also contrasted in vitro in muscular  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and hepatic CE to reveal species sensitivity to  neurotoxic chemicals. Enzymatic activities related to protective mechanisms such  as butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), CE and CAT were higher in chub whereas the  antioxidant defences GR and GPX were higher in barbel. Aerobic CS was also higher  in barbel while anaerobic LDH was so in chub. EROD activity did not differ  between the two species but BFCOD activity was higher in barbel. Levels of PFAS  were higher in barbel likely due to its benthic habitat. The in vitro tests  revealed higher sensitivity to dichlorvos of muscular AChE in chub (lower IC50)  which was probably compensated by a higher catalytic efficiency of CE.

Carbofuran caused a significant (p<0.05)  increase in CRT and T3 levels; the mean levels of T4, TST, E2 exhibited  significant decreases (p<0.05) in carbofuran-treated fish. Toxicity of carbofuran  on liver, kidney, gills, gonads and muscles after 35 days of exposure was found.  Glycogen levels showed a highly significant decrease in liver and gills (p<  0.001), a significant decrease (p< 0.05) in kidney and muscles, and insignificant  changes (p>0.05) in gonads of treated fish. The two metabolic enzymes G6PDH and  LDH in all tissues exhibited significant decreases (p<0.05) in treated fish. SOD,  CAT, GSH and GST levels showed significant decreases (p<0.05) in all tissues of  fish after exposure to carbofuran. LPO levels increased significantly (p<0.05) in  all tissues except gonads after 5 weeks of exposure to carbofuran. There was a  significant (p<0.05) increase in DNA fragmentation percentage in treated fish.  Our results provide a clear evidence on the response of C. gariepinus to  sublethal doses of carbofuran and allow us to consider catfish as a good  bioindicator to reflect the endocrine disrupting impacts of carbofuran, and  reflect the potential of this pesticide to cause disturbance in antioxidant  defense system as well as metabolism and induction of lipid peroxidation (LPO)  and DNA damage in contaminated ecosystems.",2014-08,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,33-39,,,106,,Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In  particular, the paradigm for strong, directly density-dependent (DDD)  postsettlement mortality stands in contrast to recent evidence for inversely  density-dependent (IDD) mortality. We review the processes responsible for DDD  and IDD per capita mortality in reef fishes, noting that the pattern observed  depends on predator and prey behavior, the spatial configuration of the reef  habitat, and the spatial and temporal scales of observation. Specifically,  predators tend to produce DDD prey mortality at their characteristic spatial  scale of foraging, but prey mortality is IDD at smaller spatial scales due to  attack-abatement effects (e.g., risk dilution). As a result, DDD mortality may be  more common than IDD mortality on patch reefs, which tend to constrain predator  foraging to the same scale as prey aggregation, eliminating attack-abatement  effects. Additionally, adjacent groups of prey on continuous reefs may share a  subset of refuges, increasing per capita refuge availability and relaxing DDD  mortality relative to prey on patch reefs, where the patch edge could prevent  such refuge sharing. These hypotheses lead to a synthetic framework to predict  expected mortality patterns for a variety of scenarios. For nonsocial,  nonaggregating species and species that aggregate in order to take advantage of  spatially clumped refuges, IDD mortality is possible but likely superseded by DDD  refuge competition, especially on patch reefs. By contrast, for species that  aggregate socially, mortality should be IDD at the scale of individual  aggregations but DDD at larger scales. The results of nearly all prior reef fish  studies fit within this framework, although additional work is needed to test  many of the predicted outcomes. This synthesis reconciles some apparent  contradictions in the recent reef fish literature and suggests the importance of  accounting for the scale-sensitive details of predator and prey behavior in any  study system.",2010-07,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,1949-1961,,7,91,,Ecology,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 20715614,,,,"Animals; Fishes/*physiology; *Ecosystem; *Behavior, Animal; Anthozoa; Longevity; Population Density",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This suggests an  impairment in prey recognition of the exposed zebrafish. At a lower CHP  concentration (1 μg/l), no differences in feeding rate of zebrafish were  observed.

To investigate the  possible effects of exposure to EDCs on reproductive behavior in a wild  population of songbirds, we examined the effects of vinclozolin in wild-caught  Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis). For this and many other temperate songbird  species, testosterone has powerful activational effects on affiliative behaviors  in adulthood. We hypothesized that vinclozolin would affect male behaviors  associated with female preference. Male juncos received daily oral gavage for 10  weeks with 2mM vinclozolin in vehicle or vehicle alone. Juncos were  photostimulated (16L:8D) to induce breeding behavior. Each pair of a treated and  non-treated male was presented to an estrogen-primed female to assess female  preference. Seven of eight females exhibited a strong preference for a male  exposed to vinclozolin over a control male (p=0.01). The only significant  difference in measured male behaviors was increased beak wiping in controls  (p=0.006) and there was no difference in gonad size or brain weight (p>0.05 for  each). Our data suggest that estrogen-primed female juncos prefer to associate  with male juncos exposed to this anti-androgen.

Environmental pollutants, notably endocrine disrupting compounds,  can interfere with the proper functioning of hormones, thereby impacting the  expression of hormonally regulated traits. Atrazine, one of the most widely used  herbicides, can alter sex hormone levels in exposed animals. I tested the effects  of environmentally relevant atrazine exposures on mating signals and behaviors in  male guppies, a sexually dimorphic freshwater fish. Prolonged atrazine exposure  reduced the expression of two honest signals: the area of orange spots  (ornaments) and the number of courtship displays performed. Atrazine exposure  also reduced aggression towards competing males in the context of mate  competition. In the wild, exposure levels vary among individuals because of  differential distribution of the pollutants across habitats; hence, differently  impacted males often compete for the same mates. Disrupted mating signals can  reduce reproductive success as females avoid mating with perceptibly suboptimal  males. Less aggressive males are at a competitive disadvantage and lose access to  females.

The objective of the  present study was to evaluate the environmental factors that may have influenced  the development oh hypospadias in children treated at the Maternal and Child  University Hospital od Las Palmas of Gran Canaria Island during the years  2012-2015. METHODS: The present study represents a retrospective analysis of  patients treated for hypospadias in the Maternal-Paediatric University Hospital  of Las Palmas of Gran Canaria during 4 years (2012 -2015) by the use of medical  records and telephone survey to families' patients. To perform the statistical  analysis of the data, the SPSS program was used in version 15.0. The level of  statistical significance was established for an error α = 0.05.

This study examined morphological (length, weight, age), biochemical  (lipid content, δ(13)C, δ(15)N), population and OC data for 9 fishes and  zooplankton between 1993 and 2003 (2010 for lake trout) to investigate causes for  the OC declines. Growth dilution was a major factor influencing the decrease of  OCs in lake trout, round whitefish and possibly zooplankton most notably in the  early 2000s. A decline in lipids of most fish species also contributed to OC  declines, although no such change was evident for zooplankton. It is suspected  that increases in fish populations or climate variations over the 1990s, may have  contributed towards a shift in plankton community composition. From 1991 to 1999,  CPUE increased for 7 of the fish species and declined for 2 others. Concurrently,  the zooplankton community shifted from an abundance of C. scutifer in 1993 to  dominance by D. pribilofensis in 2001. Nitrogen and carbon stable isotope data  suggested that food web interactions for most fish species have not changed over  time. Although concentrations of OCs have declined in many fishes, the ""rate"" of  OC transfer (using slopes of log OC vs. nitrogen isotope ratios) through the food  web was greater in 2001 than in 1993. Overall, the declines in OC concentrations  in the fish from Lake Laberge occurred concurrently with changes in their growth,  lipid, and abundance, suggesting that ecosystem responses to the closure of the  fishery were in part responsible for the lower contaminants in these fishes. As a  result of this study, the Yukon government rescinded the health advisory for  limiting the consumption of fish from Lake Laberge.",15/01/2013,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,80-92,,,443,,Sci Total Environ,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Microalgal  astaxanthin (MA) is a natural carotenoid that enhances viability of a variety of  fish. To investigate the immunotoxicity of LC and the improvement effect of MA in  lymphocytes (Cyprinus carpio), lymphocytes were treated with LC (80 M) and/or MA  (50 M) for 24 h. Firstly, CCK8 combined with PI staining results showed that MA  significantly attenuated the LC-induced lymphocyte death rate. Secondly, LC  exposure resulted in excessively damaged mitochondrial and mtROS, diminished  mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content, which could be improved by MA.  Thirdly, MA upregulated the levels of mitophagy-related regulatory factors  (Beclin1, LC3, ATG5, Tom20 and Lamp2) induced by LC. Importantly, MA decreased  the levels of pyroptosis-related genes treated with LC, including NLRP3, Cas-4,  GSDMD and active Cas-1. Further study indicated that LC treatment caused  excessive miRNA-194-5p and reduced levels of FoxO1, PINK1 and Parkin, which was  inhibited by MA treatment. Overall, we concluded that MA could enhance damaged  mitochondrial elimination by promoting the  miRNA-194-5p-FoxO1-PINK1/Parkin-mitophagy in lymphocytes, which reduced mtROS  accumulation and alleviated pyroptosis.

Cadmium (Cd) is a genotoxic heavy metal that has  been recognized as a human carcinogen. Oxidant stress and inhibition of DNA  repair have been proposed as major factors underlying Cd genotoxicity. Our  previous studies indicated the ability of Cd to disturb the gene expression of  MSH6 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. This study was undertaken to explore if  Cd-induced oxidative stress down-regulated MSH gene activities. Following the  exposure of zebrafish embryos at 1 h post fertilization (hpf) to sublethal  concentrations of Cd at 3-5 μM for 4 or 9 h, a parallel down-regulation of MSH2,  MSH6 and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) gene expression was detected by  real-time RT-PCR and the expression levels were 40-50% of control after a 9-h  exposure. Cd exposure also induced oxidative stress, yet no inhibition of  catalase gene activity was observed. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed a  wide distribution of msh6 mRNA in the head regions of 10 hpf embryos and  pretreatment of embryos with antioxidants butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), d-mannitol  or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at 1-10 μM restored Cd-suppressed msh6 expression. QPCR  confirmed the protective effects of antioxidants on Cd-suppressed msh2/msh6 mRNA  production. Down-regulated MSH gene activities reaching about 50% of control were  also induced in embryos exposed to paraquat, a reactive oxygen species  (ROS)-generating herbicide, or hydrogen peroxide at 200 μM. Hence, Cd at  sublethal levels down-regulates msh2/msh6 expression primarily via ROS as  signaling molecules. The transcriptional activation of human msh6 is known to be  fully dependent on the specificity factor 1 (Sp1). Cd failed to inhibit the DNA  binding activity of zebrafish Sp1 unless at lethal concentrations based on band  shift assay, therefore excluding the involvement of Sp1 inactivation in  Cd-induced MSH gene inhibition in zebrafish embryos.",15/01/2013,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,Sep-16,,,126,,Aquat Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Seafood is known to contain nutrients beneficial for  the normal development and function of the brain, but also contaminants such as  PCBs which are neurotoxic. Exposure to non-coplanar PCBs during brain development  can disrupt spontaneous behaviour in mice and lead to hyperactive behaviour.  Humans are chronically exposed to the highest relative levels of organochlorines  in early childhood during brain development, though usually at doses which do not  give clinical symptoms of toxicity. This study aimed to elucidate the  developmental and behavioural effects of 2,2',4,4',5,5' hexachlorobiphenyl  (PCB153) in mice, mimicking human exposure during gestation and lactation.  METHODS: Environmentally relevant doses of PCB153 were added to the experimental  diets. Feed concentrations were approximately 0.5, 6.5, and 1500 μg PCB153/kg  feed, representing a realistic and a worst case scenario of frequent consumption  of contaminated fish. The study also investigated the effects of maternal  nutrition, i.e. a standard rodent diet versus a high inclusion of salmon. Mice  pups were examined for physical- and reflex development, sensorimotor function  and spontaneous behaviour from five days after birth until weaning. A selection  of pups were followed until 16 weeks of age and tested for open field behaviour  and the acoustic startle response (ASR) with prepulse inhibition (PPI). Blood  thyroid hormones and liver enzymes, blood lipids and PCB153 content in fat were  examined at 16 weeks. Statistical analyses modelled the three way interactions of  diet, PCB exposure and litter size on behaviour, using generalized linear models  (GLM) and linear mixed effect models (LME). The litter was used as a random  variable. Non-parametric tests were used for pair wise comparisons of biochemical  analyses. RESULTS: Litter size consistently influenced pup development and  behaviour. Few lasting PCB153 related changes were observed, but results  indicated effects on synchronization of physical development. Perinatal PCB153  exposure appeared to reduce habituation and cause aggression in males, though not  statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Litter size and maternal diet influenced  physical development and function more than PCB153 in perinatally exposed mouse  pups and supports the developmental importance of maternal care and the social  environment.",13/01/2011,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,3,,,7,,Behav Brain Funct,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 21232145  PMCID: PMC3033814,,,,"Male; Animals; Female; Pregnancy; Mice; Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects; Adipose Tissue/chemistry; Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis/*toxicity; Behavior, Animal/*drug effects; Exploratory Behavior/drug effects; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Reflex, Startle/drug effects; Liver/enzymology; Lipids/blood; Litter Size; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/blood/*psychology; Thyroid Hormones/blood",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the  leucocytes present in the peritoneal exudate of the infected fish (macrophages,  neutrophils, eosinophilic granular cells, lymphocytes and thrombocytes),  macrophages and neutrophils were the only phagocytic cells. Neutrophils were  easily distinguished from macrophages in Antonow stained preparations by the  pattern of peroxidase positivity. Using ultrastructural cytochemistry,  neutrophils were found to have abundant cytoplasmic granules positive for  peroxidase and arylsulphatase and were negative for alpha-naphthyl butyrate (ANB)  esterase. In contrast, ANB esterase activity was detected in macrophages. These  leucocytes were typically negative for peroxidase, but ocasionally, some  macrophages with peroxidase or arylsulphatase-positive vacuoles were observed.  Both phagocytes had cytoplasmic granules positive for acid phosphatase. Glycogen  particles were found in the cytoplasm of the two phagocytic cells, but they were  much more abundant in neutrophils. Macrophages were much more abundant than  neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity of non-injected sea bass but early after the  intraperitoneal injection of bacteria, the number of neutrophils increased  quickly and extensively. Higher numbers of intraperitoneally injected bacteria  were found inside macrophages as compared to neutrophils because macrophages  strongly predominated in the peritoneal population at the time of injection.  However, when the bacteria were injected into peritoneal cavities with high  numbers of neutrophils (attracted by a previous injection of 12% casein), the  percentage of neutrophils with phagocytosed bacteria increased, approaching that  of infected macrophages. Taken together, these results show that in sea bass, as  in many other organisms, in addition to macrophages, neutrophils are important  phagocytic cells, the relative participation of each of the two phagocytes in  defense mechanisms against infection depending on the opportunity to encounter  the invading infectious agents.",2002-09,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,183-198,,3,13,,Fish Shellfish Immunol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 12365730,,,,"Animals; Phagocytosis; *Bass; Injections, Intraperitoneal/veterinary; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/chemistry; Fish Diseases/immunology/*pathology; Histocytochemistry/veterinary; Macrophages/immunology/*pathology/ultrastructure; Neutrophils/immunology/*pathology/ultrastructure; Peritoneal Cavity/cytology/microbiology/*pathology; Peritonitis/immunology/pathology/*veterinary; Peroxidase/chemistry; Phagocytes/immunology/pathology/ultrastructure; Photobacterium/immunology; Staining and Labeling/veterinary",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These sources of contamination  are numerous and include herbicides, which represent a large group of toxic  chemicals. Quinclorac, an herbicide widely applied in agriculture, induces  oxidative stress due to free radical generation and changes in the antioxidant  defense system. The aim of this study was to assess if dietary diphenyl  diselenide (PhSe)₂ has a protective effect in tissues of fish species Cyprinus  carpio exposed to the quinclorac herbicide. The fish were fed with either a  standard or a diet containing 3.0 mg/Kg of diphenyl diselenide for 60 d. After  were exposed to 1 mg/L of Facet® (quinclorac commercial formulation) for 192 h.

In  fish exposed to quinclorac and feeding with standard diet TBARS levels increased  in liver and gills. However, SOD activity decreases in liver whereas no  alterations were observed in catalase activity in this tissue. Quinclorac also  decrease GST activity in liver and brain, NPSH in brain and muscle and ascorbic  acid in muscle. Concerning protein carbonyl exposed to herbicide the fish did not  show any alterations. The diphenyl diselenide supplemented diet reversed these  effects, preventing increases in TBARS levels in liver and gills. GST activity  was recovered to control values in liver. NPSH levels in brain and muscle  increased remain near to control values.

Here we show in the gilthead seabream, an  immunologically tractable teleost fish model, that the first lymphocyte marker  genes, those coding for the two subunits for the recombination activating gene,  were detected by RT-PCR around 21-27 days post-hatching (dph). In addition, the  transcripts coding for the alpha and beta subunits of the T-cell receptor and the  light and heavy chains of immunoglobulin M were detected at 27-48 dph. However,  most innate immune genes analyzed were already expressed at hatching, including  those coding for the toll-like receptors, pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules,  antiviral and antibacterial factors, and phagocyte markers.

All tests were run on prochloraz (imidazole  fungicide), bentazone (diazine herbicide), and nicosulfuron (sulfonylurea  herbicide). Behavioral effects were assessed, at four concentrations (10  microg/L, 100 microg/L, 1 mg/L, 10 mg/L), on endpoints related to swimming  pattern (preference-avoidance responses, burst swimming reactions), comfort  activities (buccal movements, feeding attempts), and social relations  (antagonistic acts, grouping).

Part A,,1528-7394 0098-4108,10.1080/15287394.2014.919837,,"Methylmercury (MeHg) has been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease in some but not all epidemiology studies. These inconsistent results may  stem from the fact that exposure typically occurs in the context of fish  consumption, which is also associated with cardioprotective factors such as  omega-3 fatty acids. Mechanistic information may help to understand whether MeHg  represents a risk to cardiovascular health. MeHg is a pro-oxidant that  inactivates protein sulfhydryls. These biochemical effects may diminish critical  antioxidant defense mechanism(s) involved in protecting against atherosclerosis.  One such defense mechanism is paraoxonase-1 (PON1), an enzyme present on  high-density lipoproteins and that prevents the oxidation of blood lipids and  their deposition in vascular endothelium. PON1 is potentially useful as a  clinical biomarker of cardiovascular risk, as well as a critical enzyme in the  detoxification of certain organophosphate oxons. MeHg and other metals are known  to inhibit PON1 activity in vitro. MeHg is associated with lowered serum PON1  activity in a fish-eating population. The implications of lowering PON1 are  evaluated by predicting the shift in PON1 population distribution induced by  various doses of MeHg. An MeHg dose of 0.3 μg/kg/d is estimated to decrease the  population average PON1 level by 6.1% and to increase population risk of acute  cardiovascular events by 9.7%. This evaluation provides a plausible mechanism for  MeHg-induced cardiovascular risk and suggests means to quantify the risk. This  case study exemplifies the use of upstream disease biomarkers to evaluate the  additive effect of chemical toxicity with background disease processes in  assessing human risk.",2014,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,1004-1023,,17,77,,J Toxicol Environ Health A,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 25072822,,,,"Humans; Animals; Risk Factors; Mice; Fishes; Risk Assessment; Antioxidants/metabolism; Disease Models, Animal; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Food Contamination/analysis; Methylmercury Compounds/*toxicity; Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism; Aryldialkylphosphatase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Cardiovascular Diseases/*chemically induced/pathology; Fatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage; Lipid Metabolism/physiology; Meat/analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zebrafish CD44a deficiency inhibits cell growth and proliferation, impairs cell  growth and death pathways, and regulates the expression levels of many genes  involved in p53 signaling, apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, CD44a gene  disruption in zebrafish leads to inhibition of apoptosis and induction of  autophagy, with the increased susceptibility to E. piscicida infection.  Furthermore, we show that zebrafish CD44a variants including CD44a_tv1 and  CD44a_tv2 promote the translocation of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and  interact with p53 in the cytoplasm.

These  neurobehavioral injuries have been linked to reduced survival and population  declines. Despite the importance of maintaining proper olfactory signaling  processes in the presence of chemical exposures, little is known regarding  chemical detoxification in the salmon olfactory system, and in particular, the  antioxidant defenses that maintain olfactory function. An understudied, yet  critical component of cellular antioxidant defense is phospholipid hydroperoxide  glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx/GPx4), an isoform within the family of  selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzymes that can directly reduce  lipid peroxides and other membrane-bound complex hydroperoxides. In this study,  we cloned two gpx4 isoforms (gpx4a and gpx4b) from Coho salmon olfactory tissues  and compared their modulation in olfactory and liver tissues by cadmium, an  environmental pollutant and olfactory toxicant that cause oxidative damage as a  mechanism of toxicity. Amino acid sequence comparisons of the two gpx4 isoforms  shared 71% identity, and also relatively high sequence identities when compared  with other fish GPx4 isoforms. Sequence comparisons with human GPx4 indicated  conservation of three important active sites at selenocysteine (U46), glutamine  (Q81), and tryptophan (W136), suggesting similar catalytic activity between fish  and mammalian GPx4 isoforms. Tissue profiling confirmed the expression of gpx4a  and gpx4b in all ten Coho tissues examined. The expression of gpx4 mRNAs in the  Coho olfactory system was accompanied by comparably high initial rates of GPx4  enzymatic activity in mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. Exposure to low (3.7  ppb) and high (347 ppb) environmental Cd concentrations for 24-48 h significantly  decreased gpx4a expression in Coho olfactory rosettes, whereas olfactory gpx4b  mRNA expression was not modulated by exposures at these concentrations. In  summary, Coho salmon express two paralogs of gpx4, a key enzyme in the  maintenance of signal transduction processes that protect against cellular  oxidative damage. The Cd-associated downregulation of salmon olfactory gpx4a  expression in particular, may be associated with the loss of olfactory signal  transduction that accompanies metal-associated loss of olfaction in salmonids.",15/06/2012,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,134-141,,,114-115,,Aquat Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Some important control interventions (e.g.  long-lasting insecticidal nests) have contributed to reduce malaria morbidity and  mortality in different parts of the world. Moreover, the development and  effective use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) hold promise to further enhance  the control and elimination of malaria, particularly in areas where health  services are deficient. The aim of this study was to determine knowledge,  attitudes, practices and beliefs in relation to RDTs for malaria in rural Côte  d'Ivoire. METHODS: One hundred individuals from Bozi and Yoho who sought care at  the health centre in Bozi and were offered an RDT for malaria were interviewed in  April 2010 using a pre-tested questionnaire on practice and perceptions in  relation to RDTs for malaria. The relationships between acceptance of RDTs and  factors related to opinions were identified, using generalized linear mixed  models. Qualitative data from open-ended questions complemented the quantitative  analysis. RESULTS: Only 34 out of 100 patients who were offered an RDT for  malaria were willing to undergo the test. People who perceived blood as a sacred  body fluid were less likely to comply with an RDT. The concurrent availability  and use of RDTs for HIV and malaria was associated with an unwilling attitude  towards RDTs for malaria (Fisher's exact test, p <0.001). The initial willingness  of patients to accept malaria testing with RDTs was significantly related to  general fear and wanting to know malaria infection status. For further and  regular use of RDTs, a strong relationship was observed between acceptance and  the idea that an RDT is a pretext used by health worker to know HIV status (odds  ratio (OR) = 16.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-268.5). Those thinking  that blood samples were useful for medical diagnoses were 8.31-times (95% CI =  2.22-31.1) more likely to undergo an RDT compared to those rejecting blood  sampling as a diagnostic strategy. CONCLUSION: Socio-cultural factors might be  barriers for accepting RDTs in general health services. There are social  representations of malaria and HIV/AIDS, symbolic for blood or experiences in  relation to blood taking and blood-related diseases in relation to the  introduction and routine use of RDTs. Special attention should be given to these  barriers as otherwise the promotion of RDTs for prompt and effective diagnosis  and subsequent management of malaria is hampered.",18/12/2012,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,1089,,,12,,BMC Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 23249239  PMCID: PMC3543836,,,,"Humans; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Adult; Young Adult; Linear Models; Adolescent; Surveys and Questionnaires; *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; *Rural Population; Cote d'Ivoire; Diagnostic Tests, Routine/*statistics & numerical data; Malaria/*diagnosis/prevention & control; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*psychology/statistics & numerical data; Social Class",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we evaluated the effects of the sulfated  polysaccharide ulvan from Ulva ohnoi on Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis)  juveniles at the transcriptomic level. Cytotoxicity assay performed in liver  primary cell cultures from sole determined that the different ulvan  concentrations assayed did not impair cell viability. Juveniles were  intraperitoneally (IP) injected with ulvan (0.5 mg/fish) followed by a challenge  with Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp) at 7 days. RNASeq analyses  at 2 days post injection (dpi) revealed that 402 transcripts were differentially  expressed in liver between ulvan IP injected and control groups before the  challenge. Genes related to bacterial and antiviral defence, complement system,  chemokines, proteasomes and antigen presentation were upregulated in ulvan  treated groups. A detailed expression analysis of sixteen genes related to innate  and adaptive immune system was performed in two systemic tissues: liver and  spleen. Ulvan injection provoked the upregulation of tlr22 and a transient  inflammatory response was initiated in both liver and spleen at 2 dpi. As  consequence, expression of acute phase proteins, antimicrobial peptides and  complement genes was induced. Moreover, expression of mhcI, mhcII, psmb10 and  bcl6 was also induced 2 dpi. At 2 dpi with Phdp, inflammatory cytokines and genes  related to bacterial and antiviral defense, iron metabolism, complement system  and antigen presentation were differentially modulated in survival juveniles  previously IP injected with ulvan. Moreover, mortality was retarded in ulvan  treated juveniles.

The fish were collected in  temporary ponds and exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of the  herbicide (5 mg.L(-1) for 96 h). The production of ROS, lipid peroxidation, DNA  damage, and membrane fluidity were evaluated in the blood cells by flow  cytometry. The mRNA expression of the antioxidant-related genes sod2, cat, gstα,  atp1a1, gclc, and ucp1 across the brain, liver, and gills was quantified. The  acute exposure of annual killifish to Roundup significantly increased ROS  production, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage in their erythrocytes. Likewise,  Roundup Transorb® decreased membrane fluidity in the blood cells of the exposed  fish. Gene expression analysis revealed that Roundup exposure alters the relative  expression of genes associated with oxidative stress and antioxidant defense.

Although ITNs have been  widely distributed to malaria-endemic regions in the past, their success has been  threatened by misuses (in fishing, agriculture etc.) and decay in ITN efficacy.  Decision-making in using the ITNs depends on multiple coevolving factors: malaria  prevalence, mosquito density, ITN availability and its efficacy, and other  socio-economic determinants. While ITN misuse increases as the efficacy of ITNs  declines, high efficacy also impedes proper use due to free-riding. This  irrational usage leads to increased malaria prevalence, thereby worsening malaria  control efforts. It also remains unclear if the optimum ITN use for malaria  elimination can be achieved under such an adaptive social learning process. Here,  we incorporate evolutionary game theory into a disease transmission model to  demonstrate these behavioural interactions and their impact on malaria  prevalence. We show that social optimum usage is a function of transmission  potential, ITN efficacy and mosquito demography. Under specific parameter  regimes, our model exhibits patterns of ITN usage similar to observed data from  parts of Africa. Our study suggests that the provision of financial incentives as  prompt feedback to improper ITN use can reduce misuse and contribute positively  towards malaria elimination efforts in Africa and elsewhere.",2022-11,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,220685,,11,9,,R Soc Open Sci,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022 The Authors.,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 36405633  PMCID: PMC9667140,,,,evolutionary game theory; insecticide-treated nets; malaria; social optimum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During infection by Phdp,  AIP56 is systemically disseminated and induces apoptosis of macrophages and  neutrophils, compromising the host phagocytic defence and contributing to the  genesis of pathology.

Here, we examine the effect of a widely used pesticide,  chlorpyrifos, on the retention of acquired predator recognition in post-larval  stage of the surgeonfish Acanthurus triostegus. Through associative learning,  post-larvae of A. triostegus were first observed to forage significantly less in  the presence of conspecific alarm cues and alarm cues associated to a predator's  odor. The retention of this anti-predator behavior was estimated to last between  2 and 5 days in the absence of pesticide.

Susceptibility of different tissues to oxidative DNA  damage was studied by exposing fish to model pollutants. Cu(II), paraquat (PQ)  and malathion failed to promote DNA oxidation in liver, while dieldrin  significantly increased the 8-oxodG content in this organ, but not in gills or  blood. After PQ exposure, fish liver showed high levels of glucose-6-P  dehydrogenase (G-6PDH) and GSSG reductase activities. The increased antioxidant  status and the lack of a specific transport system could explain the lack of  susceptibility of liver to DNA oxidative damage induced by PQ. Increased levels  of 8-oxodG were detected in the gills of PQ-exposed fish after 8 and 24 h. In  contrast, after 48 h exposed fish contained lower 8-oxodG levels than controls.  The existence of a PQ transport system in this O2-rich organ and the lack of a  significant increase in antioxidant defenses would explain the sensitivity of  gills to DNA damage promoted by PQ. Elimination of this soluble chemical and the  putative induction of DNA-repair enzymes specific for oxidative damages could  explain the drop of 8-oxodG levels at longer times. Fish exposed to moderate  levels of urban and industrial pollution showed significantly high 8-oxodG  content in hepatic DNA.

Two eco-types of killer whales, 'transient' and  'resident', occur in all of these regions. These eco-types are genetically  distinct and differ in various aspects of morphology, vocalization patterns, diet  and habitat use. Various genetic and photo-identification studies of eastern  North Pacific killer whales have provided information on the male-female  composition of most of these resident pods and transient groups, as well as the  approximate ages, reproductive status and putative recruitment order (birth  order) of the individual whales. Biopsy blubber samples of free-ranging resident  and transient killer whales from the Kenai Fjords/Prince William Sound, AK region  were acquired during the 1994-1999 field seasons and analyzed for selected  organochlorines (OCs), including dioxin-like CB congeners and DDTs.  Concentrations of OCs in transient killer whales (marine mammal-eating) were much  higher than those found in resident animals (fish-eating) apparently due to  differences in diets of these two killer whale eco-types. Certain life-history  parameters such as sex, age and reproductive status also influenced the  concentrations of OCs in the Alaskan killer whales. Reproductive female whales  contained much lower levels of OCs than sexually immature whales or mature male  animals in the same age class likely due to transfer of OCs from the female to  her offspring during gestation and lactation. Recruitment order also influenced  the concentrations of OCs in the Alaskan killer whales. In adult male residents,  first-recruited whales contained much higher OC concentrations than those  measured in non-first-recruited (e.g. second recruited, third recruited) resident  animals in the same age group.

The biosynthesis of silver  nanoparticles (AgNPs) is currently considered an environmental friendly  alternative to the employ of pyrethroids, carbamates and microbial agents (e.g.  Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis), since AgNPs are easy to produce,  effective and stable in the aquatic environment. However, their biophysical  features showed wide variations according to the botanical agent using for the  green synthesis, outlining the importance of screening local floral resources  used as reducing and stabilizing agents. In this study, we focused on the  biophysical properties and the mosquitocidal action of Quisqualis  indica-fabricated AgNPs. AgNPs were characterized using spectroscopic (UV, FTIR,  XRD) and microscopic (AFM, SEM, TEM and EDX) techniques. AFM, SEM and TEM  confirmed the synthesis of poly-dispersed AgNPs with spherical shape and size  ranging from 1 to 30nm. XRD shed light on the crystalline structure of these  AgNPs. The acute toxicity of Quisqualis indica extract and AgNPs was evaluated  against malaria, arbovirus, and filariasis vectors, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes  aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, as well as on three important non-target  aquatic organisms. The Q. indica leaf extract showed moderate larvicidal  effectiveness on Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50=220.42), Ae. aegypti (LC50=203.63)  and An. stephensi (LC50=185.98). Q. indica-fabricated AgNPs showed high toxicity  against Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50=14.63), Ae. aegypti (LC50=13.55) and An.  stephensi (LC50=12.52), respectively. Notably, Q. indica-synthesized AgNPs were  moderately toxic to non-target aquatic mosquito predators Anisops bouvieri  (LC50=653.05μg/mL), Diplonychus indicus (LC50=860.94μg/mL) and Gambusia affinis  (LC50=2183.16μg/mL), if compared to the targeted mosquitoes. Overall, the  proposed one-pot biogenic fabrication of AgNPs using Q. indica is a low-cost and  eco-friendly tool in the fight against Zika virus, malaria and filariasis  vectors, with little impact against non-target aquatic mosquito predators.",2016-09,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,646-655,,,162,,J Photochem Photobiol B,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using high taxonomic and temporal resolution, we contrast the  dominance structure of carabids and dynamics of the most abundant species in  maize (both sweet and field corn) agroecosystems using pest management tactics  determined by the purchase of seed and application of pyrethroid insecticides. In  the seed-based treatments, sweet corn contained Cry1Ab/c proteins, whereas field  corn contained the coupled technology of Cry3Bb1 proteins for control of corn  rootworm and neonicotinoid seed treatments aimed at secondary soil-borne pests.  The insecticide treatments involved foliar pyrethroids in sweet corn and  at-planting pyrethroids in field corn. The carabid community, comprised of 49  species, was dominated by four species, Scarites quadriceps Chaudoir, Poecilus  chalcites Say, Pterostichus melanarius Illiger, and Harpalus pensylvanicus  DeGeer, that each occupied a distinct temporal niche during the growing season.  Two species, Pt. melanarius and H. pensylvanicus, exhibited differences between  treatments over time. Only H. pensylvanicus had consistent results in both years,  in which activity densities in field corn were significantly higher in the  control in July and/or August. These results, along with laboratory bioassays,  led us to hypothesize that lower adult captures resulted from decrease in prey  availability or exposure of H. pensylvanicus larvae to soil-directed  insecticides-either the neonicotinoid seed treatment in the transgenic field corn  or an at-planting soil insecticide in the conventional field corn.",2009-06,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,935-943,,3,38,,Environ Entomol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 19508805,,,,"Animals; Population Dynamics; *Insecticides; *Ecosystem; *Bacterial Proteins; *Coleoptera; *Endotoxins; *Hemolysin Proteins; *Seasons; Agriculture/methods; Bacillus thuringiensis Toxins; Insect Control/methods; Plants, Genetically Modified; Zea mays/genetics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A variety of illnesses are initiated or aided by the presence of  certain perturbing factors. In the case of autism spectrum disorder, the  environmental component plays an important part in determining the overall  picture. Moreover, the lack of therapies to relieve existing symptoms complicates  the fight against this condition. As a result, animal models have been used to  make biomedical research easier and more suited for disease investigations. The  current study used zebrafish as an animal model to mimic a real-life scenario:  acute exposure to an increased dose of pesticides, followed by prospective  intervention-based therapy with vitamin B(12) (vit. B(12)). It is known that vit.  B(12) is involved in brain function nerve tissue, and red blood cell formation.  Aside from this, the role of vit. B(12) in the redox processes is recognized for  its help against free radicals. To investigate the effect of vit. B(12), fish  were divided into four different groups and exposed to a pesticide mixture (600  μg L(-1) fipronil + 600 μg L(-1) pyriproxyfen) and 0.24 μg L(-1) vit. B(12) for  14 days. The impact of the compounds was assessed daily with EthoVision XT 11.5  software for behavioral observations, especially for sociability, quantified by  the social interaction test. In addition, at the end of the study, the activities  of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde  (MDA) were measured. The results showed significant improvements in locomotor  activity parameters and a positive influence of the vitamin on sociability.  Regarding the state of oxidative stress, high activity was found for SOD and GPx  in the case of vit. B(12), while fish exposed to the mixture of pesticides and  vit. B(12) had a lower level of MDA. In conclusion, the study provides new data  about the effect of vit.

The insecticide caused a reduction in the number of erythrocytes  and hemoglobin content after 96 h exposure, probably due to hemolysis.  Hyperglycemic response indicated energy mobilization, and may have contributed to  the increase in osmolarity after 96 h exposure to DFB. The induction of  glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase activities in liver pointed to the  activation of xenobiotic metabolic pathways and antioxidant defenses. The  decrease in muscle AChE at all experimental times showed that DFB is an AChE  inhibitor. In addition, DFB induced hepatic alterations that might impair normal  liver functions.

L.; Richter, Manuela",In vitro assessment of modes of toxic action of pharmaceuticals in aquatic life.,Environmental science & technology,,0013-936X,10.1021/es048590e,,"An ecotoxicological test battery based on a mode-of-action approach was designed and applied to the hazard identification and classification of modes of action of  six pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, ethinyl estradiol, ibuprofen,  propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole). The rationale behind the design of the  battery was to cover the relevant interactions that a compound may have with  biological targets. It is thus not comprehensive but contains representative  examples of each category of mode of toxic action including nonspecific,  specific, and reactive toxicity. The test battery consists of one test system for  nonspecific toxicity (baseline toxicity or narcosis), two test systems for  specific effects, and two test systems for reactive toxicity. The baseline  toxicity was quantified with the Kinspec test, which detects membrane leakage via  measurements of membrane potential. This test system may also be used to detect  the specific effects on energy transduction, although this was not relevant to  any compound investigated in this study. As examples of specific  receptor-mediated toxicity, we chose the yeast estrogen screen (YES) as a  specific test for estrogenicity, and the inhibition of chlorophyll fluorescence  in algae to assess specific effects on photosynthesis. Reactive modes of action  were assessed indirectly by measuring the relevance of cellular defense systems.  Differences in growth inhibition curves between a mutant of Escherichia coli that  could not synthesize glutathione and its parent strain indicate the relevance of  conjugation with glutathione as a defense mechanism, which is an indirect  indicator of protein damage. DNA damage was assessed by comparing the growth  inhibition in a strain that lacks various DNA repair systems with that in its  competent parent strain. Most compounds acted merely as baseline toxicants in all  test systems. As expected, ethinylestradiol was the only compound showing  estrogenic activity. Propranolol was baseline-toxic in all test systems  exceptforthe photosynthesis inhibition assay, where it surprisingly showed a  100-fold excess toxicity over the predicted baseline effect. The exact mode of  toxic action could not be confirmed, but additional chlorophyll fluorescence  induction experiments excluded the possibility of direct interference with  photosynthesis through photosystem II inhibition. Mixture experiments were  performed as a diagnostic tool to analyze the mode of toxic action. Compounds  with the same mode of toxic action showed the expected concentration addition. In  the photosynthesis inhibition assay, agreement between experimental results and  prediction was best for two-stage predictions considering the assigned modes of  action. In a two-stage prediction, concentration addition was used as a model to  predict the mixture effect of the baseline toxicants followed by their  independent action as a single component combined with the specifically acting  compound propranolol and the reference compound diuron. A comparison with acute  toxicity data for algae, daphnia, and fish showed generally good agreement for  the nonspecifically acting compounds but also that the proposed test battery  offered better diagnostic value in the case of the specifically acting compounds.",01/05/2005,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,3090-3100,,9,39,,Environ Sci Technol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 15926557,,,,"Animals; Fishes; Risk Assessment; Toxicity Tests; *Food Chain; Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity; Daphnia; *Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; *Models, Theoretical; Eukaryota",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the effects of TCF  on the antioxidant defense system, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and  stress responses in various tissues of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). C.carpio  L. were exposed to different concentrations of TCF (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and  4 mg L(-)(1)) at 25 and 15 °C for two weeks (measurements were taken after week 1  and 2). TCF exposure induced significant alterations in antioxidant responses in  the gills and the liver. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and  glutathione S-transferase (GST) increased considerably after TCF exposure,  depending on water temperature, whereas catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH)  levels decreased notably after one and two weeks. Remarkable antioxidant  responses were observed in the gills, suggesting the gills were more sensitive to  oxidative stress than the liver based on CAT, GST, and GSH levels. Notable  increases in MDA levels were observed in the gills and the liver. AChE activity  was significantly inhibited in the brain and muscles even at the lowest TCF  concentration of 0.5 mg L(-)(1), indicating neurotoxicity following TCF exposure.  As a stress indicator, plasma cortisol was significantly elevated following  exposure to TCF depending on water temperature, thereby enhancing stress. These  results suggest that TCF exposure can induce considerable alterations in  antioxidant responses, neurotoxicity, and stress reaction depending on water  temperature.

Factors underlying failure of the immune protection against bacteria remain  largely unknown. The reported study used a transcriptomic approach to address  this issue. Juvenile sea breams (0.5 g) were challenged by immersion in salt  water containing 2.89 × 10(8) CFU of a virulent Phdp and the head kidney was  sampled after 24- and 48-h. Analyses were performed using the second version of a  44 k oligonucleotide DNA microarray that represents 19,734 sea bream unique  transcripts and covers diverse immune pathways. Expression changes of selected  immune genes were validated with qPCR. Results suggested rapid recognition of the  pathogen, as testified by up-regulation of lectins and antibacterial proteins  (bactericidal permeability-increasing protein lectins, lysozyme, intracellular  and extracellular proteases), chemokines and chemokine receptors. Increased  expression of proteins involved in iron and heme metabolism also could be a  response against bacteria that are dependent on iron. However, negative  regulators of immune/inflammatory response were preponderant among the  up-regulated genes. A remarkable finding was the increased expression of IL-10 in  concert with up-regulation of arginase I and II and proteins of the polyamine  biosynthesis pathway that diverts the arginine flux from the production of  reactive nitrogen species. Such expression changes are characteristic for  alternatively activated macrophages that do not develop acute inflammatory  responses.

This study examined whether  the Northeast Cape FUDS is a source of exposure to OC pesticides. In total, 71  serum samples were collected during site remediation from volunteers who  represented three geographic regions of the island. In addition, ninespine  stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) and Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) were  collected from Northeast Cape after remediation to assess continuing presence of  OC pesticides. Chlordane compounds, DDT compounds, mirex, and hexachlorobenzene  (HCB) were the most prevalent and present at the highest concentrations in both  fish tissues and human serum samples. After controlling for age and gender,  activities near the Northeast Cape FUDS were associated with an increase in serum  HCB as compared to residents of the farthest village from the site. Positive but  nonsignificant relationships for sum-chlordane and sum-DDT were also found.  Organochlorine concentrations in fish samples did not show clear geographic  trends, but appear elevated compared to other sites in Alaska.

The evolution of resistance (a  heritable decrease in susceptibility to Bt toxins) can pose a threat to sustained  control of target pests, but a high-dose refuge (HDR) management strategy has  been key to delaying countervailing evolution of Bt resistance. The HDR strategy  relies on the mating frequency between susceptible and resistant individuals, so  either partial dominance of resistant alleles or nonrandom mating in the pest  population itself could elevate the pace of resistance evolution. Using classic  Wright-Fisher genetic models, we investigated the impact of deviations from  standard refuge model assumptions on resistance evolution in the pest  populations. We show that when Bt selection is strong, even deviations from  random mating and/or strictly recessive resistance that are below the threshold  of detection can yield dramatic increases in the pace of resistance evolution.  Resistance evolution is hastened whenever the order of magnitude of model  violations exceeds the initial frequency of resistant alleles. We also show that  the existence of a fitness cost for resistant individuals on the refuge crop  cannot easily overcome the effect of violated HDR assumptions. We propose a  parametrically explicit framework that enables both comparison of various field  situations and model inference. Using this model, we propose novel empiric  estimators of the pace of resistance evolution (and time to loss of control),  whose simple calculation relies on the observed change in resistance allele  frequency.",2016-04,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,596-607,,4,9,,Evol Appl,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 27099624  PMCID: PMC4831461,,,,fitness cost; high‐dose; incomplete resistance; insecticide resistance; nonrandom mating; partial dominance; refuge strategy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to rise in resistance against existing pesticides, development of novel drugs  or vaccines is necessary. Posttranscriptional gene silencing by RNA interference  (RNAi), when established in a high throughput system is a potential method for  evaluation of molecular targets for new medical compounds or vaccine antigens.  Successful use of RNAi has been reported in several stages of salmon lice.  However, when we employed a previously described protocol for planktonic stages,  no reproducible down-regulation of target genes was gained. In the present study,  we describe a robust method for RNAi, where nauplius larvae are soaked in  seawater added double stranded RNA (dsRNA). In order to test for when dsRNA may  be introduced, and for the efficacy and duration of RNAi, we performed a series  of experiments on accurately age determined larvae, ranging from the hatching egg  to the copepodid with a salmon louse coatomer and a putative prostaglandin E  synthase gene. Presumptive knock-down was monitored by real time PCR. Significant  gene silencing was obtained only when nauplius I larvae were exposed to dsRNA  during the period in which they molted to nauplius II. A knock down effect could  be detected 2days after soaking, and it remained stable until the last  measurement, on day 12. Soaking nauplius I larvae, knock-down was verified for  six additional genes with a putative role in molting. For one chitinase, a  loss-of-function phenotype with abnormal swimming was obtained. Hence, RNAi,  induced in the nauplius, may facilitate studies of the molecular biology of the  louse, such as the function of specific genes in developmental processes and  physiology, host recognition, host-parasite interaction, and, in extension, the  engineering of novel medicines.",2014-05,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,44-51,,,140,,Exp Parasitol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: Information on time to pregnancy,  miscarriages, and subfertility was collected retrospectively by self-administered  questionnaires in two cohorts of fishermen's sisters from the Swedish east coast,  by the Baltic Sea, and the west coast, where fish are less contaminated. Along  with cohort affiliation, fish consumption and growing up in a fishing village or  fisherman's family were used as measures of exposure within the eastcoast cohort  (ie, the exposed cohort).

The  ways in which stratospheric ozone depletion is directly altering climate in the  southern hemisphere and the consequent extensive effects on aquatic ecosystems  are also addressed. The primary objective is to synthesise novel findings over  the past four years in the context of the existing understanding of ecosystem  response to UV radiation and the interactive effects of climate change. If it  were not for the Montreal Protocol, stratospheric ozone depletion would have led  to high levels of exposure to solar UV radiation with much stronger negative  effects on all trophic levels in aquatic ecosystems than currently experienced in  both inland and oceanic waters. This ""world avoided"" scenario that has curtailed  ozone depletion, means that climate change and other environmental variables will  play the primary role in regulating the exposure of aquatic organisms to solar UV  radiation. Reductions in the thickness and duration of snow and ice cover are  increasing the levels of exposure of aquatic organisms to UV radiation. Climate  change was also expected to increase exposure by causing shallow mixed layers,  but new data show deepening in some regions and shoaling in others. In contrast,  climate-change related increases in heavy precipitation and melting of glaciers  and permafrost are increasing the concentration and colour of UV-absorbing  dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulates. This is leading to the  ""browning"" of many inland and coastal waters, with consequent loss of the  valuable ecosystem service in which solar UV radiation disinfects surface waters  of parasites and pathogens. Many organisms can reduce damage due to exposure to  UV radiation through behavioural avoidance, photoprotection, and photoenzymatic  repair, but meta-analyses continue to confirm negative effects of UV radiation  across all trophic levels. Modeling studies estimating photoinhibition of primary  production in parts of the Pacific Ocean have demonstrated that the UV radiation  component of sunlight leads to a 20% decrease in estimates of primary  productivity. Exposure to UV radiation can also lead to positive effects on some  organisms by damaging less UV-tolerant predators, competitors, and pathogens. UV  radiation also contributes to the formation of microplastic pollutants and  interacts with artificial sunscreens and other pollutants with adverse effects on  aquatic ecosystems. Exposure to UV-B radiation can decrease the toxicity of some  pollutants such as methyl mercury (due to its role in demethylation) but increase  the toxicity of other pollutants such as some pesticides and polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons. Feeding on microplastics by zooplankton can lead to bioaccumulation  in fish. Microplastics are found in up to 20% of fish marketed for human  consumption, potentially threatening food security. Depletion of stratospheric  ozone has altered climate in the southern hemisphere in ways that have increased  oceanic productivity and consequently the growth, survival and reproduction of  many sea birds and mammals. In contrast, warmer sea surface temperatures related  to these climate shifts are also correlated with declines in both kelp beds in  Tasmania and corals in Brazil. This assessment demonstrates that knowledge of the  interactive effects of ozone depletion, UV radiation, and climate change factors  on aquatic ecosystems has advanced considerably over the past four years and  confirms the importance of considering synergies between environmental factors.",01/03/2019,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,717-746,,3,18,,Photochem Photobiol Sci,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 30810561,,,,"Animals; Ecosystem; Aquaculture; Fishes/physiology; *Climate Change; Oceans and Seas; *Adaptation, Biological; *Ozone Depletion; *Ultraviolet Rays/adverse effects; Aquatic Organisms/*physiology/radiation effects; Environmental Pollution/adverse effects/analysis; Fresh Water/analysis; Ice Cover/chemistry; Photosynthesis; Stratospheric Ozone/analysis; Zooplankton/physiology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tissue  distribution of P-gps suggests their role in the organismal defense against  xenobiotics by effecting xenobiotic excretion and reducing xenobiotic uptake. In  the present work, the interaction of P-gp(s) in the liver and in primary cultured  hepatocytes of rainbow trout with two model pollutants was studied - the  imidazole fungicide prochloraz and the alkylphenolic surfactant nonylphenol  diethoxylate (NP2EO). Using a monoclonal antibody (mAB C219) directed against a  conserved P-gp epitope, an immunoreactive protein of 160 kDa was detected in  immunoblots of liver extracts from control trout. In sections of control trout  livers, immunohistochemistry with the mAB C219 resulted in specific staining of  bile canaliculi. In juvenile trout exposed for 7 days to sublethal concentrations  of prochloraz (0.027 microM; 0.27 microM) or NP2EO (0.32 microM; 1.30 microM), no  changes in levels of hepatic P-gp(s) were found in immunoblot and immunochemical  investigations. The efflux of the fluorescent mdr 1 substrate rhodamine 123  (Rh123) from cultured isolated trout hepatocytes was partly inhibited by  verapamil and vinblastine, compounds known to interfere with mdr 1-dependent  transport. This demonstrates the presence of a mdr1-like mechanism in trout liver  which is probably involved in the biliary excretion of hydrophobic xenobiotics.  Non-cytotoxic concentrations of prochloraz and NP2EO were tested for effects on  the efflux of Rh123 from trout hepatocytes. Prochloraz was a potent inhibitor of  the mdr1-like mechanism, being effective at 0.3 microM and above. NP2EO inhibited  Rh123 efflux only at the highest concentration tested (31.6 microM). The  accumulation and elimination of 14C-prochloraz by cultured trout hepatocytes was  not affected by mdr 1-type substrates (Rh123, vinblastine) and a mdr 1 inhibitor  (verapamil). This shows that prochloraz is, despite its inhibitory potency, not a  substrate of the mdr1-like mechanism in trout liver. The inhibition by prochloraz  and NP2EO of the md r1-like mechanism in trout hepatocytes suggests that water  pollutants can interfere with P-gp-function in fish and thus may impair the  organismal defense against xenobiotics.",2001-08,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,215-228,,03-Apr,53,,Aquat Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Netherlands PMID: 11408081,,,,"Male; Animals; Female; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Cells, Cultured; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology; Hepatocytes/chemistry/drug effects; Imidazoles/metabolism/*toxicity; Immunohistochemistry; Liver/chemistry/*drug effects; Phenols/*toxicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our paper had the objective of providing a pooled effect size of suicide for this  occupational group. Suicide is a crucial issue in public and occupational health.  Suicide has a multifactorial etiology and recent systematic reviews and  meta-analyses have pointed out the role of occupational exposures, mainly  psychosocial work stressors, as risk factors for suicide (3, 4). Suicide is a  very rare event in the general population and still more seldom in the working  population. Indeed, unemployed and economically inactive people have a higher  risk of suicide compared to employed people (5, 6). However, the total number of  suicides is greater in the employed population than among the economically  inactive or unemployed (6). Shiri's letter (1) questioned several aspects of our  review and meta-analysis. One comment related to the single reference database  used in our review and a suggestion that our review could not be considered to be  systematic. The review was based on Medline because our main interest was in  quantitative epidemiologic studies. This is the largest database for biomedical  literature and we would argue the most pertinent. Furthermore, we checked the  reference lists of the most recent papers and literature reviews, and Shiri did  not report any paper that was missing. No review, whether searching one or more  databases, can expect to be totally exhaustive. There may always be missing  studies, especially if we consider grey literature. Thus we assert that our  review was systematic, while acknowledging that it may not be perfectly  comprehensive. Shiri suggested an absence of quality assessment of the studies  included in our meta-analysis. First, quality was considered in the context of  our comments in the discussion section. Second, as suggested by Rothman et al  (7), quality assessment was replaced by regression analyses of the effect of each  quality item (study characteristics, ie, study design, effect measure, reference  group, and adjustment). Third, because most studies included in this review were  based on objective data (census, administrative, or register data), they were  free of many of the sources of bias that exist in studies where information on  exposure and outcome must be collected from participants. Consequently, many of  the items related to quality were not pertinent, such as response and follow-up  rates, coverage and representativeness of the sample, selection, etc. Contrary to  what Shiri suggested, all study designs can be informative in this topic because  all of them are able to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect size. In  addition, the prospective and case-control studies may have shortcomings. For  example, we excluded five studies including three prospective and case-control  studies in the sensibility analysis because the group of interest was defined on  the basis of the exposure to chemicals (pesticides) rather than job title. Our  choice to retain the least adjusted models was justified because aggregated data  were used for the meta-analysis. Therefore, unless all included studies adjusted  for the same covariates measured in the same way, adjusted estimates cannot be  meaningfully provided in an aggregate data meta-analysis. In addition, as the  objective was above all descriptive and not etiological or explanatory, and as it  is the norm in the exploration of social inequalities in health (8), the results  from the least (gender- and age-) adjusted models were in line with the  objective. Indeed, including more adjustment variables could lead to  overadjustment as they may be intermediate variables on the causal pathways  between occupation and suicide. Our strategy was in line with previous  meta-analyses on similar topics (9-11). Consequently, we would argue that our  results are not likely to be largely due to confounding, contrary to the comment  by Shiri. Indeed, the study of the contribution of underlying factors in  explaining social inequalities in health outcomes is a fully-fledged topic of  research (12-15), but this is relevant research to conduct after demonstrating  that inequalities exist between social or occupational groups. Several of Shiri's  comments were about statistical aspects of our analyses. First, it was suggested  that we did not correctly extract the confidence intervals for the estimates of  several studies. We disagree. We used the STATA metan suite of commands using  log-transformed effect sizes and standard errors. Our figure 1 and the values of  effect sizes and confidence intervals were provided by STATA, this explains why  there may be small differences in these values compared with the results  published in some studies. Using log-transformed effect sizes and confidence  intervals, the analysis provided the same results. Second, our subgroup  comparison was based on subsamples that were independent. As not all studies  provided information for these subgroups, each subgroup was treated as a unit of  analysis. This strategy allows the use of all relevant subgroups and comparisons  between them (16). Third, we were also criticized for the use of random-effects  models. Random-effects models are generally more plausible for meta-analysis  based on studies from the published literature, because the fixed-effect model  assumed that the entire corpus of literature has been obtained, ie, that every  study has been or ever will be written on the topic has been included, which is  an implausible assumption. We also assumed differences in effect size between  studies and between subgroups, and the use of random-effects models was  consistent with such an assumption. However, random-effects models produce wider  confidence intervals compared to fixed-effect models (16). These models are thus  more conservative, making our results all the more robust. One of Shiri's  comments related to the reference group used in the studies for the comparison of  agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers. Although we reported that the  studies using a specific occupational group as reference group provided a higher  effect size than the studies using other reference groups, we did not explicitly  recognize and state in the paper that the results for Japan were based on two  studies using a specific occupational group as reference; we concede that this  may explain why we found a much more elevated effect size for Japan. Shiri's  results (1) allow to conclude that the difference between Japan and the other  geographic areas could be explained by the choice of reference group-we are  grateful to him for raising this point. However, we would note that the effect  size of suicide was still elevated and significant for agricultural, forestry,  and fishery workers even after this change in the reference group for these two  studies. Nevertheless, the choice of the optimal reference group is not obvious.  If we consider the general population as the reference group, as unemployed  people and economically inactive people (including people who may not be working  due to illness or disability) are part of it and have a higher risk of suicide  than employed people, the effect size provided by the nine studies using the  general population as the reference is likely to be underestimated, which may  contribute to an underestimation of the observed effect size of suicide among  agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers in our study. The comparison was made  in our paper with the other occupational groups (ie, the working population  except the group of interest) as the reference, which was used by nine other  studies, but this did not allow to determine the exact rank of the group of  interest in the occupational hierarchy. Another relevant choice would have been  to retain the group with the lowest suicide risk (for example, the high-skilled  occupational group) as the reference, which would have led to a much higher  effect size of suicide for agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers. To  conclude, as statistical power in detecting differences between subgroups may be  low in subgroup analyses and meta-regression, the absence of significant results  according to subgroups found in our results cannot be interpreted as evidence  that the effect size is the same across subgroups. Consequently, our  meta-analysis reporting a significant excess of risk of suicide among  agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers may also be a good incentive for more  research among this group of workers to (i) confirm this observed excess of risk  using differing methodological approaches to meta-analysis and (ii) explore the  potential differences within this group and the underlying factors that may  explain this excess of risk.

This article describes the context, methods, limitations and findings of the  Northway Wild Food and Health Project (NWFHP). OBJECTIVE: The NWFHP comprised 2  pilot studies: the Northway Wild Food Study (NWFS), which investigated  contaminants in locally prioritized traditional foods over time, and the Northway  Health Study (NHS), which investigated locally suspected links between resource  uses and health problems. DESIGN: This research employed mixed methods. The NWFS  reviewed remedial documents and existing data. The NHS collected household  information regarding resource uses and health conditions by questionnaire and  interview. NHS data represent general (yes or no) personal knowledge that was  often second hand. Retrospective cohort comparisons were made of the reported  prevalence of 7 general health problems between groups based on their reported  (yes or no) consumption of particular resources, for 3 data sets (existing,  historic and combined) with a two-tailed Fisher's Exact Test in SAS (n = 325  individuals in 83 households, 24 of which no longer exist). RESULTS: The NWFS  identified historic pathways of exposure to petroleum, pesticides, herbicides,  chlorinated byproducts of disinfection and lead from resources that were consumed  more frequently decades ago and are not retrospectively quantifiable. The NHS  found complex patterns of association between reported resource uses and cancer  and thyroid-, reproductive-, metabolic- and cardiac problems. CONCLUSION: Lack of  detail regarding medical conditions, undocumented histories of exposure, time  lapsed since the release of pollution and changes to health and health care over  the same period make this exploratory research. Rather than demonstrate  causation, these results document the legitimacy of local suspicions and warrant  additional investigation.

Compared to the gill structure of the control fish, all the diazinon  concentrations caused various types of changes, such as lifting of the epithelial  layer, hyperplasia and necrosis, shortening of the lamellae and frequent  epithelial rupture, lamellar fusion, severe hyperplasia and mucous cells  hypertrophy, extensive fusion, and clavate lamellae. Some of the structural  changes may serve as a defense mechanism in protecting the fish from the  diazinon-contaminated water by increasing the diffusion distance. Increase in the  diffusion distance and mucus secretion can adversely affect the respiration of  the fish, ultimately leading to its death.",1993-12,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,219-227,,4,12,,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 8189379,,,,Animals; Necrosis; Gills/*drug effects/pathology; Diazinon/*toxicity; *Perciformes; Hyperplasia/chemically induced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On entering aquatic  habitats, these chemicals target and disrupt both physiological and behavioral  functioning in various aquatic organisms. Herbicides, such as  2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), can have negative impacts on  chemoreception because these receptor cells are in direct contact with  water-soluble chemicals in the environment. Studies focusing on lethal  concentration (LC50) levels may understate the impact of herbicides within  aquatic habitats because damage to the chemoreceptors can result in modified  behaviors or lack of appropriate responses to environmental or social cues. The  purpose of this experiment was to determine whether exposure to sublethal levels  of 2,4-D alters the foraging behaviors of crayfish Orconectes rusticus. We  hypothesized that crayfish exposed to greater concentrations of 2,4-D would be  less successful in locating food or on locating food would consume smaller  amounts possibly due to an inability to recognize the food odors in the  contaminated waters. Crayfish were exposed to three sublethal levels of 2,4-D for  96 h and placed into a Y-maze system with a fish gelatin food source placed  randomly in the right or left arm. Average walking speed, average time spent in  the correct arm, and percent consumption were analyzed. Our data show that  crayfish were impaired in their ability to forage effectively. These inabilities  to locate and consume adequate amounts of food could result in lower body weights  and decreased fitness in populations of crayfish exposed to 2,4-D in natural  habitats.",2014-08,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,234-244,,2,67,,Arch Environ Contam Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 24799048,,,,"Animals; Ecosystem; Herbicides/*toxicity; Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity; Feeding Behavior/*drug effects; 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid/*toxicity; Astacoidea/drug effects/*physiology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, to develop a quantitative assessment  parameter for spatial distribution, the zebrafish were exposed to ethanol,  pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), paraquat dichloride (paraquat) and wastewater, followed  by a behavioral test in a narrow tank. Behavioral data was acquired and analyzed  by idTracker and MATLAB. By comparing the effects of all treatments on behavior  parameters, we confirmed that the spatial distribution was more easily altered  rather than general locomotor parameters, e.g. 0.7-70 mg/L PTZ and 5-20 mg/L  paraquat being effective for altering spatial distribution but having little  effects on general locomotor parameters. Based on the heatmap, i.e., the  cumulative proportion of grids and that of frequency in grids, we calculated the  behavioral Gini coefficient (G(b)) for quantitative assessment of fish spatial  distribution. The Gini coefficient ranged from zero to 1, with larger values  meaning poorer evenness of spatial distribution. Of note, G(b) showed smaller  coefficient of variations (CV) with 3%-19% between replicate tanks in all  treatments than the highest frequency (4%-79%), displaying well robustness.  Especially, G(b) addressed the challenge of the complicated heatmap with multiple  hotspots.

In this study we tested the impact of water salinity,  egg density and infection potential of the environment on egg viability in the  sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus), a small fish that exhibits paternal egg care  and has a marine origin, but which in the Baltic Sea lives in brackish water. To  manipulate the infection potential of the environment, we added either a  Saprolegnia infection vector into UV-filtered water or a fungicide into natural  Baltic Sea water. Saprolegnia are widely spread water moulds that are a key cause  of egg mortality in aquatic organisms in fresh- and brackish water. We found that  increased water salinity indeed decreased the egg infection rate and had a  positive effect on egg viability, while high egg density tended to have the  opposite effect. However, the different factors influenced egg viability  interactively, with a higher egg density having negative effects at low, but not  in high, salinity. Thus, the challenges facing marine organisms adapting to lower  salinity levels can be amplified by Saprolegnia infections that reduce egg  survival in interaction with other environmental factors. Our results support the  hypothesis that suppressing egg infections is an important aspect of parental  care that can select for filial cannibalism, a common but poorly understood  behaviour, especially in fish with parental care.",2015-07,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,673-683,,3,178,,Oecologia,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Germany PMID: 25676104,,,,"Animals; *Cannibalism; *Salinity; Fungicides, Industrial/pharmacology; Ovum/drug effects/growth & development/*physiology; Perciformes/embryology/microbiology/*physiology; Saprolegnia/drug effects/physiology; Seawater/*chemistry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this study, Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were exposed  subchronically to the organophosphate pesticide malathion in a series of two  experiments. In the first set of studies, fish were exposed for 7 or 14 d to  untreated well water (i.e., controls) or to waterborne malathion at 0.2 or 0.8  mg/L. Following exposure, fish from each group were sacrificed and their kidneys  (primary organ of leukopoiesis in fish and equivalent to mammalian bone marrow)  were used to provide cells for assessing any malathion-induced effects upon  nonspecific and acquired immune defense mechanisms. Effects upon humoral-mediated  immunity were determined by enumerating antibody plaque-forming cell (PFC)  numbers from a subset of fish exposed to malathion for 14 d and then injected  intraperitoneally (ip) with sheep erythrocytes (sRBC). Results of these studies  demonstrated that while malathion exposure had no significant effect upon  hematocrit/leukocrit values or upon mitogen-stimulated T-cell  lymphoproliferation, PFC numbers in the kidney of exposed fish were significantly  reduced (compared to control fish) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, total  recoverable kidney cell numbers and viability, as well as superoxide anion  production by kidney phagocytes, were reduced slightly (compared to control  values) in fish exposed for 14 d to the highest malathion concentration tested.  In the second set of experiments, medaka exposed for up to 21 d to either 0.1 or  0.3 mg malathion/L were challenged ip with an LD50 dose of the bacterial fish  pathogen Yersinia ruckeri. Results from these infectivity studies demonstrated  that exposure to either malathion concentration, for 14 or 21 d reduced host  resistance against Yersinia infection. Taken together, these findings demonstrate  the applicability of mammalian immune assays for predicting malathion-induced  immunosuppression in a teleost fish, as well as the potential utility of a small  laboratory fish to serve as an alternate model for mammals in immunotoxicological  studies.",23/04/1999,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,523-542,,8,56,,J Toxicol Environ Health A,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 10321383,,,,Animals; Predictive Value of Tests; Insecticides/*toxicity; Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism; Cholinesterase Inhibitors/*toxicity; Malathion/*toxicity; Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects; Antibody Formation/drug effects/immunology; Immunoassay/methods; Kidney/cytology/drug effects/immunology; Oryzias/*immunology; Phagocytes/drug effects/metabolism; T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Occupational  and environmental exposures were studied in several countries and found to play  important role in the disease development. However, in Egypt, a little attention  has been paid to study the effect of these factors in the disease development.  OBJECTIVE: To identify the occupational and environmental risk factors associated  with the development of IPF in Egypt. METHODS: A multicenter hospital-based  case-control study was carried out in chest hospitals affiliated to three  Egyptian cities-Cairo, Tanta and Mansoura. Subjects were 201 patients with  confirmed IPF (cases) and 205 age-, sex- and residence-matched controls. Data on  occupational and environmental factors were obtained from a questionnaire.  Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent risk  factors of IPF in both sexes for single factors with adjustment for age,  residence and smoking status. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the risk of  IPF in male workers was observed to increase significantly in chemical and  petrochemical industries and carpentry and wood working (OR = 2.56, 95% CI:  1.02-7.01), and with occupational exposures to wood dust and wood preservatives.  Among female workers, a significant increase was observed in farming (OR = 3.34,  95% CI: 1.17-10.12), raising birds and occupational exposures to animal feeds,  products and dusts and pesticides. Risk of IPF decreased significantly in male  workers and insignificantly among female workers in sales and clerical related  activities. The environmental exposures to birds and cats were significantly  associated with elevated risk of IPF development in both sexes. CONCLUSION: In  Egypt, farming, raising birds and wood working are important risk factors for the  development of IPF.",2012-07,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,107-116,,3,3,,Int J Occup Environ Med,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Iran PMID: 23022860,,,,Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Risk Factors; Occupational Exposure; Egypt/epidemiology; Agricultural Workers' Diseases/epidemiology; Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis/*epidemiology; Wood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional methods for  detection of fungicide resistance are time-consuming, which are routinely based  on tedious operation, reliance on expensive equipment, and specially trained  people. Therefore, it is important to establish efficient methods for field  detection of benzimidazole resistance in V. carpophila to make suitable  management strategies and ensure food safety. Based on recombinase polymerase  amplification (RPA) combined with CRISPR/Cas12a, a rapid one-pot assay  ORCas12a-BRVc (one-pot RPA-CRISPR/Cas12 platform) was established for the  detection of benzimidazole resistance in V. carpophila. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay  enabled one-pot detection by adding components at the bottom and wall of the tube  separately, solving the problems of aerosol contamination and decreased  sensitivity caused by competing DNA substrates between Cas12a cleavage and RPA  amplification. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay could accomplish the detection with a  minimum of 7.82 × 10(3) fg μL(-1) V. carpophila genomic DNA in 45 min at 37 °C.  Meanwhile, this assay showed excellent specificity due to the specific  recognition ability of the Cas12a-crRNA complex. Further, we combined a method  that could rapidly extract DNA from V. carpophila within 2 min with the  ORCas12a-BRVc to achieve more rapid and simple detection of V. carpophila with  benzimidazole resistance in fields. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay has the advantages of  simplicity, rapidity, high sensitivity, high specificity, and ease of operation  without the need for precision instruments and the need to isolate and culture  pathogens. This assay is the first application of the one-pot platform based on  the combination of RPA and CRISPR/Cas12a in fungicide resistance detection and  can be used for monitoring of resistant populations in fields, providing guidance  on making suitable management strategies for peach scab.",25/01/2023,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,1381-1390,,3,71,,J Agric Food Chem,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 36624936,,,,"Humans; *Fungicides, Industrial; *Recombinases; Benzimidazoles/pharmacology; CRISPR-Cas Systems; CRISPR/Cas12a; fungicide resistance; MBC fungicides; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Nucleotidyltransferases; one-pot detection; RPA; Venturia carpophila",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Early developmental stages of fish, from embryo to larvae,  were exposed to terbuthylazine at concentrations of 0.9, 160, 520, and 820 μg/L,  and metribuzin at concentrations of 0.9, 4, 14, and 32 mg/L for 30 days and  compared to the non-treated control group. For assessment of free radical defence  the activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR)  were measured; the lipid peroxidation (TBARS) level was determined as a marker of  free radical damage. RESULTS: Terbuthylazine had no significant effect (p>0.05)  at any tested concentrations on GST activity. Terbuthylazine caused an increase  (p<0.05) in GR activity at the concentration of 520 μg/L. We found a  non-significant (p>0.05) effect of terbuthylazine exposure on TBARS level. In  metribuzin treated groups, the activity of GST was increased (p<0.05) in all  experimental groups, with the highest at the concentration of 32 mg/L. GR  activity was increased in the 0.9, 4, and 14 mg/L groups and the TBARS levels  were the highest in the 0.9 mg/L group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that  terbuthylazine and metribuzin induced oxidative stress in embryo-larval stages of  common carp.

A total of 321 houses of 18 villages  were surveyed on use of indoor residual spray (IRS) and insecticide-treated bed  nets (ITN) and other activities as tool for vector control and interrupting the  transmission of malaria. Out of 690 living rooms and 343 verandahs examined, IRS  with Dichlorodiphenyl-trichloro-ethane (DDT) was done only in 16.23% living rooms  and 64.72% verandahs. Refusal rate of IRS in living rooms was 81.93% due to lack  of knowledge regarding the importance of IRS, no prior information to villagers,  houses locked, reluctance to remove domestic articles, dislike of smell of DDT  spray. Compliance rate of ITN uses was 71.66% during the night, which might be a  factor for decline in malaria cases in the study area.

METHODS: Information on time to pregnancy, subfertility,  and infertility was collected retrospectively by self-administered questionnaires  in 2 cohorts of fishermen's wives from the Swedish east (by the Baltic Sea) and  west coasts. In addition to cohort affiliation, current fish consumption and  growing up in a fishing village were used as proxies for exposure within the  eastcoast cohort. RESULTS: A decreased success (ie, pregnancy) rate and a  tendency towards increased subfertility was found for heavy smokers (> or =10  cigarettes/day) in the eastcoast cohort as compared with the westcoast cohort  [success rate ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.49-.89; subfertility  odds ratio 1.64, 95% CI 0.91-2.91).

To defend host-generated oxidants, Salmonella encodes primary antioxidants and protein  repair enzymes. Methionine (Met) residues are highly prone to oxidation and  convert into methionine sulfoxide (Met-SO) which compromises protein functions  and subsequently cellular survival. However, by reducing Met-SO to Met,  methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs) enhance cellular survival under stress  conditions. Salmonella encodes five Msrs which are specific for particular Met-SO  (free/protein bound), and 'R'/'S' types. Earlier studies assessed the effect of  deletions of one or two msrs on the stress physiology of S. Typhimurium. We  generated a pan msr gene deletion (Δ5msr) strain in S. Typhimurium. The Δ5msr  mutant strain shows an initial lag in in vitro growth. However, the Δ5msr mutant  strain depicts very high sensitivity (p < 0.0001) to hypochlorous acid (HOCl),  chloramine T (ChT) and superoxide-generating oxidant paraquat. Further, the Δ5msr  mutant strain shows high levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls, and  protein aggregation. On the other side, the Δ5msr mutant strain exhibits lower  levels of free amines. Further, the Δ5msr mutant strain is highly susceptible to  neutrophils and shows defective fitness in the spleen and liver of mice.

In the present work, we studied the main genes related to  efflux transporters in zebrafish liver (ZFL) cells exposed to MP with and without  an inhibitor of ABC transporters (verapamil). The results concerning transporters  activity showed that the MXR mechanism is activated to detoxify from methyl  parathion. The toxic effects of MP on ZFL cells were increased in the presence of  the efflux transporter inhibitor, once cell viability was significantly decreased  in co-exposure experiments. The combined exposure to MP and the inhibitor caused  an increase in gene expression of P-gp1 (Abcb1) and MRP4 (Abcc4), suggesting that  these transporters isoforms are associated with MP efflux.

The present study aimed to  evaluate the effects of Tattoo on goldfish gills and blood, tissues that would  have close early contact with the pollutant. Exposure of goldfish Carassius  auratus to 3, 5 or 10mgL(-1) of Tattoo for 96h resulted in moderate lymphopenia  (by 8 percent) with a concomitant increase in both stab (by 66-88 percent) and  segmented (by 166 percent) neutrophils. An increase in the content of protein  carbonyl groups in blood (by 137-184 percent) together with decreased levels of  protein thiols (by 23 percent) and an enhancement of lipid peroxide  concentrations (by 29 percent) in gills after exposure to 10mgL(-1) of Tattoo  demonstrated the induction of mild oxidative stress in response to Tattoo  exposure. At the same time, the activities of selected antioxidant enzymes were  enhanced in gills: superoxide dismutase by 18-25 percent and catalase by 27  percent. A 34 percent increment in low molecular mass thiol concentrations  (mainly represented by glutathione) also occurred in gills and could be related  to increased activity (by 13-30 percent) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.  The results indicate that Tattoo exposure perturbs free radical processes, i.e.  induces mild oxidative stress and enhances the activity of certain antioxidant  and associated enzymes in goldfish gills.

Juvenile Senegalese soles were  exposed for 14 days in the laboratory and in situ (field) to sediments from three  sites (a reference plus two contaminated) of a Portuguese estuary. Sediment  characterization confirmed the combination of metals, polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons and organochlorines in the two contaminated sediments. Changes in  liver cytosolic protein regulation patterns were determined by a combination of  two-dimensional electrophoresis with de novo sequencing by tandem mass  spectrometry. From the forty-one cytosolic proteins found to be deregulated,  nineteen were able to be identified, taking part in multiple cellular processes  such as anti-oxidative defence, energy production, proteolysis and contaminant  catabolism (especially oxidoreductase enzymes). Besides a clear distinction  between animals exposed to the reference and contaminated sediments, differences  were also observed between laboratory- and in situ-tested fish.

In situ  exposure to the contaminated sediments revealed significant up-regulation of  basal metabolism-related enzymes, comparatively to the reference condition.

The TEP  values of several (CO)3Ni-NHC-X systems with five different ditopic NHC ligand  systems [triazolyldiylidene (A), bis(imidazolylidene) (B),  benzobis(imidazolylidene) (C), cyclopenta[f,g]acenaphthylenebis(imidazolylidene)  (D) and bis(imidazolidinylidene) (F)] were determined by means of DFT  calculations.

In our previous study, L-buthionine  sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, caused uncoupling of  horizontal cells four days after injection. In the present study, we have used  paraquat, a generator of exogenous reactive oxygen species, to investigate  whether it was the depletion of glutathione or an increase in the level of  reactive oxygen species which resulted in horizontal cell uncoupling after  L-buthionine sulfoximine injection. Intracellular recordings were made from  L-type horizontal cells at various time-points after intravitreal injection of  paraquat. Injection of 25nmol paraquat caused an increase in response amplitude  to central spot light stimuli by two days after injection, which continued for a  further two to three days and had almost disappeared by seven days after  injection. There was also a sharp increase in reactive oxygen species production,  peaking at four days and disappearing by seven days after injection, and an  accompanying depletion and a restoration of glutathione levels with a similar  time-course. Marking cells with Lucifer Yellow clearly illustrated uncoupling of  horizontal cells after paraquat injection. If paraquat and L-buthionine  sulfoximine were injected simultaneously, the increase in response to central  spots was observed as early as one day after injection. This response amplitude  was not more enhanced than that observed after L-buthionine sulfoximine injection  alone, although a dramatic increase in the level of reactive oxygen species was  observed. From these results, we suggest that reactive oxygen species are  involved in uncoupling, while recovery from uncoupling is dependent on  glutathione. Furthermore, we conclude that a balance between glutathione and  reactive oxygen species levels is the most important factor controlling gap  junctional intercellular communication of L-type horizontal cells in the carp  retina.",2001,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,959-967,,4,102,,Neuroscience,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 11182257,,,,"Animals; Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Herbicides/pharmacology; Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology; Photic Stimulation; Carps; Glutathione/*metabolism; Paraquat/pharmacology; Cell Communication/physiology; Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacokinetics; Gap Junctions/*metabolism; Isoquinolines/pharmacokinetics; Retina/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A self-completed  questionnaire was mailed to 536 family physicians with hospital affiliations in  three areas of Ontario. SETTING: Family practices (rural, small urban, and large  urban) in Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Of 521 eligible community family physicians with  hospital affiliations, 214 returned usable questionnaires for a 41% response  rate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Environmental health problems encountered in  practice were measured using questions about physician concerns, reported patient  questions, physician-identified high-risk groups, problems related to  environmental exposure, self-rated knowledge, and current and preferred sources  of information on environmental health effects. RESULTS: Physicians were highly  concerned and reported many patient questions about the health effects of  environmental exposures. Pregnant women, agricultural workers, and children were  considered important at-risk groups. Self-ratings of knowledge were generally  very low. Rural physicians were concerned about agricultural pesticide exposure  and their patients about moldy hay. Urban physicians had different concerns about  lead and reported patient concerns about exposure to Great Lakes fish. All groups  used similar sources of current environmental health information.

The gills of the fish are the  primary corridor formolecularexchange between the internal milieu of a fish and  its environment. Gills perform numerous functions such as oxygen uptake and CO2  excretion, osmoregulation, acid-basic balance, excretion of nitrogenous compounds  and taste. Hazardous chemicals present in water may alter the morphology of the  epithelial cells of gills of the fish, which may affect the process of diffusion  of gases and ultimately the overall health of the fish. To prove this fact  Cyprinus carpio communis Linn. was kept in water for 30 days having low  concentration of 0.038 ppm (1\10th of LC50) of monocrotophos and an attempt was  made to study the different types of degenerations produced in the epithelial  cells of gills as compared to the normal epithelial cells of gills of this  culturable fish using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) technique. The  ultrastructural changes due to the toxic exposure at finer scale were thinning of  microridges, upliftment of epithelial cells, development of hyperplasia, decrease  in the density of mucous cells which are considered to be the first line of  defence and total dystrophy of epithelial tissue. Thus, it is opined that a low  concentration of monocrotophos has the potential to bring different type of  degenerations at finer scale hence affecting the fish's health drastically and  altering the fitness of the fish in water even having insignificant amount of  this toxicant in the ambient water",2007-07,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,663-667,,3,28,,J Environ Biol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: India PMID: 18380092,,,,"Animals; Insecticides/*toxicity; Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; *Carps; Epithelial Cells/*drug effects/pathology/ultrastructure; Gills/*drug effects/pathology/ultrastructure; Monocrotophos/*toxicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In predator-prey interactions,  mediation signals allow prey to detect their predators and can be crucial in the  process of avoiding them. Since organisms in many natural waterbodies are often  subjected to anthropogenic stressors, it is hypothesised that low concentrations  of xenobiotic compounds can disturb this chemical communication, acting as  infodisruptors. This study analyzes whether two anthropogenic pollutants  (chromium and an insecticide) interfere in two freshwater predator-prey  interactions, by altering the behavioural responses of a cladoceran and a copepod  species to a fish chemical cue. The concentrations tested were lower than those  considered innocuous under international water quality guidelines, and two types  of behaviour were analysed: escape ability and depth selection in an artificial  water column. Both species tested demonstrated a higher escape ability when  exposed to the cue than when they were not exposed. Xenobiotics modified the  responses of the copepod in opposite ways: chromium inhibited this behaviour and  the insecticide prompted a higher than expected level of escape ability. The  depth selection patterns were different between N. conifer and C. dubia. Fish  kairomones did not modify them, however chromium and the insecticide caused  important alterations in both cases. Such disruptions would be detrimental to the  organisms' life cycle trajectories, which, in natural systems, would cause  longterm damage in trophic structure and in evolutionary processes.",2012-07,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,Nov-16,,,81,,Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Phenotypically similar to E. tarda, extensive genetic and phenotypic  characterization determined this new strain does not belong to any established  Edwardsiella taxa, leading to the adoption of a new taxon, E. piscicida.  Concurrent research in the USA also identified 2 genetically distinct taxa within  the group of organisms traditionally classified as E. tarda. Comparisons of gyrB  sequences between US isolates and E. piscicida from Europe and Asia identified  several US isolates with >99.6% similarity to the gyrB sequence of the E.  piscicida type strain (ET883) but <87% similarity to the E. tarda type strain  (ATCC #15947). A discriminatory PCR was developed for the identification of E.  tarda and 2 genetic variants of E. piscicida (E. piscicida and E. piscicida-like  species).

J.; Taylor, P.",Onchidal: a naturally occurring irreversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase with a novel mechanism of action.,Molecular pharmacology,,0026-895X,,,"Onchidal has been identified as the major lipid-soluble component of the defensive secretion of the mollusc Onchidella binneyi, and it has been proposed  as the compound responsible for the chemical protection of Onchidella [Bioorg.  Chem. 7:125-131 (1978)]. In support of this hypothesis, we now report that  onchidal can be found in several different species of Onchidella and that it is  toxic to fish. Because onchidal is an acetate ester similar to acetylcholine, its  ability to interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and  acetylcholinesterase was investigated. Although onchidal did not prevent the  binding of 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, it  inhibited acetylcholinesterase in a progressive, apparently irreversible, manner.  The apparent affinity of onchidal for the initial reversible binding to  acetylcholinesterase (Kd) was approximately 300 microM, and the apparent rate  constant for the subsequent irreversible inhibition of enzyme activity (kintact)  was approximately 0.1 min-1. Onchidal was a substrate for acetylcholinesterase,  and approximately 3250 mol of onchidal were hydrolyzed/mol of enzyme irreversibly  inhibited. The calculated kcat for onchidal was 325 min-1. Irreversible  inhibition resulted from either onchidal itself or a reactive intermediate in the  enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of onchidal, rather than from the hydrolysis products  of onchidal. Irreversible inhibition of enzyme activity was prevented by  coincubation with reversible agents that either sterically block (edrophonium and  decamethonium) or allosterically modify (propidium) the acetylcholine binding  site. Enzyme activity was not regenerated by incubation with oxime reactivators;  therefore, the mechanism of irreversible inhibition does not appear to involve  acylation of the active site serine. Because onchidal contains a potentially  reactive alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, irreversible inhibition of  acetylcholinesterase may result from formation of a novel covalent bond between  the toxin and the enzyme. Thus, this novel toxin could potentially be exploited  in the design of a new class of anticholinesterase insecticides and in the  identification of amino acids that contribute to the binding and hydrolysis of  acetylcholine.",1989-09,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,349-354,,3,36,,Mol Pharmacol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 2779521,,,,"Animals; Acetylcholinesterase/*metabolism; Binding Sites; Structure-Activity Relationship; *Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Kinetics; Mollusca/analysis; Mollusk Venoms/analysis/metabolism/*pharmacology; Oximes; Pyridinium Compounds/pharmacology; Receptors, Nicotinic/drug effects; Terpenes/metabolism/*pharmacology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Questionnaire-based protocol prepared by the National  Vector Borne Disease Control Programme was used to evaluate the activities.  Sixteen villages belonging to five different Primary Health Centres (PHCs) of  three districts were selected for investigations. RESULTS: Results of monitoring  of indoor residual spraying (IRS) revealed inadequate spraying coverage. Although  recorded to be about 69-99%, but apparently it was 17-43% in the districts  investigated. Cross-examination of 180 blood smears (90 positive and negative  each) in the laboratories of the study PHCs, revealed discrepancy in the results  of 67 blood smears. Maximum (44%) discrepancy was observed in positive blood  smears and 30% in negative blood smears. Out of 22 Accredited Social Health  Activists (ASHA) interrogated, none was found involved in antimalaria activities.  However, out of 13 fever treatment depots monitored, one was found partially  functional. Criteria laid down for preparation of micro action plan were not  followed properly in any of the districts sruveyed. Various important components  of the programme like constitution of Village Health Sanitation Committee,  information education communication (IEC) activities, capacity building, use of  larvivorous fishes, supervision, etc. were not exercised properly. However, 100%  community acceptance was recorded for insecticide-treated bed nets in the  villages surveyed. Indiscriminate use of rapid diagnostic test kits yielded poor  and unsatisfactory response. Declining trend of malaria was observed during  2002-06 in Districts Nagaon and Karbi-Anglong (up to 2005). In District Cachar,  however, a little increasing trend was observed during 2002-04. CONCLUSION: The  results of this investigation revealed that the malaria control programme had  been jeopardized seriously due to improper implementation of vector control  measures, lack of adequate professional support and varied commitment on the part  of the State Government. It can be concluded that long-term malaria control  strategy should be based on generation of increased awareness on the disease and  various methods of its control, health care access and administrative commitment  for increased prosperity in resource-poor settings. The observation also  necessitates further in-depth evaluation with appropriate regular active  surveillance round the year with prompt detection and treatment facilities in  order to control malaria effectively in these districts.",2009-12,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,280-287,,4,46,,J Vector Borne Dis,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: India PMID: 19959854,,,,"Humans; India/epidemiology; Malaria/*prevention & control; *Mosquito Control; Reagent Kits, Diagnostic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCB concentrations in bluefish varied  between different locations, and also among fish from a given location. A  generally decreasing gradient in PCB concentrations was evident as the bluefish  were collected away from the Superfund Site. The average sum of PCB  concentrations were highest for bluefish collected in the Upper Harbor between  Interstate-195 Bridge and Coggeshall Street Bridge (Upper Harbor), followed by  bluefish in Lower Harbor from north of Popes Island Bridge (Lower Harbor), and  bluefish from Outer Harbor south of Hurricane Barrier (Outer Harbor). The levels  of PCBs in bluefish from Clarks Cove and PCBs in bluefish from Buzzards Bay were  similar and lowest among all bluefish specimens analyzed in the present study.  Pesticide concentrations were about one order of magnitude or lower than the PCB  concentrations, and the gradient of pesticide concentrations generally followed  the gradient of PCB concentrations. Some of the commonly detected pesticides in  the order of decreasing concentrations included DDTs and metabolites, heptachlor  epoxide, endosulfan sulfate, and α-chlordane. Distribution of PCBs and  organochlorine pesticides were examined in the tissues of YOY bluefish from  Clarks Cove. PCBs and lipids in the brain samples of YOY bluefish were generally  numerically greater than PCBs in the liver samples, but these differences were  not statistically significant. PCBs and lipids in hypaxial muscle samples were  numerically greater than PCBs in epaxial muscle samples, although these two  groups of tissues were not statistically different. Despite the higher  susceptibility of lighter PCB homologs to geophysical and biogeochemical  weathering processes, the relative dominance of lighter homologs in the Upper  Harbor and Lower Harbor samples suggested ongoing or recent sources of these  lighter PCBs, particularly Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016 in this area. The  presence of heavier homologs in the Upper Harbor and Lower Harbor bluefish  samples could be attributed to Aroclor 1252 and Aroclor 1254 that were being used  in relatively smaller quantities in the manufacture of electrical components in  addition to Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016. The concentration of heavier PCB  homologs appears to increase in YOY bluefish the further away from the PCB  Superfund Site in the Acushnet Estuary the samples were collected. Principal  component analyses of PCB 153 normalized concentrations of the individual PCB  congeners resulted in two general groupings; a relatively tight group comprised  of YOY bluefish from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and Outer Harbor, and a rather  loose and more dispersed group comprised of Buzzards Bay bluefish and the tissue  samples of bluefish from Clarks Cove. Principal component analyses of major  pesticides suggested close groupings of bluefish from Clarks Cove and bluefish  from Buzzards Bay. Pesticides in bluefish from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and  Outer Harbor formed a loose group, with some bluefish from these locations  populating close to Clarks Cove and Buzzards Bay bluefish. Although PCBs have  been implicated in various behavioral and health effects in the experimental and  field studies, the deleterious effects of chronic exposure to high concentrations  of PCBs and the potential for recruitment of New Bedford Harbor YOY bluefish  population to the adult stock remains obscure. Adaptive or evolutionary  resistance to contaminants have been documented in resident species in some  highly contaminated estuaries, however similar responses have not been  investigated in the migratory species like bluefish. The results of the present  study provide a reference baseline for YOY bluefish for ""before-and-after""  comparative studies and other toxicological studies for the New Bedford Harbor  Superfund Site that is currently being remediated.",15/07/2013,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,146-164,,1,72,,Mar Pollut Bull,,,,,,,,eng,Published by Elsevier Ltd.,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 23664766,,,,"Animals; *Environmental Monitoring; Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis/*metabolism; Water Pollution, Chemical/statistics & numerical data; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated/analysis/*metabolism; Massachusetts; Perciformes/*metabolism; Pesticides/analysis/*metabolism; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/*metabolism",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cohorts of fishermen's wives from the  Swedish east and west coasts were established and linked to the Swedish Medical  Birth Register for 1973-1991; 1501 children were born in the eastcoast cohort and  3553 in the westcoast cohort. Comparisons were made with regional populations and  between the cohorts. Dietary interviews were made with 69 randomly selected women  from the cohorts and 69 referents. RESULTS: The women interviewed from the east-  and westcoast cohorts ate locally caught fish more than twice as often as their  referents. Compared with the regional population, the women in the eastcoast  cohort gave birth to an increased number of infants with low birthweights (< 3000  g), whereas the opposite was seen in the westcoast cohort.

Unfortunately, economic  expediency and the need for rapid implementation often require that biological  control programs be based more on trial and error than on sound ecological theory  and testing. This approach has led to some remarkable successes but it has also  produced dismal failures. This point is particularly well illustrated in the  historical development and use of entomopathogenic nematodes for the biological  control of insect pests. Intense effort has focused on developing these natural  enemies as alternatives to chemical insecticides, in part because laboratory  assays indicated that these nematodes possess a broad host range. This illusory  attribute launched hundreds of field releases, many of which failed due to  ecological barriers to infection that are not apparent from laboratory exposures,  where conditions are optimal and host-parasite contact assured. For example, the  entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae is a poor choice to control  scarab larvae because this nematode uses an ambusher foraging strategy near the  soil surface whereas the equally sedentary scarab remains within the soil  profile, shows a weak host recognition response to scarabs, has difficulty  overcoming the scarab immune response, and has low reproduction in this host.  Conversely, two other nematodes, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and S. glaseri,  are highly adapted to parasitize scarabs: they use a cruising foraging strategy,  respond strongly to scarabs, easily overcome the immune response, and reproduce  well in these hosts. Increased understanding of the ecology of entomopathogenic  nematodes has enabled better matches between parasites and hosts, and more  accurate predictions of field performance. These results underline the importance  of a strong partnership between basic and applied ecology in the area of  biological control.",1997-02,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,483-489,,4,109,,Oecologia,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Germany PMID: 28307331,,,,Biological control; Host acceptance; Host habitat-finding; Host-finding; Key words Nematode,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In both states the peak  occurrence came in 1976. Malaria was largely confined to highly vulnerable and  receptive areas. The problem of increased incidence was particularly associated  with the development of several irrigation and hydro-electric schemes. Improperly  maintained irrigation systems and reservoirs provided ideal breeding grounds. The  present paper examines the scope and limitations of a major anti-malaria  activity, namely residual insecticide spraying as adopted and practised in rural  vector control programmes in irrigation development project areas. Past  experiences (as during the National Malaria Eradication programme, 1958-1965) and  current practices are reviewed on the basis of selected examples. Eradication  programme, 1958-1965) and current practices are reviewed on the basis of selected  examples. In view of the current re-emergence of the disease, the states are  faced with new obstacles to residual insecticide spraying such as (a) the  development of resistance of malaria vectors to DDT and other alternative  compounds like BHC (benzene hexachloride), changing vector behaviour with  avoidance of contact with indoor insecticide deposits on walls, (c) environmental  contamination (risks of chemicals), (d) extensive use of insecticides and  pesticides for crop protection under an expanding green revolution agricultural  technology, particularly in irrigated areas and (e) the existence of outdoor  resting populations of the major vector Anopheles culicifacies and their role in  extra-domiciliary transmission, making residual insecticide spray less effective.  Spraying operations are also hindered by the persistence of certain social and  cultural factors. The custom of mud plastering, white-washing and rethatching  rural houses, for example, results in the loss of insecticide-treated surfaces.  Other outdoor rural activities persist as obstacles in attempts to break the  transmission cycle; washing, bathing and sleeping outdoors; illegal fishing and  woodcutting at night; poorly constructed make-shift structures;housing project  labourers near water sources; cattle grazing in nearby forests and human  population movements related to seasonal migrants. The chain and extent of the  transmission is dependent upon the malaria parasite carriers in the community  (both indigenous and imported types) and the degree of contact of the community  with those sites where people carry on the above activities, and on the  effectiveness of surveillance operations.",1982,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,243-255,,4,1,,Ecol Dis,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 6206995,,,,"Humans; India; Socioeconomic Factors; *Hexachlorocyclohexane; *Insect Vectors; History, 20th Century; *DDT; *Insecticides/adverse effects; Anopheles; Insecticide Resistance; Malaria/epidemiology/*prevention & control; Mosquito Control/history/*methods; World Health Organization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we applied Multi-omics  techniques to reveal the response of the intestinal barrier to CPZ exposure and  explore whether the Bifidobacterium intervention experiment can repair the  damage. First, we found that exposure to CPZ at environmentally relevant  concentrations led to intestinal injury phenotype, significantly down-regulated  intestinal protein gene expression, and up-regulated pro-inflammatory gene  expression, further causing intestinal dysbacteriosis and metabolic disorders. In  particular, by combining analysis of gut microbiota and metabolites, we noticed  acetate, a key metabolite, which decreased sharply after exposure to high  concentration of CPZ. Expectedly, after supplementing with Bifidobacterium (a  core bacterium that produces acetate), we noticed that the acetate content was  quickly restored. Further, we also verified that the increase in acetate content  after Bifidobacterium supplementation at least partially promoted IL-22  secretion, which in turn stimulated the secretion of β-defensins (zfbd-1, zfbd-2,  zfbd-3), thereby repairing the intestinal damage.

Transcript sequence data  obtained using Illumina's first generation sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) were  mapped to the transcriptome assemblies to estimate transcript representation in  different SBS libraries. SBS libraries included a S. homoeocarpa culture control,  a creeping bentgrass uninoculated control, and a library for creeping bentgrass  inoculated with S. homoeocarpa and incubated for 96 h. A Fisher's exact test was  performed to determine transcripts that were significantly different during  creeping bentgrass infection with S. homoeocarpa.

Inhibition of the binding  of [35S]TBPS by deltamethrin, a Type II pyrethroid, was modulated by GABA; both  the affinity and the efficacy of this insecticide increased with incremental  concentrations of GABA. Deltamethrin also enhanced the potency of GABA as an  inhibitor of the binding of [35S]TBPS. The interaction of 4'-chlorodiazepam  (Ro5-4864) with [35S]TBPS was dependent on GABA: in the absence of GABA, Ro5-4864  inhibited up to 40% of the binding; in the presence of 10 microM GABA, Ro5-4864  enhanced binding to a maximum value of 170% of control. However, the same  absolute amount of binding was observed with both of these effects at micromolar  concentrations of Ro5-4864. Also, Ro5-4864 caused a rightward shift in GABA  dose-response curves, increasing the IC50 value for GABA more than 6 fold. These  results indicate the reciprocal allosteric interactions between a binding site  for pyrethroids, a binding site for Ro5-4864, the GABA recognition moiety and the  binding site for TBPS in the brain of trout.

In this study, we tested the  effects of two reference toxicants, copper (Cu) and the pyrethroid insecticide  esfenvalerate  [(S)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methylbutyrate], on  lethal (mortality) and sublethal endpoints (growth, swimming behavior,  transcription levels of stress response genes) in juvenile (81-90-day-old)  striped bass (Morone saxatilis).

Quantitative real-time TaqMan PCR was used to  examine tissue-specific changes in the transcriptome of liver, spleen, white  muscle, anterior kidney and gills after 7-day Cu exposures and 24-h esfenvalerate  exposures. On the transcriptome level, exposure to Cu showed strongest effects on  the transcription of metallothionein in spleen tissue, causing a 4-fold increase  of mRNA at 42ppb total Cu and a 10-fold increase at 160 ppb Cu. Exposure to Cu  also caused significant tissue-specific changes in gene transcription for  immune-system related genes. Esfenvalerate exposure had tissue-specific effects  on the transcription of HSP70, HSP90 and CYP1A1. The most significant effects  were detected in liver tissue after exposure to 0.64 microg/L esfenvalerate. Our  results show that the stress response at the transcriptome level is a more  sensitive indicator for Cu and esfenvalerate exposures at low concentrations than  swimming behavior, growth or mortality.

It can exert several  actions on the immune system, growth and cellular metabolism, establishing a  fine-tune regulation stress response and cross-talk interactions with other  regulatory pathways. In this study, we investigated a causal relationship between  high levels of glucocorticoids and susceptibility to pathogens and modification  of gene expression profiles in Senegalese sole. For this purpose, we carried out  two experiments using post-metamorphic individuals (21 days after hatching) that  were exposed to dexamethasone (DXM), a potent glucocorticoid, in order to mimic  cortisol effects. We quantified transcript levels of a wide set of genes involved  in innate immune system (g-type lysozyme and hepcidin (hamp1)), HPI axis (crf,  crfbp, pomcα, pomcβ, gr1 and gr2), HPT axis (tgb), cellular stress defense system  (hsp70 and hsp90aa), GH/IGF axis (igf-I and igf-Ir) and the neuropeptide trh.  Short-term exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 ppm DXM provoked a reduction of pomcβ  transcripts and an increase of crfbp mRNAs in a dose-dependent manner at 48 and  72 h after treatment. Moreover, g-type lysozyme transcript levels decreased  significantly at 72 h whereas hamp1 mRNA levels increased at 48 h after exposure.  Long-term DXM treatment (10 ppm DXM) affected negatively weight of soles (~20%  lower than controls). Moreover, reduced mRNA levels were observed for pomcβ after  1 week and igf-I and hamp1 after 2 weeks. In contrast, crfbp and crf increased  mRNA levels after 2 weeks. hsp70 exhibited a dual response increasing transcript  levels at 1 week after treatment and reducing thereafter. No significant changes  in gene expression were observed at any time during this study for tgb, trh,  hsp90aa, pomcα, gr1 and gr2. Finally, a challenge experiment using the pathogen  Photobacterium damselae subsp piscicida confirmed earlier and higher mortalities  in DXM-treated animals. Taken together, these data indicate that a prolonged  exposure to DXM increases the susceptibility to pathogens and reduces growth.  Moreover, DXM can trigger a wide cellular response modulating the expression of  genes involved in the innate immune system, HPI and GH/IGF axes as well as  cellular stress defense.

The results revealed varying degrees of antimicrobial  activity of the crude extract against different bacterial and fungal strains,  with Leclercia adecarboxylata, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis showing  the highest susceptibility.

Here we describe the systemic destruction of macrophages and  neutrophils by the Gram-negative Photobacterium damselae ssp. piscicida (Phdp) in  fish pasteurellosis, a deadly systemic infection. Following experimental  inoculation, Phdp spreads by bacteraemia and colonizes the organs, producing a  septicaemic infection, and secretes the apoptogenic exotoxin AIP56 which is  systemically disseminated. In experimental and natural pasteurellosis,  destruction of macrophages and neutrophils by secondary necrosis following  caspase-3-associated apoptosis was seen predominantly in the spleen, head kidney  and gut lamina propria. Identical phagocyte destruction occurred after injection  of rAIP56, but not of heat-inactivated rAIP56, or AIP56-negative Phdp strains,  indicating that AIP56 is responsible for phagocyte destruction occurring in  pasteurellosis. Active caspase-3 and active neutrophil elastase are present in  the blood in advanced infection, indicating that phagocyte lysis by secondary  necrosis is accompanied by release of tissue-damaging molecules. The  AIP56-induced lysis of phagocytes represents a very efficient, self-amplifying  etiopathogenic mechanism, because it results in two effects that operate in  concert against the host, namely, evasion of the pathogen from a crucial defence  mechanism through the destruction of both professional phagocytes, and release of  tissue-damaging molecules.

In these areas, intensive agricultural  practices are performed in combination with high population densities. The  described problem is that together with agricultural practices and urbanization,  Brown necked ravens (Corvus ruficollis) are in huge amounts attracted. The birds  are very aggressive and showed to be a serious pest. They spread germs and  diseases for human health and food production. Therefore, the birds need to be  controlled. Our research focuses on identifying food preferences of raven and on  the way raven control is most effective. Ravens are omnivorous birds. From our  laboratory study it was seen that most preferable foods were, in descending  order: fresh fishes, cow liver, crustacean, watermelons, tomatoes and yoghurt.  Under field conditions where stomach content was dissected, animal matters showed  to a more preferred food source than plant matters. Observations on olfactory  sensitivity showed that ravens could easily locate their food. Biological  observations in the field on reproduction of ravens showed that raven females lay  two to six eggs. Average number of babies per nest was between one and four.  Average number of raven flock before sun rise was more than 100, while it was  less than 100 before sun set. The impact of mechanical, biological and chemical  control was investigated. Without control, approximately flock numbers of more  than 100 ravens were recorded. The average number of raven flock was 60 before  mechanical control operation (nests destroyed and using net), while it was 40  after mechanical control. Results of the biological control showed that kestrel  (Falco tinnunculus rupicolaeformes) predated raven babies more effective than  barn owls (Tyto alba).

In the current  study, we have cloned a nitroreductase gene, Salmonella typhimurium  nitroreductase A (snrA), from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain TA1535, and  characterized the purified gene product. SnrA is 240 amino acids in length and  shares 87% sequence identity to the Escherichia coli homolog, E. coli  nitroreductase A (NfsA). SnrA is the major nitroreductase in S. enterica serovar  Typhimurium strain TA1535 and catalyzes nitroreduction through a ping-pong bi-bi  mechanism in a NADPH and flavine mononucleotide (FMN) dependent manner. SnrA  exhibits extremely low levels of FMN reductase activity but the nitroreductase  activity of SnrA is competitively inhibited by exogenously added FMN. Treatment  of TA1535 with paraquat resulted in induction of nitroreductase activity,  suggesting that SnrA is a member of the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SoxRS  regulon associated with cellular defense against oxidative damage. Examination of  the microbial genomes databases shows that SnrA homologs are widely distributed  in the microbial world, being present in isolates of both Archea and Eubacteria.  Southern hybridization and PCR failed to detect the snrA gene in the closely  related S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain TA1538.

Although the whitefly is often controlled using chemical pesticides,  biological control agents constitute an important component in integrated pest  management programs, especially in protected agriculture. One of these agents is  the wasp Eretmocerus mundus (Mercet) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae). E. mundus lays  its egg on the leaf underneath the second-third instar nymph of B. tabaci. First  instars of the wasp hatch and penetrate the whitefly nymphs. Initiation of  parasitization induces the host to form a capsule composed of epidermal cells  around the parasitoid. The physiological and molecular processes underlying B.  tabaci-E. mundus interactions have never been investigated. RESULTS: We used a  cDNA microarray containing 6,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the whitefly  genome to study the parasitoid-whitefly interaction. We compared RNA samples  collected at two time points of the parasitization process: when the parasitoid  first instar starts the penetration process and once it has fully penetrated the  host. The results clearly indicated that genes known to be part of the defense  pathways described in other insects are also involved in the response of B.  tabaci to parasitization by E. mundus. Some of these responses included  repression of a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) and induction of a  melanization cascade. A second set of genes that responded strongly to  parasitization were bacterial, encoded by whitefly symbionts. Quantitative  real-time PCR and FISH analyses showed that proliferation of Rickettsia, a  facultative secondary symbiont, is strongly induced upon initiation of the  parasitization process, a result that supported previous reports suggesting that  endosymbionts might be involved in the insect host's resistance to various  environmental stresses. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine the  transcriptional response of a hemipteran insect to attack by a biological control  agent (hymenopterous parasitoid), using a new genomic approach developed for this  insect pest. The defense response in B. tabaci involves genes related to the  immune response as described in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster.  Moreover, endosymbionts of B. tabaci appear to play a role in the response to  parasitization, as supported by previously published results from aphids.",18/07/2008,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,342,,,9,,BMC Genomics,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 18638407  PMCID: PMC2488360,,,,"Animals; *Symbiosis; *Transcription, Genetic; Bacteria/*growth & development; Genes, Insect/*immunology; Hemiptera/*microbiology/parasitology; Host-Parasite Interactions; Wasps/*physiology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this end, we  are designing a series of deployable transgenic fish. Fish exhibit many of the  same general defenses against toxic chemicals as do mammals, including enzyme  induction, and the generation of oxidative stress. In response to many foreign  compounds that generate oxidative stress, the transcription of certain protective  genes is induced via specific DNA motifs called electrophile response elements  (EPREs). We have made a plasmid construct containing a single murine EPRE fused  to a minimal promoter and the cDNA encoding firefly luciferase (EPRE-LUC). In  this paper, we have shown that the treatment of zebrafish cell line ZEM2S with a  variety of chemicals known to induce EPRE-dependent transcription in cultured  mammalian cells, results in dose-dependent induction of the  transiently-transfected EPRE-LUC reporter construct. Compounds tested include  aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and organophosphates. We observed similar  dose-dependent responses when we treated ZEM2S and human cells in vitro with  identical aqueous extracts of soil from hazardous waste sites. This suggests that  the mechanism by which these compounds activate transcription is well conserved  between mammals and zebrafish, and that transgenic zebrafish lines containing  EPRE-driven reporter constructs might be useful as sentinels for the early  detection of oxidative stress-inducing chemicals.",02/07/2001,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,183-196,,01-Mar,274,,Sci Total Environ,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Netherlands PMID: 11453295,,,,"Humans; Animals; Mammals; Mice; Zebrafish; Animals, Genetically Modified; Apoptosis/drug effects; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Cell Line; Cell Survival/drug effects; Glutathione/*metabolism; Sentinel Surveillance; *Oxidative Stress/drug effects; Coleoptera; Embryo, Mammalian; Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/*physiology; Genes, Reporter; Glutathione Disulfide/metabolism; HL-60 Cells; Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology; Luciferases/*genetics/metabolism; Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology; Methylcholanthrene/toxicity; Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology; Plasmids; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins/toxicity; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Soil Pollutants/analysis/*toxicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all, 278  samples representing 37 types of feed-stuffs (components, as well as finished  feeds) and 18 countries were analyzed. Residues of chlorinated hydrocarbon  pesticides and PCBs were looked for in 224 samples, mostly feed components. The  analytical method used involved solvent extraction, florisil-column clean-up,  thinlayer chromatographic separation and gas-chromatographic determination.  Chlorinated hydrocarbons were found in several samples. DDT and its  transformation products were detected in 66 samples (29.5%), lindane in 44  (19.5%), PCBs in 25 (11.2%), alpha-BHC in 22 (9.8%), beta-BHC in 11 (4.9%) and  dieldrin in 9 (4.0%). The levels were usually low (Table I). The chloropesticides  occurred most frequently and at the highest levels in feed-stuffs of animal  origin and in imported oil-feeds. In 25 of the samples the contents of sigmaDDT  exceeded the maximum limit accepted by the National (Swedish) Food Administration  for grain and bran intended for human consumption (0.05 mg/kg, Talbe IV). The  highest residue level of sigmaDDT (0.66 mg/kg) was encountered in a sample of  fish meal. The PCB levels found did not exceed the temporary tolerance  established by FDA (1973) for finished animal feeds (0.2 mg/kg). One hundred and  seven samples were analyzed for phenoxy acid residues using a thin-layer  chromatographic and gas-chromatographic technique. Phenoxy acids were detected in  only 2 of 62 randomly selected feed samples (0.05 and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively).

Effects of single, sublethal pesticide exposure  on macrophages were determined by analysis of the cell viability, cell adherence  capacity, generation of superoxide anion (O2-), antigen processing, phagocytosis  of Salmonella typhimurium, and resistance to in vitro virus-induced cytopathic  effects (cpe) after infection with mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3). Most of the  studies were done for the organochlorine pesticide dieldrin, which inhibited  several macrophage functions, such as phagocytosis of S. typhimurium, release of  the single processed protein antigen avidin, and resistance to MHV3 virus-induced  cpe. The virus-induced cytolysis in macrophage cultures was significantly  increased after in vivo exposure to single sublethal doses of other selected  pesticides, such as guthion, carbofuran, sevin, and matacil. However, none of the  selected pesticides, used in sublethal (0.4 less than or equal to LD50 less than  or equal to 0.6) doses appeared to be a factor impairing the O2- -generating  system in chemically elicited or immunologically activated peritoneal  macrophages. In conclusion, sublethal pesticide exposure can induce a significant  impairement of several macrophage functions, such as phagocytosis, antigen  processing, and resistance to virus-induced cytolysis. Inhibition of the O2-  -generating system by sublethal pesticide exposure, however, can be excluded as a  mechanism of potential suppressory action of these pesticides on antiviral and  antibacterial host defence systems in which macrophages play a primary role.",1987-09,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,247-259,,02-Mar,1,,Mol Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 2835675,,,,"Animals; Mice; Pesticides/*toxicity; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Phagocytosis/drug effects; Superoxides/metabolism; Avidin/metabolism; Dieldrin/toxicity; In Vitro Techniques; Macrophages/*drug effects; Peritoneal Cavity/cytology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Description of a reference population.,International archives of occupational and environmental health,,0340-0131,10.1007/BF00380910,,"Recognition of the fact that impairment of the tactile sense may occur independently of other disturbances in the vibration syndrome has rekindled an  interest in developing a diagnostic method for early detection of  vibration-induced neuropathy. There is also evidence suggesting that vibrotactile  measurements represent a valuable diagnostic tool in compressive neuropathies,  such as the carpal tunnel syndrome. The method may also become useful for  diagnosing sensory neuropathies caused by other factors, such as solvents,  pesticides, heavy metals, alcoholism, and diabetes. However, before vibrotactile  measurement can be accepted and established as a tool for clinical diagnostic  purposes, for screening, and in research, the level and the shape of the normal  threshold curve have to be specified. With the purpose of assembling normative  data, the vibrotactile perception thresholds (8-500 Hz) of the right index  fingertip were measured in 171 healthy males (19-75 years) not exposed to  vibration. A Békésy audiometer was modified to operate in combination with a  vibration exciter, instead of headphones, at frequencies lower than usual (8-500  Hz). The results showed that the perception thresholds increased from about 100  dB to about 140 dB (rel. 10(-6) m/s2rms) as a function of frequency and age. The  frequency-dependent changes were not linear, however, but displayed a peak in  sensitivity at 125 Hz. Threshold changes due to aging were most pronounced at the  highest frequencies. It is of the utmost importance that these natural changes  are taken into account when making comparisons between groups or individuals.",1992,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,201-207,,3,64,,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Germany PMID: 1328063,,,,Humans; Male; Adult; Reference Values; Mechanoreceptors/physiopathology; Occupational Diseases/*diagnosis/physiopathology; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*diagnosis/physiopathology; Sensation Disorders/*diagnosis/physiopathology; Sensory Thresholds/physiology; Vibration/*adverse effects,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, proper know-how and use of prevention  methods is crucial. This study aims to assess the knowledge and practice of  malaria prevention methods among the residents of Arba Minch area, Southern  Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study that utilized a  two-stage sampling was conducted from January 22 to February 1, 2007 on a sample  of 454 household heads or their deputies. SPSS 16 for windows was used for data  analysis. Chi-square and Fisher's exact probability tests were used to assess the  association of selected variables with place of residence. RESULTS: Majority  (86.8%) of the respondents mentioned fever as a symptom of malaria, and 98.2% of  the respondents reported mosquito bite as the cause of malaria. Three hundred and  eighty four (84.6%) of the respondents mentioned mosquito nets as protective  measures against mosquito bites. The protective measure mostly used by the  respondents or other household members in the last 12 months was mosquito net  (73.3%) followed by aerosol insecticide (13%) with the former being used more in  rural areas and the latter in urban areas. CONCLUSION: The study subjects'  awareness regarding the cause, symptoms and preventive measures of malaria was  high. Use of mosquito net as protective measure against mosquito bites in the  last 12 months was high. However, use of other preventive measures was low.  Behavioral change communication is required to increase the use of other  preventive measures along with mosquito nets.",2010-11,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,185-193,,3,20,,Ethiop J Health Sci,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Ethiopia PMID: 22434978  PMCID: PMC3275842,,,,malaria; Arba Minch; knowledge; practice; prevention methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Azamethiphos is an organophosphate (OP) pesticide used to combat sea  lice infestations in farmed salmonids. Here, the sublethal impact on the blue  mussel, Mytilus edulis, of short term exposure to azamethiphos was determined.  The testing regime included biomarkers of exposure (acetylcholinesterase  activity), cytotoxicity (neutral red retention), immune function (phagocytic  index) and physiological condition (feeding rate). The distribution and  sensitivity of M. edulis acetylcholinesterase to inhibition by azamethiphos was  first determined, yielding IC(50) values of 0.736 and 1.30 mg l(-1) for gill and  haemolymph, respectively. Exposure of mussels to 0.1 mg l(-1) azamethiphos for  periods of up to 24h caused a significant reduction in acetylcholinesterase  activity in both the haemolymph (P<0.0002) and the gill (P<0.002), alteration in  cell viability (P<0.02) and decrease in phagocytic index (P<0.03). The feeding  rate remained unaffected. The results support the hypothesis that, in addition to  its neurotoxic effects, azamethiphos can modulate haemocyte function and immune  defence in M. edulis at environmentally relevant concentrations after only a few  hours.",2007-04,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,396-402,,4,54,,Mar Pollut Bull,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 17266995,,,,"Animals; Time Factors; Pesticides/*toxicity; Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity; Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism; Phagocytosis/drug effects; Hemocytes/drug effects; Mytilus edulis/*drug effects; Organothiophosphates/toxicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The  membrane damage was measured as the level of release of the UV-absorbing material  into the medium in which the cells were suspended and as the level of uptake of  propidium iodide in individual cells by flow cytometry. It was shown that of the  compounds tested, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (cetyltrimethylammonium  bromide [CTAB]) bound most efficiently. Tetradecyl betainate chloride (B14),  tetradecanoylcholine bromide (C14), tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB),  and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) followed and had declining degrees of  binding efficiency. The proportion of CTAB bound was almost total at  concentrations up to the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the compound,  whereas that of B14 was somewhat smaller. For the two remaining tetradecyl  compounds (C14 and TTAB), still smaller proportions were bound at low  concentrations, but the proportions rose disproportionally at increasing  concentrations to a distinct maximum at concentrations of 0.2 to 0.5 times the  CMC. We propose that interfacial micelle-like aggregates are formed at the cell  surface as a step in the binding process. An analogous, but less conspicuous,  maximum was seen for DTAB. Thus, great differences in the binding affinity of  QACs with different hydrocarbon chains at different concentrations to C. albicans  were observed. These differences were related to the CMC of the compound. In  contrast, the binding of TTAB to Salmonella typhimurium 395 MS was almost total  at low as well as high concentrations until saturation was attained, indicating  fundamental differences between binding to the yeast and binding to gram-negative  bacteria.

In the 1920""s to 1930s, thousands of people suffered from this disease in the country. Enormous efforts  were required to prevent further spread of the disease. A network was set up,  which consisted of a research institute and stations. A total of 200,000 cases of  malaria were still notified in 1934. Rapid development of the health  infrastructure and better socioeconomic conditions improved the malaria situation  and reduced the number of cases in 1946. Malaria was completely eradicated in  Armenia in 1963, and the malaria-free situation retained till 1994. During that  period, comprehensive activities were undertaken in the country to prevent and  control malaria. Since 1990, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the  situation became critical in many newly independent states. Economic crisis,  human migration, worsening levels of health services, and the lack of necessary  medicines, equipment, and insecticides significantly affected the malaria  epidemiological situation in the country. Malaria cases started to penetrate into  Armenia from neighboring countries. In 1994, a hundred ninety six military men  contacted malaria in Karabakh, which was unfavorable in terms of malaria, as well  on as the border with Iran and along the Araks river. The first cases recorded in  Armenia were imported, afterwards they led to the incidence of indigenous cases,  given the fact that all the prerequisites for malaria mosquito breeding and  development were encountered in 17 regions and 3 towns of the country. In 1995,  there were 502 imported cases and in 1996 the situation changed: out of 347  registered cases, 149 were indigenous. The Ministry of Health undertook a range  of preventive measures. In 1997 versus 1996, the total number of malaria cases  increased 2.3-fold: 841 registered cases of which 567 were indigenous (a 3.8-fold  increase). The overwhelming majority of cases were recorded in the Ararat and  Armavir marzes. In 1998, there were a total of 1156 cases, of them 542 being  locally contacted. The situation became stable thanks to joint efforts of WHO,  IFRX, the Armenian Red Cross Society, UNICEF, the Ministry of Health of Armenia  and its Government. Under Minister's Decree No. 292 of May 17, 1999, a malaria  project implementation office was established in the Masis Sanitary and  Epidemiological Surveillance Center of Hygienic and Antiepidemic Surveillance to  improve progress of the malaria control programme in Armenia. WHO allocated some  7,700 USD for 5-month maintenance and work of the office. Thus, analyzing the  malaria cases registered in 1999 and 1998 indicates a 1.9-fold decrease (616/77).  The setting up the malaria programme field office under the Minister's decree was  instrumental in planning and implementing activities in situ. In 1999, four cases  of tropical malaria were recorded in Armenia. The patients were Armenian pilots  who contacted malaria during duty travels: 1 in Sudan and 3 in Congo. The list of  pilots making flying to endemic countries was submitted to the Republican Center  to implement preventive measures in the future. In Armenia malaria surveillance  has been improved to ensure timely detection of all suspected cases and to carry  out malaria control activities. In this regard, a seminar was held for 21  entomologists and 12 parasitologists. UNICEF and WHO Armenian offices provided a  substantial support to organize seminars. To facilitate the seminars, the manual  ""Malaria parasitology and entomology"" was published and distributed among their  participants. On April 19, 1999, the session of the Ministry's Executive Board  (Collegium) gave recommendations to reinforce malaria control activities in the  country. Decrees No. 256 of May 31, 1999, No. 47 of May 29, 1999, and No. 245 of  April 30, 1999, ""On malaria and preventive and control activities"" were issued by  the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of Internal  Affairs and National Security to serve as a guideline for planning and  implementing activities. The Ministry of Agriculture undertook to clean the  collective irrigation (drainage) system covering 102 and 77 km in the Ararat and  Armavir marzes, the Ministry of Health provided a list of endemic foci where  cleaning was a priority. Taking into account the importance of the people's  participation in ensuring effective prevention and control, emphasis was laid on  health education activities: publication of leaflets, as well as articles in  local newspapers, radio broadcasts and TV shows. Throughout the season, the early  detection of malaria cases, timely hospitalization (in no later than 1-3 days)  for at least 5 days and subsequent treatment under direct supervision of a  physician were successfully carried out due to home-to-home visits. Entomological  studies conducted in the malaria foci show an increase in the presence and  density of a malaria vector in the buildings. As far as treatment is concerned,  the overall surface of stagnant waters comprised 2642 ha in 1999 (2733 ha in  1998), including 1285 ha of anophelogenic stagnant waters (2276 ha in 1998). The  biggest stagnant water surfaces were in the Ararat and Armavir marzes--2209 ha,  where the majority of malaria cases were recorded. A total of 1,283,111 and  559,213 sq. m. of constructions were treated in 1999 and 1998, respectively, out  them there were 1,259,637 sq. m. in 5 endemic regions. Stagnant water surfaces  were treated with bacticulicides on 250.7 and 743.8 (almost 3 times more) in 1998  and 1999, respectively. In 1999, 740 ha of surface were biologically treated  using Gambusia compared to 900 ha treated in 1998. There is no highly qualified  diagnostic specialists in many regions of the country, which necessitates the  holding of further seminars involving relevant specialists, in all malaria  regions. There is a tendency of geographical spread of malaria: malaria cases  occur in new regions and dwellings. A country-wide action plan was drafted for  2000, mainly focusing on staff training. With WHO assistance, a seminar was held  for 324 specialists from endemic regions. During the first quarter of 2000, 13  cases of tertian malaria were recorded as compared 59 cases during the same  period of last year. All these patients contacted malaria in the previous season  and demonstrated long incubation periods. Thus, the malaria control plan  recommended by WHO and the rational and targeted use of its assistance has shown  a 2-fold decrease in the incidence of malaria.",2001-03,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,21-24,,1,,,Med Parazitol (Mosk),,,,,,,,rus,,,,,,,Place: Russia (Federation) PMID: 11548307,,,,Humans; Armenia/epidemiology; Malaria/epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission; Travel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous study  demonstrated its 96 h acute toxicity on the crab Eriocheir sinensis. However,  studies on whether longer exposure to prometryn with a lower dose induces  toxicity in E. sinensis are scarce. Therefore, we conducted a 20 d exposure  experiment to investigate its effects on the hepatopancreas and intestine of E.  sinensi. Prometryn reduce the activities of antioxidant enzymes, increase the  level of lipid peroxidation and cause oxidative stress. Moreover, long-term  exposure resulted in immune and detoxification fatigue, while short-term exposure  to prometryn could upregulate the expression of genes related to immunity,  inflammation and detoxification. Prometryn altered the morphological structure of  the hepatopancreas (swollen lumen) and intestine (shorter intestinal villi,  thinner muscle layer and thicker peritrophic membrane). In addition, prometryn  changed the species composition of the intestinal flora. In particular,  Bacteroidota and Proteobacteria showed a dose-dependent decrease accompanied by a  dose-dependent increase in Firmicutes at the phylum level. At the genus level,  all exposure groups significantly increased the abundance of Zoogloea and a  Firmicutes bacterium ZOR0006, but decreased Shewanella abundance. Interestingly,  Pearson correlation analysis indicated a potential association between  differential flora and hepatopancreatic disorder. Phenotypic abundance analysis  indicated that changes in the gut flora decreased the intestinal organ's  resistance to stress and increased the potential for opportunistic infection.

Studies related to the immune functions and  activities of CD9 in teleost fish are limited. In this study, we characterized  two CD9 homologs, PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3, from Japanese flounder (Paralichthys  olivaceus). Sequence analysis showed that PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 possess  characteristic transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) structures. PoCD9.1 shares  70.61% sequence identity with PoCD9.3. The expression of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 in  the three main immune tissues was significantly induced in a time-dependent  manner by extracellular and intracellular pathogen infection, which indicates  that the two CD9 homologs play an important role in the response to pathogenic  infection. Following infection with the extracellular pathogen Vibrio  anguillarum, the expression profiles of both PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 were similar.  After infection with the intracellular pathogen Edwardsiella piscicida, the  expression levels of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 were different at different stages of  infection, especially in the spleen. The spleen was the most important tissue for  the PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 responses to pathogen infection among the three examined  immune tissues. Knockdown of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 attenuated the ability of host  cells to eliminate pathogenic bacteria, and PoCD9.1 knockdown was more lethal  than PoCD9.3 knockdown for host cells with E. piscicida infection. Overexpression  of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 promoted host or host cell defence against E. piscicida  infection. These findings suggest that PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 serve as  immune-related factors, play an important role in the immune defence system of  Japanese flounder, and display different functions in response to different  pathogens at different stages of infection.",17/02/2021,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,28,,1,52,,Vet Res,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 33597018  PMCID: PMC7890607,,,,"Animals; Transcriptome; Liver/metabolism; Amino Acid Sequence; Head Kidney/metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology; Cell Line; Models, Molecular; Anti-infectious immunity; Paralichthys olivaceus; Protein Conformation; Edwardsiella; Pathogen; Escherichia coli; CD9; Flounder/*genetics/*immunology; Gills/cytology; Iridoviridae; Spleen/metabolism; Tetraspanin 29/*genetics/metabolism; Vibrio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Organotin (OT) pesticides have been used in industrial and agricultural  applications, and OT contamination has been reported in water, sediment, and  fish. Carbamate pesticides are currently used in agricultural chemicals. Two  specific carbamates used in agriculture are ziram and maneb; ziram also is used  as an additive in rubber products including latex gloves. In previous studies we  demonstrated that at concentrations in the 150-200 nM range, the OTs tributyltin  (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT) were capable of disrupting the function of human NK  cells after incubations to as short as 24 h.

Pesticides are an important tool used in efforts to control insect  pests. About 20-30% of agricultural produce is lost annually due to insect pests,  diseases, weeds and rodents. While pesticides are effective against pest  populations, if used injudiciously, they may pose health hazards to humans,  domestic animals, natural enemies of crop pests and other forms of life through  unwanted contamination of food, feed, water bodies and the environment.  OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to examine farmers' level of  knowledge and awareness of environmental pollution due to unsafe use of  pesticides for controlling rice pests and to explore ways of reducing their  usage. METHODS: The research population consisted of 120 rice farmers: 40 farmers  randomly selected from each of the three rice growing districts of Bangladesh;  Mymensingh, Tangail and Jamalpur. Data was collected through group discussions,  direct observations and personal interviews during March 2013 to May 2014.  RESULTS: Farmers mainly sought advice on pesticide use from pesticide dealers or  retailers and a very few farmers contacted government extension workers for this  purpose. Most of the farmers had an understanding of natural enemies of rice  pests and that the application of synthetic insecticides in the field can reduce  their population. A few farmers followed integrated pest management (IPM)  practices with little understanding of the adverse effects of insecticides on the  environment and ecosystem. The majority of farmers understood the harmful effects  of pesticides on health of human and animals, beneficial species, fish, insect  resistance, soil and food. It was also found that education on pest management,  information through television, more contact with extension personnel and  farmers' awareness of IPM were critical factors for improving rice farmers'  understanding of the ecological hazards caused by overuse of pesticides. Most of  the farmers suggested that timely removal of weeds, appropriate timing for  pesticide application, balanced doses of fertilizers, pest monitoring, correct  dose of appropriate pesticides, pest tolerant varieties, increasing technical  knowledge and skills and creating social awareness of environmental pollution  among farmers were necessary to reduce the quantity of pesticides and minimize  environmental hazards. CONCLUSIONS: The present study identified a need to  intensify farmers' awareness and knowledge of integrated pest management and  environmental pollution through extension organizations which could help promote  sustainable agricultural development and improve the currently endangered  bio-diversity of Bangladesh.

During infection, AIP56 spreads systemically and depletes phagocytes by  postapoptotic secondary necrosis, impairing the host phagocytic defense and  contributing to the genesis of infection-associated necrotic lesions. Here we  show that mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMDM) intoxicated by AIP56  undergo NF-κB p65 depletion and apoptosis. Similarly to what was reported for sea  bass phagocytes, intoxication of mBMDM involves interaction of AIP56 C-terminal  region with cell surface components, suggesting the existence of a conserved  receptor. Biochemical approaches and confocal microscopy revealed that AIP56  undergoes clathrin-dependent endocytosis, reaches early endosomes, and follows  the recycling pathway. Translocation of AIP56 into the cytosol requires endosome  acidification, and an acidic pulse triggers translocation of cell surface-bound  AIP56 into the cytosol. Accordingly, at acidic pH, AIP56 becomes more  hydrophobic, interacting with artificial lipid bilayer membranes. Altogether,  these data indicate that AIP56 is a short-trip toxin that reaches the cytosol  using an acidic-pH-dependent mechanism, probably from early endosomes. Usually,  for short-trip AB toxins, a minor pool reaches the cytosol by translocating from  endosomes, whereas the rest is routed to lysosomes for degradation. Here we  demonstrate that part of endocytosed AIP56 is recycled back and released  extracellularly through a mechanism requiring phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)  activity but independent of endosome acidification. So far, we have been unable  to detect biological activity of recycled AIP56, thereby bringing into question  its biological relevance as well as the importance of the recycling pathway.",2014-12,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,5270-5285,,12,82,,Infect Immun,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

Chemical control  is achieved either by using synthetic or natural insecticides where the latter is  more preferable.

The objective of the present  study was to measure the total mercury concentration in giant otter fur samples  from an area in the southern Brazilian Pantanal. Fur samples from 19 otters from  different social groups were collected from captured animals or were sampled with  biopsy darts.

Determination of gene expression under in vivo  conditions constitutes a valuable tool in the assessment of microbial  pathogenesis. Considering that different hosts may represent different  environments for the pathogen, expression of Phdp virulence and in vivo induced  antigen (IVIAT) genes during S. senegalensis infection has been determined in the  present work. Increased transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in iron  acquisition (Irp1, Irp2, HutB and HutD), oxidative stress defence (AhpC and Sod),  adhesion (PDP_0080), toxins (AIP56) and metabolism (Impdh, Shmt and AlaRS) were  detected in Phdp infecting S. senegalensis head kidney or liver.

Studies on biocontrol agents combined with natural insecticides and  their possible effects on the immune defense mechanisms of termites are limited.  In this study, we investigated the effects of a combined biocontrol strategy  using a plant-derived insect ATPase inhibitor, α-terpineol, with the  entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) Steinernema carpocapsae against the  subterranean termite Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki. Survival assays showed that  even a low lethal concentration of α-terpineol significantly increased the  EPNs-induced virulence in C. formosanus. α-terpineol treatment majorly inhibited  the activity of Na(+)- K(+)- ATPase, which disturbed the EPNs-induced enhancement  of locomotor activity and grooming behavior in termites treated with the combined  strategy. Furthermore, the combination treatment had a synergistic inhibitory  effect on innate immune responses in C. formosanus, which were measured as  changes in the expression of immune-related genes and activities of immune system  enzymes. In conclusion, α-terpineol can weaken the immune defense of termites  against EPNs at low lethal concentrations, and is a suitable non-synthetic  insecticide to prove the biocontrol efficiency of EPNs on C. formosanus.

In this ultrasound-assisted microextraction (UAME),  chloroform was emulsified with an aqueous sample solution containing trace  fenitrothion (MEP) by ultrasonic irradiation (48 kHz) for 5 min. The emulsion was  then demulsified by ultrasonic irradiation (2.4 MHz) for 10 min. This resulted in  phase separation of the water and chloroform without centrifugation. The  demulsified chloroform was collected by a microsyringe and submitted to gas  chromatography-mass spectrometry. In conventional extraction with mechanical  stirring, the extraction recovery (ER) of MEP was strongly dependent on the  sample/chloroform volume ratio. However, in UAME, the ER was independent of the  volume ratio and the ER was >80 % when the enrichment factor was 40. In UAME, MEP  was rapidly extracted into the chloroform because of the large specific surface  areas of the small chloroform droplets in the oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion. This  gave a high extraction efficiency for MEP. UAME is a simple method requiring only  a change in the ultrasound frequency and with no pretreatment steps that could  contaminate the sample.

Increasing evidence suggests that many risk factors for AD are modifiable. AD  pathology develops over decades. Hence risk reduction interventions require very  long follow-ups to show effects on AD incidence. Focussing on AD risk, instead of  diagnosis, provides a more realistic target for prevention strategies. We  developed a novel methodology that yields a global approach to risk assessment  for AD for use in population-based settings and interventions. The methodology  was used to develop a risk assessment tool that can be updated as more evidence  becomes available. First, a systematic search strategy identified risk and  protective factors for AD. Eleven risk factors and four protective factors for AD  were identified for which odds ratios were published or could be calculated (age,  sex, education, body mass index, diabetes, depression, serum cholesterol,  traumatic brain injury, smoking, alcohol intake, social engagement, physical  activity, cognitive activity, fish intake, and pesticide exposure). An algorithm  was developed to combine the odds ratios into an AD risk score. The approach  allows for interactions among risk factors which provides for their varying  impact over the life-course as current evidence suggests midlife is a critical  period for some risk factors. Finally, a questionnaire was developed to assess  the risk and protective factors by self-report. Compared with developing risk  indices on single cohort studies, this approach allows for more risk factors to  be included, greater generalizeability of results, and incorporation of  interactions based on findings from different stages of the lifecourse.",2013-08,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,411-421,,4,14,,Prev Sci,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 23319292  PMCID: PMC3696462,,,,"Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Risk Factors; *Population Surveillance; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease/*epidemiology/prevention & control",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Widespread marine pollution such as oil spills, persistent organic  pollutants, metals, and ocean plastic pollution has been linked to concerning  changes in the ecophysiology and health of Galápagos species. Simultaneously,  illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing are reshaping the composition and  structure of endemic and native Galápagos pelagic communities. In this novel  review, we discuss the impact of anthropogenic pollutants and their associated  ecotoxicological implications for Galápagos species in the face of climate change  stressors. We emphasize the importance of considering fishing pressure and marine  pollution, in combination with climate-change impacts, when assessing the  evolutionary fitness of species inhabiting the Galápagos. For example, the  survival of endemic marine iguanas has been negatively affected by organic  hydrocarbons introduced via oil spills, and endangered Galápagos sea lions  exhibit detectable concentrations of DDT, triggering potential feminization  effects and compromising the species' survival. During periods of ocean warming  (El Niño events) when endemic species undergo nutritional stress, climate change  may increase the vulnerability of these species to the impacts of pollutants,  resulting in the species reaching its population tipping point. Marine plastics  are emerging as a deleterious and widespread threat to endemic species. The  Galápagos is treasured for its historical significance and its unparalleled  living laboratory and display of evolutionary processes; however, this unique and  iconic paradise will remain in jeopardy until multidisciplinary and comprehensive  preventative management plans are put in place to mitigate and eliminate the  effects of anthropogenic stressors facing the islands today.

Influent and effluent  wastewaters were submitted to solid phase extraction on Oasis HLB cartridges,  followed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography Orbitrap high-resolution  mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Orbitrap MS). Influent concentrations in both WWTPs were  notably higher than effluent, with caffeine, acetaminophen, irbesartan and  valsartan being the most ubiquitous compounds, exhibiting elevated  concentrations. Average effluent concentrations ranged from below the method  quantification limits (<MQL) to remarkably high values (μg L(-1) scale), such as  for caffeine, acetaminophen, diclofenac, irbesartan and valsartan, among others.  Removal efficiencies ranged between -273% for lamotrigine and 100%, i.e., for the  UV filter BP1.

In conjunction with refuges of non-Bt host plants, fitness costs can delay  the evolution of resistance. Furthermore, fitness costs often vary with  ecological conditions, suggesting that agricultural landscapes can be manipulated  to magnify fitness costs and thereby prolong the efficacy of Bt crops. In the  current study, we tested the effects of four species of entomopathogenic  nematodes (Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) on the magnitude and dominance  of fitness costs of resistance to Bt toxin CrylAc in pink bollworm, Pectinophora  gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). For more than a decade, field  populations of pink bollworm in the United States have remained susceptible to Bt  cotton Gossypium hirsutum L. producing CrylAc; however, we used laboratory  strains that had a mixture of susceptible and resistant individuals. In  laboratory experiments, dominant fitness costs were imposed by the nematode  Steinernema riobrave Cabanillas, Poinar, and Raulston but no fitness costs were  imposed by Steinernema carpocapsae Weiser, Steinernema sp.

In computer  simulations, evolution of resistance to Cry1Ac by pink bollworm was substantially  delayed by treating some non-Bt cotton refuge fields with nematodes that imposed  a dominant fitness cost, similar to the cost observed in laboratory experiments  with S. riobrave. Based on the results here and in related studies, we conclude  that entomopathogenic nematodes could bolster insect resistance management, but  the success of this approach will depend on selecting the appropriate species of  nematode and environment, as fitness costs were magnified by only two of five  species evaluated and also depended on environmental factors.",2010-10,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,1821-1831,,5,103,,J Econ Entomol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 21061986,,,,"Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Bacillus thuringiensis Toxins; Drug Resistance; Bacillus thuringiensis; Bacterial Proteins/isolation & purification/*toxicity; Endotoxins/isolation & purification/*toxicity; Genotype; Hemolysin Proteins/isolation & purification/*toxicity; Nematoda/classification/*drug effects/genetics; Pest Control, Biological/methods",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For protection of aquatic life,  regulators need to know what levels of contaminants a water body can tolerate,  without producing adverse effects. The USEPA has developed water quality criteria  for many chemicals, but few are for current-use pesticides. Other countries also  derive aquatic life criteria utilizing a variety of methodologies. As a prelude  to developing a new criteria derivation methodology, this chapter explores the  current state of aquatic life criteria derivation around the world. Rather than  discussing each methodology independently, this review is organized according to  critical elements that must be part of a scientifically defensible methodology.  All of the reviewed methodologies rely on effects data to derive aquatic life  criteria. Water quality criteria may be derived from single-species toxicity data  by statistical extrapolation procedures (for adequate data sets), or by use of  empirically based AFs (for data sets of any size). Assessment factor methods are  conservative and have a low probability of underestimating risk, with a  concomitant high probability of overestimating risk. Extrapolation methods may  also under-, or overestimate risk, but uncertainty is quantifiable and is reduced  when larger data sets are used. Although less common, methods are also available  for criteria derivation using multispecies toxicity data. Environmental toxicity  of chemicals is affected by several factors. Some of these factors can be  addressed in criteria derivation, and some cannot. For example, factors such as  magnitude, duration and frequency of exposure may be incorporated into criteria,  either through use of time-to-event and population models or by derivation of  both acute and chronic criteria that have duration and frequency components.  Aquatic species may be exposed to hydrophobic organic chemicals by multiple  routes. They may take up residues directly from water, or may be exposed  dietarily, or combinations of both. Unfortunately, to properly address such  multiple routes in criteria derivation, food web models are needed that work for  chemicals that have specific modes of action. Similarly, both bioavailability and  toxicity parameters may contribute to derivation of criteria, providing  sufficient data are available. Ecotoxicological effects and physical-chemical  data are needed for criteria derivation. The quality and quantity of required  data are clearly stated in existing methodologies; some guidelines provide very  specific data quality requirements. The level of detail provided by guidelines  varies among methodologies. Most helpful are those that provide lists of  acceptable data sources, descriptions of adequate data searches, schemes for  rating ecotoxicity data, specifications of required data types (e.g., acute vs  chronic), and instructions for data reduction. Many methodologies present  procedures for deriving criteria from both large and small data sets. Very small  data sets may be supplemented through the use of QSARs for selected pesticides,  and through the use of models such as ICE (for prediction of toxicity to  under-tested species), and ACE (for estimation of chronic toxicity from acute  data). The toxicity of mixtures is addressed by several existing methodologies.  In some cases, additional AFs are applied to criteria to account for exposure to  mixtures, whereas in others, concentration addition models are used to assess  compliance. Multiple stressors and bioaccumulation are also addressed in some  methodologies, by providing for application of additional safety factors. Methods  are also available for translating dietary exposure limits for humans or other  fish-eating animals into water concentrations. Options for addressing the safety  of TES exist, and rely heavily on data from surrogate species to derive criteria.  Utilizing partition coefficients, criteria may be harmonized across media to  ensure that levels set to protect one compartment do not result in unacceptable  levels in other compartments. Several methodologies derive criteria from entire  data sets through the use of statistical extrapolations; other methods utilize  only the lowest (most sensitive) data point or points. Utilization of entire data  sets allows derivation of confidence limits for criteria, and encourages data  generation. Criteria derivation methodologies have improved over the past two  decades as they have incorporated more ecological risk assessment techniques. No  single existing methodology is ideal, but elements of several may be combined,  and when used with newer risk assessment tools, will produce more usable and  flexible criteria derivation procedures that are protective.",2009,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,19-109,,,199,,Rev Environ Contam Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 19110939,,,,"Humans; Animals; Fresh Water; Databases, Factual; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Pesticide Residues/*analysis/*toxicity; Water Pollutants, Chemical/*analysis/*toxicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The application of certain techniques has the potential to  enhance various aspects of plant development, including growth, yield, proximate  content (such as protein and carbohydrate levels), as well as the ability to  withstand abiotic stresses such as herbicide exposure. The current investigation  focused on examining the influence of bioactive compounds derived from the  cyanobacterium Neowestiellopsis persica strain A1387 on enhancing the antioxidant  and anyimicrobial activity of wheat plants in their defense against the plant  pathogenic Sunn pest. The findings of the study indicate that the levels of  H(2)O(2) and GP(x) in wheat plants that were infected with aphids were  significantly elevated compared to the treatments where aphids and cyanobacteria  extract were present. The confirmation of these results was achieved through the  utilization of confocal and fluorescent microscope tests, respectively.  Furthermore, the findings indicated that the constituents of the cyanobacterial  extract augmented the plant's capacity to withstand stress by enhancing its  defense mechanisms. In a broader context, the utilization of cyanobacterial  extract demonstrated the ability to regulate the generation and impact of oxygen  (O(2)) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), while concurrently enhancing the  functionality of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione  peroxidase (GP(x)) enzymes within wheat plants.

Werres & A.W.A.M. de Cock was isolated from leaflets of wood rose (Rosa gymnocarpa Nutt.), a native, low shrub of the  Rosaceae family, at the Jack London State Park in Sonoma County, California.  Affected leaflets had cream-to-brown lesions or spots, sometimes delimited by a  chlorotic zone. Lesions coalesced with time and spread into the petiole and  rachis. Lesions on the stems were not observed. Isolates were typical of P.  ramorum with large chlamydospores and caduceus, semipapillate sporangia, and the  sequence (GenBank Accession No. AY526571) of the internal transcribed spacer  (ITS) region of the rDNA matched those published previously (4). The site was a  mixed forest containing some confirmed P. ramorum-infected trees of coast redwood  (Sequoia sempervirens), bay laurel (Umbellularia californica), and tanoak  (Lithocarpus densiflorus) (3,4). These sites also contained California rose (R.  californica Cham. & Schldl.); however, no symptoms were observed on this species.  A terminal leaflet of asymptomatic, pesticide-free, potted-plants of California  rose and wood rose (four plants each) was inoculated with zoospores of a P.  ramorum isolate (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, ATCC MYA-3281;  Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures, Baarn, the Netherlands, CBS 114390)  obtained from infected wood rose (2). A control leaflet of each plant was dipped  in sterile deionized water. Branches containing the inoculated and control  leaflets were placed in moist plastic bags, and plants were maintained at 21 to  22°C in the laboratory for 6 days. The inoculation experiment was repeated. In  both inoculations, brown lesions (extending up to 8 mm from the leaflet tip) were  observed on leaflets of both species 2 days after inoculation with P. ramorum. At  6 days after inoculation, lesions starting from the leaflet tip averaged 12.2 mm  in length (range 10 to 16 mm) for wood rose and 9.6 mm (range 3 to 20 mm) for  California rose. Some lesions extended into the petiole in both rose species.  Sporangia were observed in washings of the lesions from four plants of California  rose and one plant of wood rose, and P. ramorum was reisolated on  Phytophthora-selective agar medium modified with 25 mg of pentachloronitrobenzene  (PCNB) (4) from all lesions. Control leaflets had no lesions, and P. ramorum was  not reisolated. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a species of Rosa  as a natural host for P. ramorum, although R. sempervirens was identified as  being susceptible in artificial inoculations of detached leaves (E. Moralejo and  L. Hernández, personal communication). Toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia) in  California and salmon berry (Rubus spectabilis) in Oregon are the other known  hosts from the family Rosaceae (1). Wood rose is popular in the horticultural  industry and is readily available from native plant nurseries in California,  Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, Canada. California rose is also  popular, primarily in California. The pathogen could be disseminated on these  plants, especially since sporangia were obtained from inoculated leaflets of  these two species. References: (1) J. M. Davidson et al.

Qualitative  data on human behaviours and perceptions regarding malaria risk was triangulated  with quantitative data on Anopheles mosquito bites occurring indoors and outdoors  in south-eastern Tanzania communities where ITNS are already used but lower level  malaria transmission persists. Each night (18:00h-07:00h), trained residents  recorded human activities indoors, in peri-domestic outdoor areas, and in  communal gatherings. Host-seeking mosquitoes were repeatedly collected indoors  and outdoors hourly, using miniaturized exposure-free double net traps (DN-Mini)  occupied by volunteers. In-depth interviews were conducted with household  representatives to explore perceptions on persistent malaria and its control.  Higher proportions of people stayed outdoors than indoors in early-evening and  early-morning hours, resulting in higher exposures outdoors than indoors during  these times. However, exposure during late-night hours (22:00h-05:00h) occurred  mostly indoors. Some of the popular activities that kept people outdoors included  cooking, eating, relaxing and playing. All households had at least one bed net,  and 83.9% of people had access to ITNs. Average ITN use was 96.3%, preventing  most indoor exposure. Participants recorgnized the importance of ITNs but also  noted that the nets were not perfect. No complementary interventions were  reported being used widely. Most people believed transmission happens after  midnight. We conclude that insecticide-treated nets, where properly used, can  still prevent most indoor exposures, but significant risk continues unabated  before bedtime, outdoors and at communal gatherings. Such exposure is greatest  for rural and low-income households. There is therefore an urgent need for  complementary interventions, particularly those targeting outdoor-biting and are  applicable for all people including the marginalised populations such as  migratory farmers and fishermen. Besides, the differences in community  understanding of ongoing transmission, and feedback on imperfections of ITNs  should be considered when updating malaria-related communication and  interventions.",2019,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,e0217414,,6,14,,PLoS One,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 31158255  PMCID: PMC6546273,,,,"Humans; Male; Animals; Female; Infant; Child; Middle Aged; Adult; Adolescent; *Anopheles/parasitology/physiology; *Behavior; *Human Migration; *Malaria/epidemiology/transmission; *Models, Biological; *Mosquito Vectors/parasitology/physiology; Child, Preschool; Insect Bites and Stings/*epidemiology; Tanzania/epidemiology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also describes the pharmacological effects on cell  lines in culture (L5178Y cells, HeLa cells, HuTu cells and Jurkat E6-1 cells), as  well as on several types of bacteria (see below). The soluble venom of this  scorpion was fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and  collected separately in twelve independent fractions collected over 60 min run  (5 min time apart each other). The HPLC components of fraction VII were lethal to  all three species used for assay. The IVth fraction had a toxic effect on  freshwater shrimps. In this species, fractions VI, VII and VIII were all lethal.  For crickets, fractions V and VI were toxic and fraction VII was lethal. In  mouse, the lethal components were found in fraction VII, whereas fraction VIII  was toxic, but not lethal, at the doses assayed. The molecular weight of peptides  from the various group of fractions were identified by mass spectrometry  determination. Components lethal to mice showed molecular weights from 7013 to  7487 Da. Two peptides were obtained in homogeneous form and shown to be lethal to  the three species of animal used for assay. The soluble venom tested on L5178Y  cell line survival was shown to be cytotoxic, at 10-100 μg/mL concentration, when  compared to control murine splenocytes (p = 0.007).

A key component of this roadmap  is to provide universal national coverage with long-lasting insecticide-treated  nets (LLINs) in support of achieving the primary goal of reducing both morbidity  and mortality from malaria by 30% in the first three years, followed by a further  reduction of 20% by end of the programme cycle in 2020 1. The strategic plan  calls for this target to be supported by a comprehensive information, education  and communication (IEC) programme; however, there is limited prior research into  household and personal usage patterns to assist in the creation of targeted,  effective, and socio-culturally specific behaviour change materials. METHODS:  Nine separate focus group discussions (FGDs) were carried out in Dili, Manatuto,  and Covalima districts, Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, in July 2010.These  focus groups primarily explored themes of perceived malaria risk, causes of  malaria, net usage patterns within families, barriers to correct and consistent  usage, and the daily experience of users (both male and female) in households  with at least one net. Comprehensive qualitative analysis utilized open source  analysis software. RESULTS: The primary determinants of net usage were a  widespread perception that nets could or should only be used by pregnant women  and young children, and the availability of sufficient sleeping space under a  limited number of nets within households. Both nuisance biting and disease  prevention were commonly cited as primary motivations for usage, while  seasonality was not a significant factor. Long-term net durability and ease of  hanging were seen as key attributes in net design preference. Very frequent  washing cycles were common, potentially degrading net effectiveness. Finally,  extensive re-purposing of nets (fishing, protecting crops) was both reported and  observed, and may significantly decrease availability of nighttime sleeping space  for all family members if distributed nets do not remain within the household.  CONCLUSIONS: Emphasizing that net usage is acceptable and important for all  family members regardless of age or gender, and addressing the complex  behavioural economics of alternative net usages could have significant impacts on  malaria control efforts in Timor-Leste, as the country's programmes make progress  towards universal net coverage.",21/07/2011,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,199,,,10,,Malar J,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 21777415  PMCID: PMC3155971,,,,"Humans; Male; Female; Infant; Pregnancy; Child; Middle Aged; Adult; Aged; Young Adult; Adolescent; Mosquito Control/*methods; Infant, Newborn; Malaria/*prevention & control; *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Child, Preschool; *Insecticide-Treated Bednets; Focus Groups; Indonesia; Protective Devices/*statistics & numerical data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BIHCM4W6,journalArticle,2009,"Omona, Julius",Social marketing and the fight against malaria in Africa: population services international (PSI) and insecticide treated nets (ITNS).,East African journal of public health,,0856-8960,,,"This textual analyses on Social marketing, Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) and Population Services International (PSI) were undertaken to achieve two  objectives: (a) to contribute to the continuing debate and search for a better  strategy for combating malaria in sub-Saharan Africa; and (b) to contribute to  theory building on social marketing. The analyses revealed that Malaria has  reached an epidemic proportion and despite major inroads by PSI in combating  malaria on the principles of social marketing, the strategies of pricing and  segmentation of the clients are not appropriate for Sub-Saharan African countries  that are mired in absolute poverty where majority of the rural communities eke a  living on less than a dollar per day and the health sector does not receive  priority attention from policy makers and politicians. The descriptive statistics  and a one sample t test for the sampled countries suggest that sub-Saharan  countries have not even met the hypothesized 5% investment of their GDP on  health, compared to their counterparts, the developed countries, who are all  above this figure. The null hypothesis that there is no significant different  between the population and the sample means of both developed and a developing  country in their investments in the health sector was also tested and rejected.  Though the elements in some of the existent models and theories of social  marketing such as Health Belief Model, Theory of Reasoned Action, Social  Cognitive Theory and Trans-theoretical Models all attempt to advocate for  elimination of constraints and barriers to effective access to a service or  product, PSI is adamant to these and try to generalize these principles in all  contexts, including in Sub-Saharan Africa. The African scenario, where about 90%  of Malaria related deaths cases in the world occur, demands more than what these  theories present. Accordingly, it was concluded that however good intentioned  social marketing is, in the case of ITNs in this region, it is counter productive  as the pricing de-motivates clients who usually have other pressing needs to  address and segmentation limits coverage. Social marketing is thus more relevant  to developed economies where absolute poverty no longer exist and people can  afford to pay for health services. Malaria in sub-Saharan Africa needs a ""carpet  bombing"" strategy. It was also concluded that for Sub-Saharan countries to  effectively address the MDG six on malaria, and implement the Abuja Summit and  the Roll Back Malaria partnership declarations, it requires a high degree of  political commitment, amongst others, to enable the vulnerable communities have  access to free malaria treatment related drugs. Partners in the fight against  malaria such as PSI should adopt a more eclectic intervention strategy, and be  cognizant of the fact that the strategy that works for Africa should be that  which is based on strict equity and stimulates demand for ITNs. The paper  concludes by agreeing with Professors Curtis and Sachs that comprehensive malaria  control in Africa is achievable by 2010, at the minimal cost if sound principles  of public health and economics are observed. Millions of lives can be saved and  Africa will be given vital help in escaping from the viscous circle of poverty  and diseases that continue to grip the continent. The target for all intervention  efforts should be to eliminate the cost factor and ensure free distribution of  all malaria related treatment products.",2009-12,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,317-325,,3,6,,East Afr J Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Tanzania PMID: 20803927,,,,"Humans; Insecticides; Socioeconomic Factors; Africa South of the Sahara; Mosquito Control/*methods; Malaria/*prevention & control; *Insecticide-Treated Bednets; *Social Marketing; Bedding and Linens/*statistics & numerical data; Organizations, Nonprofit/*organization & administration",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few studies have been  performed to investigate the effects of these toxic agents on intracellular  structures of diatom cells. Nuclear alterations and cell wall abnormalities were  reported for diatoms exposed to toxic compounds. Nevertheless, the cellular  mechanisms implicated in the development of such alterations and abnormalities  remain unclear. Sensitivity to pesticides is known to be quite different among  different diatom species. Eutrophic and small species are recognized for their  tolerance to pesticides exposure. More pronounced cell defenses against oxidative  stress may explain this absence of sensitivity in species of smaller physical  size. Notwithstanding, on the whole, explaining the rationale behind tolerance  variations among species has been quite difficult, thus far. In this context, the  understanding of intracellular toxicity in diatoms and the relation between these  intracellular effects and the disturbance of species composition in communities  represent a key target for further research. The original community species  structure determines the response of a diatom community to toxic agent exposure.  Diatom communities that have species capable of switching from autotrophic to  heterotrophic modes, when photosynthesis is inhibited (e.g., after pesticide  exposure), can continue to grow, even in the presence of high pesticide  pollution. How diatoms respond to toxic stress, and the degree to which they  respond, also depends on cell and community health, on ecological interactions  with other organisms, and on general environmental conditions. The general  structural parameters of diatom communities (biomass, global cell density) are  less sensitive to pesticide effects than are the specific structural parameters  of the unicellular organisms themselves (cell density by species, species  composition). For benthic species, biofilm development and grazing on this matrix  as a source of food for invertebrates and fishes may also modify the response of  diatom communities. Environmental parameters (light exposure, nutrient  concentrations, and hydraulic conditions) affect, and often interfere with, the  response of diatoms to pesticides. Therefore, the complexity of aquatic  ecosystems and the complexity of pesticide to easily detect the effects of such  pollutants on diatoms. Clearly more research will be required to address this  problem.",2010,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,87-103,,,203,,Rev Environ Contam Toxicol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 19957117,,,,"Animals; Fresh Water; Pesticides/*toxicity; Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity; Diatoms/cytology/*drug effects",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND:  Multiple chemical sensitivity is poorly understood with few providers  specialising in its treatment. This lack of treatment and the ubiquity of  chemicals engender severe life impacts such as job loss, financial loss, social  isolation and even homelessness for persons who experience these sensitivities.  DESIGN: Survey. METHOD: We examined chemical incitants, symptoms and  sickness-related behavioural dysfunction as measured by the Sickness Impact  Profile in 254 persons self-identified with multiple chemical sensitivity.  RESULTS: Chemicals rated as causing the most symptomatology in respondents were  pesticide, formaldehyde, fresh paint, new carpet, diesel exhaust, perfume and air  fresheners. The five highest rated symptoms in this sample were  tiredness/lethargy, difficulty concentrating, muscle aches, memory difficulties  and long-term fatigue. Overall mean Sickness Impact Profile score was 25.25%,  showing serious impairment, with the most serious dysfunction in the categories  of work (55.36%), alertness behaviour (53.45%) and recreation and pastimes  (45.20%). CONCLUSION: Multiple chemical sensitivity is an important health care  issue because it often includes serious dysfunction, is poorly understood by  providers and poses extensive financial and treatment obstacles for those who  experience it. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Persons with multiple chemical  sensitivity seek medical treatment in a variety of contexts and informed  providers can both avoid iatrogenic harm due to medical exposures and provide any  possible treatment for the chemical sensitivities.

Relative species sensitivity was compared using three  procedures: standard acute toxicity testing, fractional estimates of lethal  concentrations, and accelerated life testing chronic estimation procedures. The  acutely lethal concentrations (ALC) resulting in 50% mortality at 96 h (96-h  ALC50s) were determined using linear regression and indicated that the three  herbicides were toxic in the order of picloram acid > 2,4-D acid > clopyralid  acid. The 96-h ALC50 values for rainbow trout were as follows: picloram, 41 mg/L;  2.4-D, 707 mg/L; and clopyralid, 700 mg/L. The 96-h ALC50 values for bull trout  were as follows: picloram, 24 mg/L; 2.4-D, 398 mg/L; and clopyralid, 802 mg/L.  Fractional estimates of safe concentrations, based on 5% of the 96-h ALC50, were  conservative (overestimated toxicity) of regression-derived 96-h ALC5 values by  an order of magnitude. Accelerated life testing procedures were used to estimate  chronic lethal concentrations (CLC) resulting in 1% mortality at 30 d (30-d CLC1)  for the three herbicides: picloram (1 mg/L rainbow trout, 5 mg/L bull trout),  2,4-D (56 mg/L rainbow trout, 84 mg/L bull trout), and clopyralid (477 mg/L  rainbow trout; 552 mg/L bull trout). Collectively, the results indicated that the  standard surrogate rainbow trout is similar in sensitivity to bull trout.  Accelerated life testing procedures provided cost-effective, statistically  defensible methods for estimating safe chronic concentrations (30-d CLC1s) of  herbicides from acute toxicity data because they use statistical models based on  the entire mortality:concentration:time data matrix.",2008-03,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,623-630,,3,27,,Environ Toxicol Chem,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 17975948,,,,"Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Species Specificity; Herbicides/*toxicity; Water Pollutants, Chemical/toxicity; 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid/*toxicity; Sensitivity and Specificity; *Trout; Picloram/*toxicity; Picolinic Acids/*toxicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

W.",Natural organic matter differently modulates growth of two closely related coccal green algal species.,Environmental science and pollution research international,,0944-1344,10.1065/espr2006.06.317,,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Humic substances (HS) comprise the majority of dead and living organic carbon, including organisms. In the environment, they are  considered to be chemically inert or at least refractory. Recent papers, however,  show that HS (including natural organic matter-NOM, isolated by reverse osmosis)  are natural chemicals which interact with aquatic organisms. They are taken up  and cause a variety of stress defense reactions which are well known from  man-made chemicals. These reactions include chaperon activation, induction and  modulation of biotrans-formation enzymes, or induction of antioxidant defense  enzymes. One specific reaction with freshwater plants is the reduction of  photosynthetic oxygen release. In this contribution, we compare the  susceptibilities (cell yield) of two closely related coccal green algae,  Monoraphidium convolutum and M. minutum, towards various NOM isolates. METHODS:  Cultures of M. convolutum and M. minutum were obtained from the algal collection  of the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Berlin, and  from the Culture Collection of Algae, Göttingen, and maintained in a common  medium. The cultures were non-axenic. The algae were exposed to 5 mg L(-1) DOC of  each humic material, an environmentally realistic concentration. Cell numbers  were counted microscopically in Neugebauer cuvettes in 5 replicates on days 1, 4,  7, 10, 14, and 21. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Almost all NOM isolates modulated the  growth of the algae. Only the NOM of a Norwegian raised peat bog lake did not  reveal any significant effect with M. convolutuim. In general, the results with  two algal species are by no means uniform. For instance, Suwannee River NOM  causes a decrease in cell density with M. minutum, but temporarily stimulates the  growth of M. convolutum. The opposite applies to Aurevann NOM: Growth increase in  M. minutum, but a bi-phasic response in M. convolutum. Different responses of  both Monoraphidium species must be attributed to intrinsic factors of the algae  rather than only to chemical features of the exposed materials, because the  exposures were identical with both algal species. The reduction in growth yields  can be explained as a herbicide-like mode of action that affects the photosystem  II most prevalently. The growth promoting effect remains somewhat obscure. It may  be due to (1) an increase in bioavailability of some trace nutrients in the  presence of HS, (2) the release of some growth promoting substances by microbial  or photochemical processing of the humic materials, and (3) a hormetic effect  upon the exposure of HS. Hormesis means stimulation of organisms or metabolic  activities when exposed to noxes in low concentrations. However, it is still open  to discussion why the growth promotion only applies to one or the other, but not  simultaneously to both Monoraphidium species. CONCLUSION: Exposure of the closely  related coccal green algal species to humic material changes their growth  characteristics. Since the reactions are not consistent within the two species  and the various humic materials, it seems that the less sensitive species is  favored by HS exposure. The environmental relevance, however, is subject to  future studies.",2007-03,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,88-93,,2,14,,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Germany PMID: 17455817,,,,Species Specificity; *Humic Substances; Chlorophyta/*growth & development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examined the  symptom and psychological profiles of 263 older adults (aged 60-90 y, 71% women,  29% men); 57% reported that at least one chemical and 17% reported that at least  four of five chemicals (pesticide, automobile exhaust, paint, new carpet,  perfume) made them feel ill. Cacosmia ratings correlated weakly and negatively  with age (r = -0.19, p = .001) over the whole sample. Cacosmia correlated  significantly with self-reported illness from foods that may mobilize or generate  opioid peptides (wheat, dairy, eggs) (r = 0.32, p < .0001) and with illness from  opiate drugs (r = 0.23, p < .0001). When the sample was divided into four cells  on the basis of above-versus below-median total chemical-induced illness score  (CI) and total food-induced illness score (FI), the high CI and high FI, high CI  only, and high FI only groups had more frequent indigestion, and the high CI  group had more frequent difficulty concentrating than the groups below median for  illness from both chemicals and foods (NOILL), even after covarying for age and  anxiety. The most cacosmic subjects noted higher prevalence of  physician-diagnosed allergies and irritable bowel than did noncacosmic subjects.  In contrast with previous young adult cohort studies, the older illness groups  did not differ with regard to sex distribution, depression, shyness, or  repressive defensiveness. When considered with prior surveys of young adults, the  present findings are consistent with the presence of previously established,  time-dependent sensitization to multiple xenobiotic agents in susceptible  individuals for whom psychological variables do not explain the symptom of  cacosmia. If cacosmia is a symptom of TDS, then the neuropharmacology literature  suggests the possibility of excitatory amino acid, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis, dopaminergic, and/or opioid involvement.

The regulatory  requirement for mutagenicity testing to support a pesticide registration is found  in the 40 CFR Part 158. The guidance as to the specific mutagenicity testing to  be performed is found in the OPP's Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, Subdivision  F, Hazard Evaluation: Human and Domestic Animals (referred to as the Subdivision  F guideline). A revised Subdivision F guideline has been presented that becomes  the current guidance for submitters of mutagenicity data to the OPP. The decision  to revise the guideline was the result of close examination of the version  published in 1982 and the desire to update the guidance based on developments  since then and current state-of-the-science. After undergoing Agency and public  scrutiny, the revised guideline is to be published in 1991. The revised guideline  consists of an initial battery of tests (the Salmonella assay, an in vitro  mammalian gene mutation assay and an in vivo cytogenetics assay which may be  either a bone marrow assay for chromosomal aberrations or for micronuclei  formation) that should provide an adequate initial assessment of the potential  mutagenicity of a chemical. Follow-up testing to clarify results from the initial  testing may be necessary. After this information as well as all other relevant  information is obtained, a weight-of-evidence decision will be made about the  possible mutagenicity concern a chemical may present. Testing to pursue  qualitative and/or quantitative evidence for assessing heritable risk in relation  to human beings will then be considered if a mutagenicity concern exists. This  testing may range from tests for evidence of gonadal exposure to dominant lethal  testing to quantitative tests such as the specific locus and heritable  translocation assays. The mutagenicity assessment will be performed in accordance  with the Agency's Mutagenicity Risk Assessment Guidelines. The mutagenicity data  would also be used in the weight-of-evidence consideration for the potential  carcinogenicity of a chemical in accordance with the Agency's Carcinogen Risk  Assessment Guidelines. In instances where there are triggers for carcinogenicity  testing, mutagenicity data may be used as one of the triggers after a  consideration of available information. It is felt that the revised Subdivision F  guideline will provide appropriate, and more specific, guidance concerning the  OPP approach to mutagenicity testing for the registration of a pesticide. It also  provides a clearer understanding of how the OPP will proceed with its evaluation  and decision making concerning the potential heritable effects of a test  chemical.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1991-11,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,259-283,,3,258,,Mutat Res,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Netherlands PMID: 1719404,,,,Humans; Animals; United States; Risk; Pesticides/toxicity; Public Policy; *United States Environmental Protection Agency; Hazardous Substances/toxicity; Mutagenicity Tests/*standards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rapport trimestriel de statistiques sanitaires mondiales,,0379-8070,,,"In the course of economic development from the pre-industrial to the post-industrial stages, human communities go through major social and economic  transitions. The demographic transition, a long established concept, refers to  the change from a stage of high birth rates and mortality rates to one of low  birth rates and mortality rates. The mortality rates have always decreased before  the birth rates, giving rise to a period of rapid population growth in each  society. The recently-coined term ""health transition"" provides a more detailed  view of the different aspects of the mortality decline and of the changes in  morbidity and causes of morbidity which also accompany economic development. The  health transition is associated with major changes in exposure to environmental  and occupational health hazards. The traditional hazards of the pre-industrial  stage include unsafe drinking-water, poor sanitation, infected food, tropical  disease vectors, indoor air pollution from biomass smoke, and accidents in  agriculture and fishing. Gradually these are replaced by or overlap with the  modern hazards, such as urban air pollution, tobacco smoking, pesticides,  occupational hazards in new industries and traffic accidents. The health impact  of these hazards depends very much on the preventive measures taken. For some  hazards there is an increasing health risk, in parallel with the increasing  occurrence of the hazard, which is followed by a decreasing health risk as  preventive actions become effective. This intervention transition does not occur  automatically with economic development, but requires specific policies and  plans, as well as community involvement. The adult age group (15-59 years) is  likely to be at particular risk for environmental and occupational hazards which  emerge during the health transition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1990,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,188-196,,3,43,,World Health Stat Q,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 2238699,,,,Humans; Middle Aged; Adult; Environmental Exposure; Occupational Exposure; Adolescent; Risk; Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity; Mortality; Demography; *Attitude to Health; *Social Change; Morbidity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eventually cytoskeletal  proteins and their macromolecular assemblies were established in eukaryotes and  assumed critical roles in cell movements, intracellular organization, cell  division and cell differentiation. In biomedicine the small-molecules targeting  cytoskeletal elements are in the frontline of anticancer research with  plant-derived cytoskeletal drugs such as Vinca alkaloids and toxoids, being  routinely used in the clinical practice. Moreover, plants are also major  material, food and energy resources for human activities ranging from  agriculture, textile industry, carpentry, energy production and new material  development to name some few.

As distribution of ITNs throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is being  scaled up, maintaining maximal levels of coverage will be necessary to sustain  current gains. The effectiveness of mass distribution of ITNs, requires careful  analysis of successes and failures if impacts are to be sustained over the long  term. METHODS: Mass distribution of ITNs to a rural Kenyan community along Lake  Victoria was performed in early 2011. Surveyors collected data on ITN use both  before and one year following this distribution. At both times, household  representatives were asked to provide a complete accounting of ITNs within the  dwelling, the location of each net, and the ages and genders of each person who  slept under that net the previous night. Other data on household material  possessions, education levels and occupations were recorded. Information on  malaria preventative factors such as ceiling nets and indoor residual spraying  was noted. Basic information on malaria knowledge and health-seeking behaviours  was also collected. Patterns of ITN use before and one year following net  distribution were compared using spatial and multi-variable statistical methods.  Associations of ITN use with various individual, household, demographic and  malaria related factors were tested using logistic regression. RESULTS: After  infancy (<1 year), ITN use sharply declined until the late teenage years then  began to rise again, plateauing at 30 years of age. Males were less likely to use  ITNs than females. Prior to distribution, socio-economic factors such as parental  education and occupation were associated with ITN use. Following distribution,  ITN use was similar across social groups. Household factors such as availability  of nets and sleeping arrangements still reduced consistent net use, however.  CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive, direct-to-household, mass distribution of ITNs was  effective in rapidly scaling up coverage, with use being maintained at a high  level at least one year following the intervention. Free distribution of ITNs  through direct-to-household distribution method can eliminate important  constraints in determining consistent ITN use, thus enhancing the sustainability  of effective intervention campaigns.",28/11/2014,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,466,,,13,,Malar J,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 25431086  PMCID: PMC4289357,,,,"Humans; Male; Female; Infant; Child; Middle Aged; Adult; Aged; Young Adult; Adolescent; Rural Population; Aged, 80 and over; Infant, Newborn; Malaria/*prevention & control; Insecticide-Treated Bednets/*statistics & numerical data; Child, Preschool; Disease Transmission, Infectious/*prevention & control; Health Services Research; Kenya",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same disease was  observed on greenhouse grown Asiatic hybrid lilies in Nipomo, CA in an adjacent  county. 'Monte Negro' was the most severely affected. Symptoms consisted of  necrotic leaf tips as well as 5- to 10-mm ellipsoidal necrotic spots on stems and  the abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces. Lesions were initially dark brown and  water soaked, becoming lighter as they dried. Although leaf spot symptoms usually  began at the leaf tip, eventually the entire leaf would become blighted. Disease  symptoms were not observed on Oriental hybrid lilies in the same nurseries. A  Botrytis sp. was consistently associated with the disease symptoms. In pure  culture, the fungus matched the description of Botryotinia sphaerosperma  (Gregory) Buchw. (anamorph Botrytis sphaerosperma (Gregory) Buchw.) (1). The  fungus is distinguished by its large, spherical conidia that average 23 to 25 μm  in diameter at maturity. The conidia are born in compact heads on unbranched  conidiophores. Conidia and conidiophores are hyaline when young. At maturity, the  conidia turn dark brown, whereas the conidiophores turn blackish brown. The  fungus formed abundant sclerotia on potato dextrose agar when incubated at room  temperature with 12 h per day of fluorescent lighting. The sclerotia were black,  ovate to sphaeroidal, had a rough surface, and were 1.5 to 2.5 × 1 to 2.5 mm.  Apothecia were not observed. Pathogenicity was tested on 12 Asiatic hybrid and 12  Oriental hybrid lilies. Inoculum consisting of mycelial fragments and conidia (1  × 10(5) conidia per ml) was produced on lily leaf agar (500 ml of H(2)O, 7.5 g of  agar, and 25 g of healthy, macerated lily leaves). Plants were inoculated by  rubbing leaves and stems with the spore and mycelial fragment suspension using  cotton swabs. Plants were maintained in a greenhouse at 25°C. After 7 days,  characteristic lesions were observed on the leaves and stems of Asiatic hybrid  and Oriental hybrid lilies, from which the same Botrytis sp. was consistently  isolated. Three control plants each of Asiatic hybrid and Oriental hybrid lilies  treated with water as a check, remained symptomless. Although studies to  determine potential fungicides for controlling this pathogen have not yet been  undertaken, good sanitation, a lily-free period, and steam sterilization of beds  should be considered in the management of this disease. In Europe, this fungus  has been reported as a pathogen on Lilium regale (2). To our knowledge, this is  the first report of this pathogen in North America.

Carpet in the bedroom or over concrete should be removed. For  persons who are sensitive to pet allergens, permanent removal of the pet is  recommended. Dust mite and fungus growth can be controlled by keeping the  household humidity level at less than 50 percent. Removing sources of food and  water and using insecticides will help control cockroach populations. Patients  who are sensitive to mold and outdoor air pollution should consider limiting  outdoor activities when these levels are high. Patients with asthma should avoid  exposure to tobacco smoke.

H.; Tibenderana, James K.",What drives the consistent use of long-lasting insecticidal nets over time? A multi-method qualitative study in mid-western Uganda.,Malaria journal,,1475-2875,10.1186/s12936-016-1101-4,,"BACKGROUND: The distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) through universal coverage campaigns is a widely adopted approach for the prevention of  malaria at scale. While post-distribution surveys play a valuable role in  determining cross-sectional levels of LLIN retention and use, as well as  frequently cited reasons for non-use, few studies have explored the consistency  of LLIN use over time, within the expected lifespan of the net, and the factors  which may drive this. METHODS: In this qualitative study, 74 in-depth interviews  were conducted with (male) household heads and (female) caregivers of children in  LLIN recipient households, as well as community health workers, in Buliisa, Hoima  and Kiboga districts in Uganda, 25-29 months following a LLIN mass campaign  distribution. A triangulation approach to data analysis was taken, incorporating  thematic analysis, most significant change and positive deviance. RESULTS: The  factors found to be most influential in encouraging long-term LLIN use were  positive experience of net use prior to the distribution, and appreciation or  awareness of a range of benefits arising from their use, including protection  from malaria as well as importantly, other health, lifestyle, social and economic  benefits. Social support from within the community was also identified as an  important factor in determining continued use of LLINs. Net use appeared to be  more consistent amongst settled urban and rural communities, compared with  fishing, pastoralist, refugee and immigrant communities. CONCLUSIONS: A multitude  of interplaying factors encouraged consistent LLIN use in this setting. Whilst  the protection of malaria remains a powerful motivator, social and behaviour  change (SBC) strategies should also capitalize on the non-malaria benefits of net  use that provide a long-term rationale for consistent use. Where supplies are  available, SBC campaigns should promote replacement options, emphasizing ongoing  net care and replacement as a household responsibility, thus reducing dependence  on free distributions. The triangulation approach to qualitative data analysis  enabled increased confidence in the validity of findings and an enhanced  contextual understanding of the factors promoting consistent net use in  mid-western Uganda. The approach should be considered when designing future  studies to explore factors driving net retention and use trends.",28/01/2016,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,44,,,15,,Malar J,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 26821799  PMCID: PMC4730749,,,,Humans; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Malaria/*prevention & control; Insecticide-Treated Bednets; Insecticides/*therapeutic use; Mosquito Control/*statistics & numerical data; Mosquito Nets/*statistics & numerical data; Uganda,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UQZ79QCY,journalArticle,2015,"Jefferson, Thomas A.; Curry, Barbara E.",Humpback Dolphins: A Brief Introduction to the Genus Sousa.,Advances in marine biology,,0065-2881,10.1016/bs.amb.2015.04.001,,"The delphinid genus Sousa has recently undergone a major revision, and currently contains four species, the Atlantic humpback (Sousa teuszii), Indian Ocean  humpback (Sousa plumbea), Indo-Pacific humpback (Sousa chinensis), and Australian  humpback (Sousa sahulensis) dolphins. Recent molecular evidence suggests that  humpback dolphins in the Bay of Bengal may comprise a fifth species. These  moderate-sized dolphin species are found in shallow (<30m), coastal waters of the  eastern Atlantic, Indian, and western Pacific oceans. Abundance and trends have  only been studied in a few areas, mostly in eastern Africa, China, and northern  Australia. No global, empirically derived abundance estimates exist for any of  the four species, but none appear to number more than about 20,000 individuals.  Humpback dolphins feed mostly on small fishes, and sometimes shrimps; occur for  the most part in small groups (mostly 12 or less); have limited nearshore  movements; and in most parts of their range exhibit a fission/fusion type of  social organization. Major threats that affect all the species are entanglement  in fishing gear, and habitat degradation/destruction from various forms of  coastal development. Impacts from vessel traffic (including behavioural  disturbance and displacement, as well as mortality and morbidity from collisions  with vessels) appear to be significant in most areas. Several other threats are  apparently significant only in particular parts of the range of some species  (e.g. high levels of organochlorine contaminants affecting Indo-Pacific humpback  dolphins in Hong Kong). Direct hunting only occurs in limited areas and primarily  on a small scale. Conservation actions so far have been limited, with most  populations receiving little study and almost no management attention. Much more  work is needed on humpback dolphin population status, threats, and how the major  threats can be reduced or eliminated. Extinction risks for the four species and  some populations are preliminarily re-assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria  in the current volume. The results suggest that all four species in the genus are  threatened at some level (suggested Red List status ranges from Vulnerable for S.  chinensis and S. sahulensis to Critically Endangered for S. teuszii).",2015,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,Jan-16,,,72,,Adv Mar Biol,,,,,,,,eng,© 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 26555620,,,,Animals; Ecosystem; Species Specificity; Population Dynamics; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Conservation; Animal Distribution; Atlantic Ocean; Dolphins/anatomy & histology/classification/*genetics/*physiology; Endangered Species; General biology; Sousa chinensis; Sousa chinensis taiwanensis; Sousa plumbea; Sousa sahulensis; Sousa teuszii; Status,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some people in malaria endemic areas  used ITNs for alternative purposes such as fishery and agriculture. It is unclear  why people threatened by malaria misuse ITNs. Here we develop a N-player mosquito  net game, and theoretically show that the misuse of ITNs might be underpinned by  individual and social rationality. In the mosquito net game, each player uses  ITNs for malaria prevention or alternative purposes. The proper ITN use decreases  the probability of malaria infection, while the improper ITN use increases the  player's labor productivity. Each player's expected payoff is influenced by other  players' strategies. We found that the misuse of ITNs can be a Pareto efficient  Nash equilibrium. The maximum number of players using ITNs for malaria prevention  is limited by insecticidal effectiveness of ITNs and extra income from ITN  misuse. Furthermore, we found that players in a low-income community are  attracted to the misuse of ITNs even if the probability of malaria infection is  high. Introduction of a tax on ITN misuse was shown to be effective to motivate  the players to use ITNs for malaria prevention. Our results demonstrate that  understanding decision making of people in malaria endemic areas is essential to  design more effective malaria control programs.",07/02/2014,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,39-46,,,342,,J Theor Biol,,,,,,,,eng,© 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In mammals, cathelicidins have shown to possess potent broad-range antimicrobial activity as  well as immunomodulatory activities. Therefore, we investigated the microbicidal  activities and localization of Cathelicidin-2 in non-infected and  Salmonella-challenged broiler chickens. Using immunohistochemistry,  Cathelicidin-2 was shown to be abundantly present in heterophils, localized in  the large rod-shaped granules, but absent in other peripheral blood cells and  intestinal epithelial cells. Cathelicidin-2 synthesis was observed to be  initiated at the early promyelocyte stage. Considerable infiltration of  Cathelicidin-2 containing heterophils was observed in the jejunum of Salmonella  enteritidis-challenged broilers within 8 h post-infection. Heterophils were shown  to release mature Cathelicidin-2 peptide upon stimulation with Salmonella-derived  LPS in a time-dependent way. Processing of the Cathelicidin-2 precursor was  mediated by serine proteases with a divalent cation dependency. Cathelicidin-2  peptide showed potent bactericidal and fungicidal activity against all tested  microorganisms, including chicken-specific Salmonella isolates. These results  underscore the importance of avian heterophils as a first line of defence against  invading pathogens and implicate that via heterophil-mediated release,  cathelicidins may greatly contribute to avian innate immunity.",2009-04,01/03/2024 5:20,01/03/2024 5:20,,1517-1526,,7,46,,Mol Immunol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 19187966,,,,"Animals; RNA, Messenger/metabolism; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; *Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects/immunology; Anti-Bacterial Agents/metabolism; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/genetics/immunology/*metabolism; Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism; Cathelicidins; Chickens/genetics/*immunology/metabolism; Gastrointestinal Tract/immunology/metabolism; Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology; Neutrophils/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism; Poultry Diseases/immunology/metabolism; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Rabbits; Salmonella enteritidis/immunology; Salmonella Infections, Animal/*immunology; Secretory Vesicles/immunology/metabolism",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about the role of beta-defensins in the chicken  digestive tract and their efficacy. In this study, the expression of chicken  beta-defensin gallinacin-6 (Gal-6) and its antimicrobial activity against  food-borne pathogens were investigated. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed  high expression of Gal-6 mRNA in the esophagus and crop, moderate expression in  the glandular stomach, and low expression throughout the intestinal tract.  Putative transcription factor binding sites for nuclear factor kappa beta,  activator protein 1, and nuclear factor interleukin-6 were found in the Gal-6  gene upstream region, which suggests a possible inducible nature of the Gal-6  gene. In colony-counting assays, strong bactericidal and fungicidal activity was  observed, including bactericidal activity against food-borne pathogens  Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Clostridium  perfringens, and Escherichia coli. Treatment with 16 mug/ml synthetic Gal-6  resulted in a 3 log unit reduction in Clostridium perfringens survival within 60  min, indicating fast killing kinetics. Transmission electron microscopy  examination of synthetic-Gal-6-treated Clostridium perfringens cells showed  dose-dependent changes in morphology after 30 min, including intracellular  granulation, cytoplasm retraction, irregular septum formation in dividing cells,  and cell lysis.

The present study investigated self-reported illness from  several common foods (wheat, dairy, eggs) and chemicals (pesticide, car exhaust,  paint, perfume, new carpet), symptom patterns, and psychological profiles of a  sample of young adult college students (n = 490, age 19.4 +/- 2.4, 52% female/48%  male). Subjects were divided into 4 groups on the basis of sample medians for  frequency of illness from the foods (FI) and chemicals (CI); high FI with high CI  (FI/CI), high FI alone, high CI alone, and NOILL (low FI and CI). FI was  associated with more defensiveness (denial of negativity) while CI was linked  with more shyness (avoidance of novelty). Women outnumbered men in all groups  (FI/CI: 61%; FI: 80% CI: 55%) except the NOILL (40% women). Nevertheless, the  FI/CI, FI, and/or CI groups still had significantly higher total symptom scores  as well as more indigestion, headache, and memory trouble than did the NOILL  group, even after depression, anxiety, shyness, defensiveness, and gender were  covaried. The illness groups reported significantly more limitation of foods that  mobilize endogenous opioids or generate exogenous opioids (sweets, fats, bread)  as well as more illness from opiate drugs, small amounts of beverage alcohol, and  late meals. Nasal symptoms from pollens or animals were more common in the FI/CI  (42%) and CI (42%) than in FI (26%) or NOILL (28%) groups. Premenstrual tension  syndrome and irritable bowel were also more common in the FI/CI group. The  findings indicate that young adults outside the clinical setting who are  relatively higher in FI and/or CI have distinctive symptom and psychological  patterns. Covariate analyses suggest that important symptoms in FI and CI  individuals such as indigestion, headache, and memory problems may occur in  addition to rather than as simply part of emotional distress.
